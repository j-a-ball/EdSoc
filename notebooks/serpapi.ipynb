Three-level analyses (HLM 6) of data gathered in 2004-2005 from 11,872 third- and fifth-grade students in 146 tracks in a representative sample of 85 secondary schools in Flanders (Belgium) confirmed the impact of tracking on boys' as well as girls' study involvement. Boys are, generally, less involved in studying than girls, and boys are more affected by track position than girls are, enlarging the gender gap in the lower tracks. In these tracks, boys are more prone to misconduct and rather poor future perspectives. Finally, girls in arts tracks are, on average, more involved in studying than girls in academic tracks, but because of their higher tendency for disruptive behavior in school, this does not show.\", 'subject': ['Gender Differences', 'Track System (Education)', 'Foreign Countries', 'Secondary School Students', 'Behavior Problems', 'Correlation', 'Grade 3', 'Grade 5', 'Elementary School Students', 'Study Habits', 'Ability Grouping', 'Academic Aspiration', 'Higher Education', 'Grade Point Average', 'Hierarchical Linear Modeling', 'Statistical Analysis', 'Questionnaires'], 'publicationtype': ['Journal Articles', 'Reports - Research'], 'publicationdateyear': 2017, 'language': ['English'], 'issn': ['ISSN-0038-0407'], 'publisher': 'SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.
