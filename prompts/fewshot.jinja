## Categorical schema: Each input contains information indicating whether an article is either (1) "quantitative" or (2) "qualitative" in terms of methods; whether its focus is specifically (3) "primary/secondary" education, (4) "tertiary" education, or neither; and finally, which one of the following eight topical labels best describes the article's primary focus: (5) "inequality", (6) "nonstructural", (7) "culture", (8) "school", (9) "state", (10) "labor", (11) "comparative", (12) "methods".
