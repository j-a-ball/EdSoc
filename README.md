# The “Collective Mind” and the Machine: Grounding AI language models in the sociology of education so they can perform research assistance tasks

## Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) are million-, billion-, and even trillion-parameter AI models used to generate sequences of text and code. LLMs can perform basic research assistance tasks, such as document summary and labeling. These capabilities are demonstrated by replicating the categorical coding analysis reported in a prior Sociology of Education review article (Brint 2013). LLMs are employed to scale up the prior analysis by a factor of 10, covering all original Sociology of Education research articles (n = 1,035), as well as articles published in related journals (n = 6,015). State-of-the-art models created by OpenAI and Meta AI showcase the effectiveness of different prompting techniques. Overall, the sociology of education as a subdiscipline is shown to be more cohesive when viewed from an interdisciplinary perspective, represented in this case by the ERIC database. Results of the AI-assisted qualitative coding analysis reveal that articles published in peer journals cover gaps in the literature identified by prior reviews. Finally, it is shown that AI language models can learn in-context to act as sociological research assistants, for example, by reviewing and analyzing large collections of documents.
