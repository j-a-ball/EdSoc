    <arr name="author">
      <str>Roof, Wade Clark</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This study examines the relationship of religious orthodoxy to prejudice against minorities using a world-view perspective. It is argued that both religious belief and intolerance toward minorities are reflections of a localistic world view. An implication that can be drawn is the importance of education in developing a "breadth of perspective." (Author/JH)</str>

    <str name="description">Durkheim's theory of anomie is traced and argued to be a major development that followed the publication of &amp;quot;Suicide.&amp;quot; Recognition of anomie as a macrosociological problem rendered it insoluble by Durkeheim's practical-humanistic orientation. In this connection his remedial proposals -- occupational, political, education, and &amp;quot;creation and renewal&amp;quot; -- are analyzed. (JH)</str>

Concludes that whatever measures are used, violent crimes are found to be intraracial (within racial classifications) to a far greater extent than statistically expected. (Author/JDH)</str>

Contrary to theoretical expectations, the data show a decisive acceleration in the growth of the managerial class. Internationalization of business and technological and organizational changes are factors which contributed to this result. (JDH)</str>

    <str name="description">This critique of the "orthodox radical" interpretation of social classes argues that the predominance of middle- class wage earners and women moving into the nonmanual job market constitutes a departure from the traditional "working class". Better working conditions and wages are the nonmanual workers' incentives to ally themselves with management. (AM)</str>
