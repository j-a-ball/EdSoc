Analyses reveal that wealth affects achievement through its effect on the amount of cultural capital to which a child is exposed. Because blacks have substantially less wealth than do whites, wealth can help to explain a portion of the racial achievement gap. The implications of the findings are discussed.", "publication_info": {"summary": "AJ Orr - Sociology of education, 2003 - JSTOR"}, "inline_links": {"serpapi_cite_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?engine=google_scholar_cite&hl=en&q=-7JFSuM7S-oJ", "cited_by": {"total": 729, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=16882653475518132987&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "cites_id": "16882653475518132987", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=2005&cites=16882653475518132987&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}, "related_pages_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:-7JFSuM7S-oJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Black-White+Differences+in+Achievement:+The+Importance+of+Wealth.+Orr,+Amy+J.+Sociology+of+Education&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "serpapi_related_pages_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C5&engine=google_scholar&hl=en&q=related%3A-7JFSuM7S-oJ%3Ascholar.google.com%2F", "versions": {"total": 10, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16882653475518132987&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "cluster_id": "16882653475518132987", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C5&cluster=16882653475518132987&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}}}]}
