Although some previous works have attacked the idea that schooling expands in response to technical change, we find that technical change has been an important, though not dominant, factor in expanding primary-and secondary-school enrollments.

Previous studies have shown that the presence of nativist, Protestant-millenial groups was associated with the early expansion of public primary enrollments. Immigrant groups provide an important contrast to such groups, and several interpretive histories of United States education stress the relationship between immigration and schooling.
