This phenomenon appears to be independent of the first/later-born effect. The finding turned up accidentally during a limited cross-cultural study of immigrants and is reported for its intriguing value and to invite replications. Some theoretical considerations are suggested and some practical implications are noted.", "publication_info": {"summary": "M Inbar, C Adler - Sociology of Education, 1976 - JSTOR"}, "inline_links": {"serpapi_cite_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?engine=google_scholar_cite&hl=en&q=x_0rCjDR0Q8J", "cited_by": {"total": 29, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=1139922184960736711&as_sdt=5,39&sciodt=0,39&hl=en", "cites_id": "1139922184960736711", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=5%2C39&cites=1139922184960736711&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}, "related_pages_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:x_0rCjDR0Q8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=The+Vulnerable+Age:+A+Serendipitous+Finding+Inbar,+Michael+Adler,+Chaim+Sociology+of+Education&hl=en&as_sdt=0,39", "serpapi_related_pages_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C39&engine=google_scholar&hl=en&q=related%3Ax_0rCjDR0Q8J%3Ascholar.google.com%2F", "versions": {"total": 3, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1139922184960736711&hl=en&as_sdt=0,39", "cluster_id": "1139922184960736711", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C39&cluster=1139922184960736711&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}}}]}
