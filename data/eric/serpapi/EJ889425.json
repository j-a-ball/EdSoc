On the one hand, there are oversocialized accounts that claim that rules, social background factors, and supply-side factors shape observed career patterns. On the other hand, there are undersocialized accounts that claim that the decisions of strategic agents and demand-side dynamics shape course-taking careers. In this article, the authors use simulations to illustrate how these theoretical mechanisms can generate course-taking \u2026", "publication_info": {"summary": "DA McFarland, S Rodan - Sociology of Education, 2009 - journals.sagepub.com", "authors": [{"name": "DA McFarland", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nx8clgcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=nx8clgcAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en", "author_id": "nx8clgcAAAAJ"}, {"name": "S Rodan", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ta-ZYskAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=ta-ZYskAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en", "author_id": "ta-ZYskAAAAJ"}]}, "resources": [{"title": "stanford.edu", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://ed.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/mcfarland/mcfarland_rodan.pdf"}], "inline_links": {"serpapi_cite_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?engine=google_scholar_cite&hl=en&q=ckPz_q8H1aMJ", "cited_by": {"total": 14, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=11805350450699649906&as_sdt=5,44&sciodt=0,44&hl=en", "cites_id": "11805350450699649906", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=5%2C44&cites=11805350450699649906&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}, "related_pages_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:ckPz_q8H1aMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Organization+by+Design:+Supply-+and+Demand-Side+Models+of+Mathematics+Course+Taking+McFarland,+Daniel+A.+Rodan,+Simon+Sociology+of+Education&hl=en&as_sdt=0,44", "serpapi_related_pages_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C44&engine=google_scholar&hl=en&q=related%3AckPz_q8H1aMJ%3Ascholar.google.com%2F", "versions": {"total": 10, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11805350450699649906&hl=en&as_sdt=0,44", "cluster_id": "11805350450699649906", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C44&cluster=11805350450699649906&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}}}]}
