Using panel data on high school sophomores from the High School and Beyond (HSB) survey, we estimate a number of linear panel models.

Academic achievement in the sophomore year has little effect on changes in misbehavior \u2026", "publication_info": {"summary": "DE Myers, AM Milne, K Baker, A Ginsburg - Sociology of Education, 1987 - JSTOR"}, "inline_links": {"serpapi_cite_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?engine=google_scholar_cite&hl=en&q=ZoKRgEWIUu8J", "cited_by": {"total": 150, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=17244995755246191206&as_sdt=5,44&sciodt=0,44&hl=en", "cites_id": "17244995755246191206", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=5%2C44&cites=17244995755246191206&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}, "related_pages_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:ZoKRgEWIUu8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Student+Discipline+and+High+School+Performance.+Myers,+David+E.+And+Others+Sociology+of+Education&hl=en&as_sdt=0,44", "serpapi_related_pages_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C44&engine=google_scholar&hl=en&q=related%3AZoKRgEWIUu8J%3Ascholar.google.com%2F", "versions": {"total": 4, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17244995755246191206&hl=en&as_sdt=0,44", "cluster_id": "17244995755246191206", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C44&cluster=17244995755246191206&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}}}]}
