Drawing on a variety of analytic techniques, we find that Catholic schools have a positive effect on verbal and mathematics achievement growth from the sophomore to senior year of high school. The magnitude of the Catholic-school effects ranges from about one-half to one grade equivalent for students of average background \u2026", "publication_info": {"summary": "T Hoffer, AM Greeley, JS Coleman - Sociology of education, 1985 - JSTOR"}, "inline_links": {"serpapi_cite_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?engine=google_scholar_cite&hl=en&q=9CB0rnGNcgwJ", "cited_by": {"total": 498, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=896934795197817076&as_sdt=805&sciodt=0,3&hl=en", "cites_id": "896934795197817076", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=805&cites=896934795197817076&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}, "related_pages_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:9CB0rnGNcgwJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Achievement+Growth+in+Public+and+Catholic+Schools.+Hoffer,+Thomas+And+Others+Sociology+of+Education&hl=en&as_sdt=0,3", "serpapi_related_pages_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C3&engine=google_scholar&hl=en&q=related%3A9CB0rnGNcgwJ%3Ascholar.google.com%2F", "versions": {"total": 5, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=896934795197817076&hl=en&as_sdt=0,3", "cluster_id": "896934795197817076", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C3&cluster=896934795197817076&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}}}]}
