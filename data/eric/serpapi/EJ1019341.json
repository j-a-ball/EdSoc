But what influences teachers' networks? Why do some teachers have networks that are likely to support individual and organizational change, while others do not? This study is a first step in answering this question. We focus on how district policy influences the quality and configuration of teachers' social networks. We draw on a longitudinal, qualitative study of implementation of a mathematics curriculum in four schools.
