It was hypothesized that parents will express higher levels of support for increases in public school taxes than will nonparents. Data were drawn from the 1988 Orange County (California) Annual Survey (n= 1,008). The results generally confirm the hypothesis, but suggest that political ideology is an even stronger correlate of support for public education.", "publication_info": {"summary": "KSY Chew - Sociology of Education, 1992 - JSTOR", "authors": [{"name": "KSY Chew", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d9bJdO4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=d9bJdO4AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en", "author_id": "d9bJdO4AAAAJ"}]}, "inline_links": {"serpapi_cite_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?engine=google_scholar_cite&hl=en&q=-_i8zoYXSGkJ", "cited_by": {"total": 48, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=7586339440067148027&as_sdt=8000005&sciodt=0,19&hl=en", "cites_id": "7586339440067148027", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=8000005&cites=7586339440067148027&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}, "related_pages_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:-_i8zoYXSGkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=The+Demographic+Erosion+of+Political+Support+for+Public+Education:+A+Suburban+Case+Study.+Chew,+Kenneth+S.+Y.+Sociology+of+Education&hl=en&as_sdt=0,19", "serpapi_related_pages_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C19&engine=google_scholar&hl=en&q=related%3A-_i8zoYXSGkJ%3Ascholar.google.com%2F", "versions": {"total": 6, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7586339440067148027&hl=en&as_sdt=0,19", "cluster_id": "7586339440067148027", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C19&cluster=7586339440067148027&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}}}]}
