Because of lower levels of achievement, prior course taking, and lower socioeconomic status, black students are much more likely than are white students to be enrolled in low-track mathematics courses by the 10th grade. Using multilevel models for categorical outcomes, the study found that the black-white gap in mathematics course taking is the greatest in integrated \u2026", "publication_info": {"summary": "S Kelly - Sociology of Education, 2009 - journals.sagepub.com", "authors": [{"name": "S Kelly", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rv2nNyAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=rv2nNyAAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en", "author_id": "rv2nNyAAAAAJ"}]}, "resources": [{"title": "wceruw.org", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "http://msan.wceruw.org/documents/resources_for_educators/Mathematics/Black%20White%20Gap%20Math%20Coursetaking.pdf"}], "inline_links": {"serpapi_cite_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?engine=google_scholar_cite&hl=en&q=YY2GQaDvAVMJ", "cited_by": {"total": 255, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=5981325251697872225&as_sdt=5,24&sciodt=0,24&hl=en", "cites_id": "5981325251697872225", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=5%2C24&cites=5981325251697872225&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}, "related_pages_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:YY2GQaDvAVMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=The+Black-White+Gap+in+Mathematics+Course+Taking+Kelly,+Sean+Sociology+of+Education&hl=en&as_sdt=0,24", "serpapi_related_pages_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C24&engine=google_scholar&hl=en&q=related%3AYY2GQaDvAVMJ%3Ascholar.google.com%2F", "versions": {"total": 7, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5981325251697872225&hl=en&as_sdt=0,24", "cluster_id": "5981325251697872225", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C24&cluster=5981325251697872225&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}}}]}
