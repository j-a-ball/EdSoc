The findings of this study indicate that the apparent negative relationship between faculty status and support of labor activism partially disappears when academic field is controlled. While junior faculty in less technical fields are more receptive to such labor practices than senior colleagues in these fields, there is no significant difference between the receptiveness to these tactics of junior and senior faculty \u2026", "publication_info": {"summary": "HL Nixon - Sociology of Education, 1975 - JSTOR"}, "inline_links": {"serpapi_cite_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?engine=google_scholar_cite&hl=en&q=mEq4UG01pNwJ", "cited_by": {"total": 17, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=15898891328146655896&as_sdt=5,44&sciodt=0,44&hl=en", "cites_id": "15898891328146655896", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=5%2C44&cites=15898891328146655896&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}, "related_pages_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:mEq4UG01pNwJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Faculty+Support+of+Traditional+Labor+Tactics+on+Campus+Nixon,+Howard+L.,+II+Sociology+of+Education&hl=en&as_sdt=0,44", "serpapi_related_pages_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C44&engine=google_scholar&hl=en&q=related%3AmEq4UG01pNwJ%3Ascholar.google.com%2F", "versions": {"total": 2, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15898891328146655896&hl=en&as_sdt=0,44", "cluster_id": "15898891328146655896", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C44&cluster=15898891328146655896&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}}}]}
