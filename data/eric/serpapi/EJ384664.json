In this article, the authors examine this issue by analyzing the responses of faculty members and students to differences in a variety of feminist classrooms. The analysis suggests that when differences in knowledge, class, or sexuality arise, a hierarchical mode of conceptualizing and responding to differences typically emerges. The authors discuss why this pattern of response occurs and offer suggestions for changing it.", "publication_info": {"summary": "S Gardner, C Dean, D McKaig - Sociology of Education, 1989 - JSTOR"}, "inline_links": {"serpapi_cite_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?engine=google_scholar_cite&hl=en&q=gSDRjW54oA4J", "cited_by": {"total": 107, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=1053974729025724545&as_sdt=5,44&sciodt=0,44&hl=en", "cites_id": "1053974729025724545", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=5%2C44&cites=1053974729025724545&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}, "related_pages_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:gSDRjW54oA4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Responding+to+Differences+in+the+Classroom:+The+Politics+of+Knowledge,+Class,+and+Sexuality.+Gardner,+Saundra+And+Others+Sociology+of+Education&hl=en&as_sdt=0,44", "serpapi_related_pages_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C44&engine=google_scholar&hl=en&q=related%3AgSDRjW54oA4J%3Ascholar.google.com%2F", "versions": {"total": 4, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1053974729025724545&hl=en&as_sdt=0,44", "cluster_id": "1053974729025724545", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C44&cluster=1053974729025724545&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}}}]}
