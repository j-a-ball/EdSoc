The strategies include the use of a decomposed sample that is partitioned into groups at a particular stage who are at risk for transition into the next stage. The second strategy involves the use of a pooled sample, with step-up as the dependent variable, where a series of increasingly more complex models are run to test the notion that \u2026", "publication_info": {"summary": "DB Kandel, RZ Margulies, M Davies - Sociology of Education, 1978 - JSTOR", "authors": [{"name": "DB Kandel", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pU6PpTAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=pU6PpTAAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en", "author_id": "pU6PpTAAAAAJ"}]}, "inline_links": {"serpapi_cite_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?engine=google_scholar_cite&hl=en&q=nCSCzArjB8wJ", "cited_by": {"total": 39, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=14701969144094532764&as_sdt=5,43&sciodt=0,43&hl=en", "cites_id": "14701969144094532764", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=5%2C43&cites=14701969144094532764&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}, "related_pages_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:nCSCzArjB8wJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Analytical+Strategies+for+Studying+Transitions+into+Developmental+Stages+Kandel,+Denise+B.+And+Others+Sociology+of+Education&hl=en&as_sdt=0,43", "serpapi_related_pages_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C43&engine=google_scholar&hl=en&q=related%3AnCSCzArjB8wJ%3Ascholar.google.com%2F", "versions": {"total": 4, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14701969144094532764&hl=en&as_sdt=0,43", "cluster_id": "14701969144094532764", "serpapi_scholar_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?as_sdt=0%2C43&cluster=14701969144094532764&engine=google_scholar&hl=en"}}}]}
