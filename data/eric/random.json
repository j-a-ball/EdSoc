An empirical example involving real data was used to illustrate how the different fit statistics can be employed in conjunction with each other to identify different types of misspecifications. With these statistics and the saturated model serving as the basis, relative and absolute fit evaluation can be integrated to detect misspecification efficiently.

The data of the study were obtained from semi-structured interviews and analyzed using descriptive analysis. According to findings of the study, the social studies teachers believed that content of the social studies course was suitable for learning outside the classroom. History and geography topics, local administrations, environmental issues, cooperation, and professions were mentioned as the main subjects for learning outside the classroom. Outside learning activities were exemplified as organizing trips in and out of province, and going to the cinema, interviewing with experts and resource people, or inviting them to the school.

The experimental activities (8-12 hours) were related to the questions: (i) what does the Benedict&apos;s Reagent detect? and (ii) What is determined by glucose oxidase (GOD)? We also ask the students to compare the results with those obtained with the Lugol reagent, which detects starch. Usually, students inferred that the Benedict reagent detects reducing sugars, while GOD could be used to detect glucose. However, in GOD assay, an open question was left, because the results could be due to contamination of the sugars (particularly galactose) with glucose. Though not stressed, GOD does not oxidize the carbohydrates tested and all the positive results are due to contamination. The activities presented here can be easily done in the high school, because they are simple and non-expensive.

The problem of measuring classroom quality then emerges as a major concern. This article first considers how errors of measurement reduce statistical power in studies of the impact of interventions classroom quality. We show how to use information about reliability to compute power and plan new research. At the same time, errors of measurement introduce bias into estimates of the association between classroom quality and student outcomes. We show how to use knowledge about the magnitude of measurement error to eliminate or reduce this bias. We also briefly review research on the design of studies of the reliability of classroom measures. Such studies are essential to evaluate promising new classroom interventions.

The analysis proceeds from Michael Polanyi's concept of tacit knowledge to account for the personal dimension of professional expertise in the care sector. Results: Quantitative methods of quality assessment understand \"quality of care\" as being independent from the professional who generates it. Consequently, quality assessment as currently practiced necessarily renders the personal dimension of professional knowledge invisible, thereby excluding it from managerial attention and support. To indicate the relevance of Polanyi's concept of tacit knowledge, the paper offers some observations from the practice of care in a group home for people with intellectual disabilities.

In self-report, girls preferred humanities to science, while boys preferred science to humanities; (3) implicit affective attitude was closely related to implicit stereotype.

In Australia, professions such as pharmacy have traditionally developed experiential placement programmes within state and territory regulatory requirements and situations. The evolution of national competency and accreditation frameworks provide opportunities for collaborative approaches, including consideration of experiential placements. A research study was conducted in 2007 using Australian Government Carrick Institute funding to map experiential placements across Australian pharmacy programmes. Based on university interviews and programme mapping, consultations with over 250 participants and handbook analysis, various structures and approaches for university experiential placements were evident. In relation to learning and assessment tasks, some universities use some elements of planning process. In these, objectives are linked to pre-placement preparatory and placement learning tasks and there are opportunities for student negotiation of assessment tasks and criteria. However, in relation to assessment and explicit criteria, links to the competencies of the profession and to more generic skills were generally vague. While student evaluations of experiential placement programmes were usually evident, a systematic evaluation process involving various stakeholders including transparent processes and feedback regarding the impact on future programme planning was not present.

Design/methodology/approach: The fundamental hypothesis tested was whether the developed system effectively communicates changes in a timely manner. The level of students' acceptance to this new system was also tested. A dynamic course material change-management system was developed using visual basic programming language and an Access database. The system was applied to a hypothetical case study and to a currently running undergraduate civil engineering course. Findings: Results indicated that changes made to a course material were instantly communicated to all instructors teaching the same course. It also indicated that approved changes were instantly communicated to affected students. As a result, students were satisfied with the instant notifications they receive whenever a change takes place. Research limitations/implications: The proposed system does not include a methodology for online tests, course grades, and course assessment. The system needs to be integrated with these important features. Developments pertaining to integrating the system with these features will be considered for future investigation.

Methods: Six regular classes in 1 elementary school were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 208) or control (n = 209) group. A 13-session program was offered to students in the intervention group. The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), parent report, was used to assess problem behaviors at baseline, at the conclusion of the curriculum, and again at 6-month follow up. Results: The unadjusted mean estimates of behavioral problems were significantly lower in the intervention group posttest (at the conclusion of the curriculum), -3.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] = -6.59 to -0.48; p = 0.023) and at the 6-month follow up, -5.22 (95% CI: -8.27 to -2.16; p = 0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders, gender (female), father's educational status (high school), family relationships (good and average), and child's age in months, intervention groups (intervention posttest and intervention after 6-month follow up) showed significantly lower total behavioral scores. Conclusions: A universal school-based prevention program for Chinese elementary school-age children resulted in a significant positive change in behavioral problems. This is an important finding in the context of the Chinese 1-child policy that places great value on the achievement of the child.

However, many instructors are unsure whether or how to assimilate this technology into their lessons. The purpose of the following study was to examine the impact of unstructured (limited use) vs. structured (active use) use of laptops for 177 university students (89 males, 88 females). Both on-task (note taking, academic activities) and off-task (email, instant messaging, games, movies) behaviours were examined by surveying students. Paired-t-tests revealed that structured use of laptops resulted in significantly more time spent on note taking and academic activities and significantly less time spent on sending personal emails, instant messages and playing games during class. It is concluded that future research needs to focus on evaluating specific strategies that maximize the benefits and minimize the distractions of using laptops.

The inclusion of targeted reflective practice in academic programmes in speech-language therapy has not been consistent, although providing opportunities for speech-language therapy students to reflect during their clinical practice has been reported. Indeed, there has been limited investigation of the nature of speech-language therapy students' reflections. Aims: (1) To describe the breadth and depth of reflection skills of novice speech-language therapy students by utilizing structured reflective learning journals. (2) To evaluate the use of a coding system to determine its reliability and relevance in identifying reflection skills. Methods & Procedures: Participants were 52 students in their second year of a 4-year undergraduate speech-language therapy programme. Mean participant age was 20.5 years; all students were female. Participants completed guided written reflections following three interviews with a standardized patient (an actor portraying a parent of a child with delayed speech development). Reflections were coded by two raters. Nine participants' reflections were recoded by raters A and B to establish intra-rater reliability. Inter-rater reliability between these two raters was calculated and a third rater completed coding of 20% of students' reflections to further establish inter-rater reliability. Outcomes & Results: Results indicated that the majority of students were categorized as \"reflectors\". All students demonstrated at least one element of reflection. Their reflective writing primarily focused on a discussion of the content of and strategies used within the interviews, and reflection on and for action. Results also indicated that the coding system used within the study was reliable in determining both the breadth and depth of student reflections. Conclusions & Implications: This study found that novice speech-language therapy students can reflect on their clinical learning experiences within a structured clinical environment involving standardized patients. Only a small number of novice students were found to be critical reflectors who were able to analyse the content of clinical interviews, view the interaction from the perspective of the patient, and record changes to their own perspective which occurred as a result. The coding system was established as reliable and thus relevant for use in furthering research on reflective practice within speech-language therapy and other disciplines. Further investigation of reflective skills within other clinical environments and with additional clinical experience is recommended.

More recent research has supported the notion of &quot;mental&quot; contamination (MC) in which people feel contaminated in the absence of physical contact. The current research sought to determine whether feelings of contact contamination (CC) and MC could be induced within a non-clinical sample, whether the impact of MC and CC was comparable in terms of associated feelings and behaviour, and whether related psychopathology related to the impact of the tasks. Methods: Undergraduate students (n = 60) completed OCD relevant measures and were randomly assigned to either a CC condition (moving a bucket of fake vomit) or an MC condition (thinking about a bucket of vomit). Results: Both manipulations induced feelings of contamination. Participants in the contact condition had significantly greater urge to wash than those in the mental condition. Neutralising behaviour did not differ across conditions. Conclusions: Feelings of contamination can be induced in the absence of physical contact and for those in the MC group some aspects of OCD-relevant psychopathology were related to the impact of the manipulation. These findings have implications for the understanding and treatment of contamination-related fears in OCD.

In this article, we reflect on our attempts to do so. We focus on one aspect of instruction, the extent of cognitive demand that characterizes reading and mathematics instruction in fourth- and fifth-grade classrooms. Purpose: We pursued this work to share the difficulties faced in working across the two subject areas and how the differences and similarities in the two subject areas influenced data collection and the interpretation of results. We also wanted to explore whether the instructional styles of teachers who teach in both subject areas exhibited similar amounts of cognitive demand. Research Design: After discussing the struggles faced in data collection, terminology used, and the comparability of research bases in the two domains, we report on an exploratory analysis of classroom observation data from the High-Quality Teaching study. Three aspects of cognitive demand were assessed through the classroom observations of approximately 550 lessons in reading and 600 lessons in mathematics: demand of tasks posed by the teacher, demand of students' responses, and demand of the lesson content. Using data related to these aspects of cognitive demand, we also compared the level of cognitive demand in the reading and mathematics classes of the 69 teachers who taught both subjects. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the level of cognitive demand exhibited in the tasks teachers pose and the responses and work of students are similar in mathematics and reading. However, we found that the cognitive demand associated with content was higher in reading than in mathematics. For teachers who teach both reading and mathematics, only a small percent demonstrated the same demanding instruction for tasks, responses, or content regardless of subject area. Are the differences real, or an artifact of the definitions and protocols used to compare the subject areas? In either case, we raise issues related to teacher education, professional development, and evaluation. Should teacher policies incorporate information about potential differences in quality instruction across disciplines, and, if so, how? If quality instruction across subjects differs, what are implications for policies that shape expectations for teachers who teach both reading and mathematics?", "subject": ["Observation", "Mathematics Instruction", "Grade 5", "Instructional Effectiveness", "Grade 4", "Reading Instruction", "Elementary School Teachers", "Cognitive Processes", "Teaching Styles"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Research"], "publicationdateyear": 2012, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["ISSN-1467-9620"], "publisher": "Teachers College, Columbia University.

Thus, our tones have an abstract timbre that resists verbal labeling, they differ across trials so that no \"standard\" comparison stimulus is built up, and the spectral change to be discriminated is very slight and therefore does not shift stimuli across verbal categories. Nonetheless, performance in this nonverbal immediate memory task was better at short (1-, 2-, or 4-s) than long (8-, 16-, or 32-s) RIs, an outcome predicted by temporal distinctiveness theory whereby at long RIs, tones are closer in time to tones on previous trials. We reject this account in the 2nd experiment, where we demonstrate that the ratio of RI to intertrial interval makes absolutely no difference to performance. We suggest that steady forgetting is consistent with a psychoacoustically derived conception of an auditory memory (the \"timbre memory model\") that embodies time-based forgetting in the absence of feature-specific interference.

Regardless of class, race, and gender, it is no longer enough for a growing number of individuals simply to attend college: matriculating at an institution of unmistakable quality is the over arching concern. In response to this concern, and in the absence of more concrete indicators, a body of folklore or conventional wisdom has evolved about how to identify \"quality\" colleges. This folklore has been shaped by many sources: the lay public, the media, counselors and college admission personnel, college and university faculty, and leading graduate schools. The folklore about institutional quality has assuaged the need for understanding in the absence of more authoritative information. Yet, a growing body of scholarship and research on college quality, much of it published in the past 10 years, raises some serious questions about the adequacy of conventional wisdom.

A series of four multiple regressions was conducted to determine whether social integration, academic integration, institutional satisfaction, and homesick-related distress could be predicted using variables in Tinto's (1993) model.

Its relatively insignificant contribution to Hall's treatise (Arnett, 2006), the early demise of its recapitulation theory underpinnings, and the later opposition of many researchers notwithstanding, it survives a century of academic challenge to remain, in Robert Epstein's words, \"a life-size, three-dimensional, rock-solid image of Teen in Turmoil.\" In this essay, the author considers the concurrent emergence of a new generic metaphor for the adolescent condition and suggests that, given the familiar notions of a poorly controlled (or even totally out-of-control) state of being it invokes, its endorsement by \"teen brain\" supporters seriously compromises assertions of even-handed promotion of adolescents' strengths and weaknesses. Of course the riposte to this might be that metaphors matter much less than \"hard facts,\" and such imagery should be seen merely as helpful (even mildly humorous) conceptual shorthand for complex science. Do a few \"mere words,\" therefore, truly warrant special attention?

The paper offers a case study of the teaching of a traditionally-taught abstract algebra course, including showing the range of practice as larger than previously described in research literature. This study describes the aspects of proof writing and modes of thought the instructor modeled for the students. The study finds that she frequently modeled the aspects of hierarchical structure and formal-rhetorical skills, and structural, critical, and instantiation modes of thought. This study also examines the instructor's attempts to involve the students in the proof writing process during class by asking questions and expecting responses. Finally, the study describes how those questions and responses were part of her proof presentation. The funneling pattern of Steinbring (1989) describes most of the question and answer discussions enacted in the class with most questions requiring a factual response.

Results of the study indicate that engineering professional development tends to be based on work focused on curriculum development and implementation. Given the distinct design orientation of engineering, it is not surprising that the focus of engineering-oriented professional development tends to concentrate on engaging activities, with a primary focus on process rather than content. A key outcome of this study was an observed lack of a clearly formulated and articulated conceptual foundation for secondary level engineering. Regarding pedagogy, the researchers identified a heavy emphasis on modeling and applied learning. At the same time, the researchers observed a lack of emphasis on reflection and analysis of the pedagogical processes and techniques used to shape teachers' ability to teach engineering to their students.

Design/methodology/approach: Previous research is used to develop a conceptual frame of reference, which is further developed through a longitudinal qualitative case study of five new venture teams. Conceptualising these teams' learning as sequences of events over a one-year period provides rich insight from real-life processes. Findings: A conceptual model of how entrepreneurial learning may be understood as an effectual process is presented. The interactions and interdependencies between nine process characteristics along three main dimensions in the process, activity, multiple actors and context-dependent, demonstrate how the process tie together as a whole. Research limitations/implications: The present paper argues for further cross-fertilisation of entrepreneurial learning and effectuation research and showcases how studies of entrepreneurial learning may contribute to organisational learning in entrepreneurial ventures. The conceptualisation of characteristics and dimensions aims to support future process studies by suggesting a framework for analysing process events in longitudinal studies. Originality/value: Previous research has already established how activities are central to entrepreneurial learning and emphasised that what constitutes the two dimensions of multiple actors and context-dependence is important. The present paper contributes to entrepreneurial learning with an enhanced understanding of why and how the three dimensions are important as well as interdependent and mutually interactive. The present paper also contributes to organisational learning by extending the understanding of learning in emerging entrepreneurial organisations.", "subject": ["Entrepreneurship", "Context Effect", "Learning Processes", "Case Studies", "Correlation", "Workplace Learning"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Research"], "publicationdateyear": 2019, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["ISSN-0969-6474"], "publisher": "Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In the U.S., the federal Head Start program and state-funded public school-based pre-kindergarten (pre-k) programs are the two primary center-based settings in which low-income children experience publicly funded preschool. Although evidence suggests that these programs generally promote cognitive and social-emotional skills for low-income children overall, whether the benefits of program participation vary for low-income children with difficult temperaments is unexplored. Difficult temperament status is a source of vulnerability that connotes increased risk for poor early school outcomes--risks that may be ameliorated by public preschool programs known to promote kindergarten readiness among other vulnerable populations. Using a nationally representative sample of low-income children (N \u02dc 3,000) drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -- Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), this study tests whether associations between public preschool participation and children's cognitive and social-emotional skills in kindergarten are moderated by difficult temperament status. We focus on Head Start and public school-based pre-k, comparing both with parental care and with each other. Results provide weak evidence that public preschool's benefits on children's cognitive and social-emotional skills in kindergarten are moderated by child temperament. School-based pre-k is significantly associated with better reading skills relative to parental care only for children with difficult temperaments. Additionally, for children with difficult temperaments, Head Start is significantly associated with better approaches to learning relative to parental care, and with reduced externalizing behavior problems relative to school-based pre-k.", "subject": ["Low Income", "School Readiness", "Preschool Children", "Disadvantaged Youth", "Personality Traits", "Correlation", "Preschool Education", "Risk", "Social Development", "Emotional Development", "Cognitive Development", "Kindergarten", "Children", "Longitudinal Studies", "Surveys", "Comparative Analysis", "Family Environment", "Child Care", "Learning Processes", "Behavior Problems", "Child Behavior", "Educational Experience"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Research"], "publicationdateyear": 2019, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["ISSN-0012-1649"], "publisher": "American Psychological Association.

Results indicated that most teachers referred in some way to the fixed structure of the unit of repeat and to the notion of repetition, but without focusing on the length of the unit of repeat and the number of times it is repeated.

Qualitative research took place with farmers at a local farmer's market in the Midwest and with residents living in food desert neighborhood who benefited from the gleaned produce. Quantitative data was gathered through online surveys. Participants included the farmers who donated produce, the volunteers who gleaned from farmers and distributed to the community residents, and the community residents who picked up the produce. Farmers, volunteers, and residents all supported the gleaning program as a beneficial way to provide fresh produce to low income residents. The program assisted in the utilization of excess produce that would have otherwise been thrown out, thus cutting down on food waste.

Anxiety also decreases chances for fluency development, as learners are less willing to produce output (Gregersen &amp; MacIntyre, 2014), consequently hindering language development (Swain, 2000). One way of minimizing the impact of these limitations is to motivate students to speak intelligibly and fluently, preferably beyond the constraints of the language classroom. In this study, we investigated the pedagogical use of Spaceteam ESL, a mobile game that requires intelligible and fluent computer-mediated oral exchanges among players. Participants (N = 20) were low-intermediate English as a second language (ESL) students divided into two groups: the treatment group, which played Spaceteam ESL as a 15-minute warm-up activity for six weeks, and the control group, which engaged in comparable non-gaming activities. Pre-tests, post-tests, and delayed post-tests measured changes in oral fluency (i.e., syllables produced per minute and judges' ratings) and interviews addressed factors related to anxiety and willingness to communicate (WTC).

Feminist influence of the literature mainly comes from Marxist, anti-racist, Black, and post-colonial feminist theories. Meanwhile, adult learning theories, particularly transformative learning, informal learning, and socio-cultural learning, and the adult education orientations for empowerment and social action have also expanded the scholarship of gender, women, and immigrant studies.

We found that the curricular nationalism within multicultural education courses often negates any critical engagement with the influence of transnationalism on immigrants and their educational experiences. Transnational migrants are expected to translate their experiences, cultural practices, and life ways to fit into the container of the U.S. nation-state.

This paper reports the results of interviews with higher education teachers in China working in conventional, campus-based universities, concerning their conceptions and beliefs of e-learning. The interviews were analysed from a grounded theory perspective that gave rise to seven emerging themes, namely: the 'centrality of the lecture', 'online cooperative learning', 'network learning', 'student learning', 'lecture plus online work', 'infrastructure and access' and 'professional development'. Discussion of these emerging themes helps us understand the ways in which these teachers think about e-learning and teaching, the beliefs they hold about their 'e' practice, the ways in which they implement e-learning, the problems they face in incorporating e-learning into their courses and the ways in which they perceive e-learners. This provides a fascinating and unique insight into e-learning in Chinese higher education. Evidence shows that it is a complex area with many influences, some of which can be attributed to social, cultural and Confucian-heritage factors.

If placement also fails to lead to educational benefits, the practice becomes even more suspect. Some studies have explored disproportionate placement (i.e., overrepresentation) from the perspectives of policy makers and educators, but few have looked at the practice from the vantage of the African American students experiencing it. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study explored how nine African American students in secondary special education placements perceived their school experiences and the benefits, challenges, and detriments associated with their placements and accompanying disability labels. Setting: Participating students attended one of three high schools in an urban district in the midwestern United States. Respectively, the schools had low, medium, and high percentages of students on individualized education programs (IEPs). Population/Participants/Subjects: Three students from each of three schools participated in the study. With the help of school personnel, the researchers selected students who (a) were African American, (b) were juniors or seniors, (c) carried the label of learning disabilities or mild cognitive impairment, and (d) had received special education services for at least three years. Research Design: The researchers used an in-depth interview design including three increasingly detailed interviews with each student. Verbatim transcripts of interviews provided the data the researchers analyzed using (a) inductive coding, (b) development of case-specific profiles, (c) organization of codes to identify patterns in the data, and (d) identification of emergent themes. Findings/Results: Three emergent themes suggested that, in most cases, students found the negative consequences of their special education placement to outweigh any benefits. The limited benefits of placement included interactions with responsive teachers and, in a few cases, more suitable instructional pacing. The negative consequences included the experience of being stigmatized by peers, making limited academic progress because of a slow-paced curriculum, and confronting barriers that kept them from returning to general education placements. Conclusions/Recommendations: The study found that traumatic events in the students' lives led to academic difficulties, which subsequently led to placement in special education. Rather than supporting the students through a difficult phase of their lives, educators used special education referral and placement as a form of victim blaming. This response had the effect of excluding the students from engagement with the general education curriculum and from interaction with friends. The dynamics of victim blaming led the researchers to judge special education referral and placement of the nine African American students as a form of institutional racism.", "subject": ["Student Experience", "African American Students", "Special Education", "Disproportionate Representation", "Student Placement", "Student Attitudes", "Student Satisfaction", "Interviews", "Teacher Student Relationship", "Attitudes toward Disabilities", "Peer Relationship", "Barriers", "High School Students"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Research"], "publicationdateyear": 2018, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["ISSN-0161-4681"], "publisher": "Teachers College, Columbia University.

The author also aims to identify important gaps in what is still to be discovered about organizations that learn, partly to single out promising areas to be investigated. Design/Methodology/Approach: The author reviews all the previously published articles in the first 20 volumes printed and reviews each issue in each volume. The author classifies the methodology undertaken by each published article as being one of the following: a conceptual study, a case study or the analysis of other data. Keywords are assessed to get insights into the shifts in research themes pursued over the years. Findings: There has been a substantial increase in the number of published papers over time. The number and percentage of articles that are conceptual in nature has declined somewhat over the years. The number and percentage of articles that involve case studies has increased over the years. The number and percentage of articles that involve analyzing data has increased significantly over the years. There has been a significant shift in research focus away from topics such as management and organizational development to topics such as knowledge management and social networks. Three major areas of gaps in our knowledge of learning organizations are identified: what it means to be a learning organization, how effective are learning organizations and what contextual factors influence learning organizations. Research Limitations/Implications: Although other journals occasionally publish research on learning organizations, attention in this paper is solely focused upon &quot;TLO.&quot; Practical Implications: Addressing some of the research questions identified should provide insights that will assist practicing managers. Originality/Value: Although not a meta analysis of this journal's research, the author presents a &quot;thematic analysis&quot; of research published in this journal, and the results and insights should prove interesting and useful to scholars in the field seeking rich areas to study.", "subject": ["Organizational Culture", "Lifelong Learning", "Periodicals", "Journal Articles", "Content Analysis", "State of the Art Reviews", "Case Studies", "Data Analysis", "Educational Research", "Scholarship", "Productivity", "Trend Analysis", "Administration", "Organizational Development", "Knowledge Management", "Social Networks", "Research Problems", "Research Methodology", "Qualitative Research"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Research", "Information Analyses"], "publicationdateyear": 2016, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["ISSN-0969-6474"], "publisher": "Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

These problems can severely affect the individual's evaluation of the quality of life. In this study we assessed several predictors of life satisfaction. Undergraduate students enrolled at Marshall University participated in the study (n = 149). Participants filled out several questionnaires (Self-monitoring, Revised Life Orientation Test, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, and Satisfaction with Life Scale) during one session that lasted between 30-45 minutes. Alternative hierarchical models of life satisfaction were tested including the following predictors: dispositional variables (optimism and self-monitoring), perceived stress and anxiety, social support from three different sources (family, friends, significant others), and gender. Results indicated that life satisfaction was high (80% of the subjects reported to be satisfied above average), a figure comparable to the national average. Dispositional variables played an opposite role: whereas high optimism had a very significant impact on life satisfaction, excessive self-monitoring was related to lower levels of life satisfaction. Social support, in particular family support, played a moderating role in reducing the level of perceived anxiety and thus increasing life satisfaction. In conclusion, these results indicated that different sources of stress drive distinct coping mechanisms in different physical and socio-cultural environments, and a combination of high optimism and family support is critical to help reducing anxiety in an environment characterized by poverty, social and gender disparity, and high suicide rate.", "subject": ["Life Satisfaction", "Predictor Variables", "Undergraduate Students", "Rural Areas", "Questionnaires", "Likert Scales", "Psychological Patterns", "Stress Variables", "Self Evaluation (Individuals)", "Personality Traits", "Anxiety", "Social Support Groups", "Gender Differences", "Positive Attitudes", "Family Involvement", "Coping", "Poverty Areas", "Multiple Regression Analysis", "Statistical Analysis"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Research"], "publicationdateyear": 2009, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["ISSN-0973-8827"], "publisher": "i-manager Publications. 3-343 Hill View, Town Railway Nagar, Nagercoil 629001, Tamil Nadu, India.

The author has adopted 6 objectives in his plan for survey design, the last being to induce students into an authentic seminar--i.e. into a cohesive, cooperative, and authentic conversation by means of which they would question, interpret, criticize, and collectively, with the professors guidance, teach each other about literature and literary history. The attempt to achieve this last objective is the subject of this article. The author has variously discovered, borrowed, and adapted a number of assignments that help to create an effective seminar. These include the formal presentation paper, judiciously timed secondary readings characterized by students, prompted journals, and timely assessments through questionnaires and conferences, which are described in this article.", "subject": ["Introductory Courses", "Curriculum Design", "College Curriculum", "Seminars", "English Literature", "Assignments", "Reading Materials", "Student Journals", "Teacher Student Relationship", "Conferences (Gatherings)", "Student Evaluation"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Descriptive"], "publicationdateyear": 2007, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["ISSN-0007-8034"], "publisher": "College English Association.

Promoting physical activity may be a viable population-level approach to improving cardiovascular health among smokers. Purpose: To characterize smokers engaging in any physical activity based on demographics, quitting behaviors, health perceptions, preventive health behaviors, and disease status to identify targets for subsequent intervention. Methods: A national sample of smokers participating in the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 4 Cycle 2 data collection (N\u00a0=\u00a0491) was analyzed using bivariate and multivariate regression models to characterize smokers engaging in any physical activity. Results: Some past-week physical activity was reported by 62% of smokers. &quot;Active&quot; status was associated with being younger (Exp(B)\u00a0=\u00a00.971; P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001), lower body mass index (Exp(B)\u00a0=\u00a00.955; P\u00a0=\u00a00.011), fewer hours of daily screen time (Exp(B)\u00a0=\u00a00.903; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), consuming at least one cup of fruit and vegetables daily (Exp(B)\u00a0=\u00a01.971; P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), and non-consideration of a quit attempt (Exp(B)\u00a0=\u00a00.606; P\u00a0=\u00a00.021). Discussion: Smokers participating in any physical activity also demonstrated a more healthful cardiovascular risk profile, suggesting that promoting physical activity in completely inactive smokers could improve overall cardiovascular health.

Within U.S. business schools today, there is little debate over the need for MIS courses and the topics addressed therein. On the other hand, those who teach information management continue to face challenges in connecting their sometimes highly-technical subject matter to the rest of the business school curriculum and more importantly in winning over their students to the fact that MIS plays a central role in the successful operations and competitive standing of all organizations. This lack of connection manifests itself very clearly in the serious drop witnessed over recent years in business school student interest in MIS as a major area of study and as a post-graduation career option. The purpose of this article is to present a framework for thinking about and teaching MIS that in the view of the authors better integrates the learnings of a MIS offering with the rest of the business school curriculum. The framework includes business needs, information requirements, and information systems elements. The objectives of this framework are three fold: (1) to more accurately relate the processes and technologies of information management to the operational, managerial, and strategic needs of the enterprise; (2) to provide the student with a lens through which to better appreciate the connections between the effective deployment and use of MIS and the realization of the organization's goals and objectives; and (3) to better enable the team of instructors who typically teach these courses within a business school program to provide a uniform and substantive MIS learning experience for their students while at the same time allowing individual instructors flexibility in their coverage of course materials. To these ends, the authors provide a historical context for the creation of their integrative learning and teaching model, an explication of the model itself, and then several illustrations of the application of this model in the teaching of representative business cases.

Although international experience is often considered as important, many students at German universities do not even consider abroad. Referring to the Theory of Rational Choice (RCT) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the intention to study abroad is shaped by student's evaluation of expected benefits from studying abroad, resources and restrictions regarding its realization, and normative aspects. In a factorial survey experiment, hypothetical study abroad descriptions with varying attributes were presented to students of economics and engineering of a German university. The experimental design allows for more nuanced operationalizations and for diminished endogeneity biases through systematic variation and randomization. Thus, a more direct test of the assumptions about educational decision-making is possible. A comparison of the unbiased predictor weights clearly indicates that students prioritize conditions when considering study abroad. They seem to not ponder about beneficial outcomes of studying abroad, such as own personality development and being in a desired host country, as long as the realization of the stay is not substantially guaranteed by related foreign language skills, sufficient financing, and a supportive host university.

A host of various graduate teacher training programmes have been developed, implemented and evaluated accordingly in order to enhance their teaching capability. In addition research has also documented the varied or sometimes complex factors that influence graduate students' teaching capability. This present study set out to explore graduate students' sense of psychological empowerment as an influencing factor on their perceived teaching self-image and behaviours. The Teaching as a Chemistry Laboratory Graduate Teaching Assistant (TCL-GTA) programme was developed to enhance the sense of psychological empowerment experienced by seven chemistry graduate students at an Irish University as a means of enhancing their perceived teaching self-image and behaviours.

Thus, researchers in the fields of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and second language acquisition (SLA) would profit from considering multilingualism and social justice when envisioning new CALL-SLA interfaces for the future. I first explain the connection I see among multilingualism, digital literacy, and social justice, and I characterize contemporary SLA as transformed by a social turn that is now complete, a bilingual turn slowly underway, and a social justice turn emerging on the horizon. I then review empirical evidence that suggests digital communication encourages multilingual practices, helps users appreciate the open nature of language resources, and perhaps even supports positive multilingual ideologies. Next I offer some illustrations of possible new research questions and CALL-SLA studies that would focus on embracing and exploiting the openness of language resources in language learning, and on doing multilingual learning. Finally, I examine what we know about the digital divide that is relevant to CALL-SLA researchers.

A qualitative case study was conducted using the theory of boundary crossing to make sense of the ways collaboration took place within the project team. The main theme, also a major dilemma in the project, referred to the transition from a democratic towards a more directive approach within the project design after the first year. The members of the project team took shifting and ambivalent positions within the project as they were trying to cross boundaries between the different goals of the project. Also, boundary objects on different levels contributed to the collaboration. We conclude that clear boundaries between groups or a strong shared identity, as proposed by an insider--outsider model of action research and the notion of first-order democracy, are not helpful in complex collaborative action research projects. Instead, we need the development of second-order democracy means in order to cross boundaries and sustain a critical dialogue about differences.", "subject": ["Participatory Research", "Action Research", "College Faculty", "Elementary School Teachers", "Case Studies", "College School Cooperation", "Teamwork", "Role", "Models", "Democracy", "Qualitative Research", "Interviews", "Elementary Schools", "Secondary Schools", "Observation"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Research"], "publicationdateyear": 2017, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["ISSN-0965-0792"], "publisher": "Routledge.

Affective Learning from a Cognitive Neuroscientific Perspective", "author": ["Mottet, Timothy P."], "description": "The mission of &quot;Communication Education&quot; is to publish the best research on communication and learning. Researchers study the communication-learning interface in many ways, but a common approach is to explore how instructor and student communication can lead to better learning outcomes. Although scholars have long classified learning into three domains--cognitive, affective, and behavioral--it is not often that behavioral learning is investigated in instructional communication research. Thus, the focus of most of the research in instructional communication is on cognitive and affective learning. This forum explores the study of affective learning by addressing two critical questions that define the field's exploration of the topic: (1) What is affective learning?; and (2) How should we measure affective learning in instructional communication research? This forum initiates conversation on this topic. The essay presented is one of seven in this forum on the topic of affective learning. With the increasing interest in how emotions and learning are interrelated and the volumes of new research being generated from the fields of affective science and cognitive neuroscience, it is time for instructional communication researchers to again revisit the construct and measurement of affective learning. After reading and reflecting on the essays that are a part of this special forum on affective learning, the author was reminded of how important the work of Benjamin Bloom, David Krathwohl, and Bertram Masia has been on how to think about, study, and measure affective learning. In response to these essays, the author would like to raise an issue that was largely missing from the discussion, and which needs to be part of this conversation--whether people have become too dependent on this body of work as the foundation for this particular construct in the 21st century. Learning, whether cognitive, behavioral, or affective, begins as a function of cognition and brain processing. The author would encourage researchers interested in refining the conceptualization and operationalization of affective learning to complement Bloom and his colleagues work with new theory and research from the field of cognitive neuroscience.

Slovaks who sought to learn English at the turn of the millennium were driven by the brand new anxiety of job insecurity. English lessons at this time sold themselves as the pathway to upward mobility, teaching Slovaks not only phrases of speech, but also the rudiments of capitalism: how to shop, how to drive, and especially, how to learn ever more English to keep your job. Although domestically produced textbooks taught these lessons with subtle notes of ambivalence, those textbooks imported from Anglophone countries modeled an unabashed embrace of capitalism. It was most often ambivalence that was echoed by the Slovaks interviewed for this study, however, who were mindful that their pursuit of English thrust them into a race against peers both at home and abroad. These years reveal this paradox of English in the new capitalist world: offering the path to betterment it had become the idiom for the anxiety of falling behind.

Design/methodology/approach: A range of published works (1976-2005) in both the fields of industrial quality and quality and assessment in higher education are reviewed and arranged contextually so as to tell a collective \"story\" about their origins, similarities, and differences. This general review provides the reader with a structured historical examination of these concepts with practical emphasis on potential lessons learned. Findings: Provides information on the major quality theorists and relates the types of quality (as defined in industrial terms) to the enterprise of higher education. Even more important, quality and assessment are defined within the context of US higher education. Though the terms are debatable, what is certain is that increased competitive pressure, finite individual and institutional resources, and increased demand for universal access, have made assessing the quality of higher education a major public, private, and international concern. Originality/value: The value of this paper lies in its simple, yet comprehensive treatment of the subject-matter. There is an information gap between industry and higher education and, as such, many lessons are lost. With an increasingly turbulent higher education environment, academic leaders and faculty, regardless of nationality, should consider the collective context of quality and assessment as more than an account of things past or present, but as a guide to planning, leading, and ultimately assessing future calls for reform.", "subject": ["Higher Education", "Educational Quality", "Quality Control", "Industry", "History", "Evaluation Methods", "Futures (of Society)", "Educational Change", "College Faculty", "Administrators"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Research"], "publicationdateyear": 2006, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["ISSN-0968-4883"], "publisher": "Emerald. 875 Massachusetts Avenue 7th Floor, Cambridge, MA 02139.

This raises the possibility that parental knowledge is spuriously correlated with youth delinquency solely because the most delinquent youth disclose the least information to parents (because they have the most to hide). We tested this spurious association hypothesis using prospective data on offspring of a nationally representative sample of US women, controlling demographic and contextual covariates. In separate analyses, greater parental knowledge of their offspring's peer associations at both 12-13 years and at 14-15 years was associated with lower odds of being in the top 1 standard deviation of youth-reported delinquency at 16-17 years, controlling for delinquency at the earlier ages. The extent to which parents set limits on activities with peers at 14-15 years did not mediate or moderate the association between parental knowledge and delinquency, but it did independently predict future delinquency among adolescents living in high-risk neighborhoods. This suggests that the association between parental knowledge and future delinquency is not solely spurious; rather parental knowledge and limit setting are both meaningful predictors of future delinquency.", "subject": ["Parent Child Relationship", "Adolescents", "Delinquency", "Knowledge Level", "Mothers", "Parenting Styles", "Peer Relationship", "Self Disclosure (Individuals)", "Disadvantaged Environment", "Neighborhoods"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Evaluative"], "publicationdateyear": 2008, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["ISSN-0091-0627"], "publisher": "Springer. 233 Spring Street, New York, NY 10013.

Correction is \"an understanding-display device\" by which participants in interaction can check and correct problems occurring in activity. The socio-cultural understanding of learning as changing participation is the point of departure. The data material consists of longitudinal video recordings from naturally occurring physiotherapist-patient encounters focussing the interplay between talk, gaze, gesture, body orientation, and artefacts. Through an integrated interactional exploration of smaller alternating cycles of changes from \"other\" to \"self\" regarding who is responsible for detecting and solving problems, the findings show how a learner's capability to notice similarities and differences develops in progressive situations. The analysis contributes empirically to expanding the understanding of some generative aspects of learning related to the issue of transfer in educational science.

This model is then applied to the energy loss mechanism in the capacitor charging problem or the two-capacitor problem. This approach allows a simple explanation of the energy dissipation mechanism in these problems and shows that the dissipated energy should always be \"exactly half\" the supplied energy whether that is caused by the Joule heat or by the radiation.

In this article, the authors focus on one high-stakes preservice teacher performance assessment designed to meet these guidelines. The Performance Assessment for California Teachers (PACT), currently used in 32 teacher preparation programs throughout California, is a comprehensive assessment of knowledge and skills in which candidates analyze and reflect on their own instruction and their students' learning during a &quot;Teaching Event&quot; in their student teaching placements. The authors document how eight elementary teacher candidates from teacher preparation programs throughout California discussed issues related to language and learning for ELs in their extensive written materials about their teaching and their students' learning submitted as part of their PACT Teaching Events. While candidates for elementary credentials can choose to complete a mathematics or a language arts/literacy Teaching Event, the authors focused on those candidates who chose mathematics. The authors focus on mathematics because it is often misunderstood to be a language-free endeavor and because it represents an area in which schools have failed many ELs and other students from non-dominant linguistic backgrounds. The authors argue that the PACT, beyond its function as a high stakes examination used for state licensing decisions, has the potential to provide important information that can serve as formative assessment and feedback for teacher candidates themselves, individual teacher educators, and teacher education programs as a whole.

Design: Cross-sectional investigation of children, 2 to 12 years, attending a well visit. Setting: Pediatric private practice/ambulatory pediatric clinic. Participants: One hundred seventy-four children: 49% preschool-aged, 54% female, 28% Hispanic, and 34% overweight or at risk for overweight. Variables Measured: Parent-reported eating/leisure-time behaviors. Height/weight from medical records. Analysis: Analyses of covariance/chi-square tests; significance at P less than or equal to 0.05. Results: By parents' report, preschool-aged children consumed more servings/day of low-fat dairy (2.1 +/- 1.6 vs 1.7 +/- 1.5; P less than 0.01), fewer servings/day of sweetened drinks (1.4 +/- 1.9 vs 2.2 +/- 2.6; P less than 0.01) and watched fewer hours/day of weekend TV (2.3 +/- 1. 3 vs 2.7 +/- 1.3; P less than 0.05) than school-aged children. Fewer preschool-aged children consumed salty (14.0% vs 26.1%; P less than 0.05) and sweet (16.3% vs. 29.5%; P less than 0.05) snack food daily, and a greater percentage regularly consumed dinner with a parent (93.0% vs 80.7%; P less than 0.05), as assessed by parent report. Conclusions and Implications: Parent-reported children's eating/leisure-time patterns that may influence energy balance were less healthful in the school-aged children. However, most children did not meet recommendations, irrespective of age or weight. Interventions for meeting recommendations should start with families with preschool-aged children. Future research should focus on identifying factors that might be contributing to increased reporting of problematic food and leisure-time activity patterns in school-aged children.

One way to correct this situation is to include specific content about bullying within their initial university curriculum. We present a study that shows how a specific course on bullying affects trainee teachers' knowledge, perceptions and attitudes towards this problem. Method: The participants (n = 199) are trainee teachers (university students) of Pre-School, Elementary and Secondary Education, distributed between an experimental and a control group. The &quot;School Bullying Questionnaire&quot; (Nicolaides, Toda &amp; Smith, 2002) was adapted to Spanish for this research, and used for data collection. A quasi-experimental pre-post design with non-equivalent groups is used. Results: The results indicate statistically significant improvement among members of the experimental group in terms of characterizing the phenomenon, detecting the agents involved, characterizing victims and aggressors, choosing strategies to deal with bullying, as well as improvement in perceived self-efficacy for confronting the problem effectively. Discussion and conclusions: Results allow us to affirm that members of the experimental group have modified and improved their knowledge and perceptions about bullying, as has been seen in other studies. Specific training has a positive impact and makes clear the need to include specific content about school-related problems in the pre-service teachers' curriculum.

It has permeated virtually all sectors and the education sector has been particularly affected. The argument of this paper is that most of the literature and discussion about this issue is couched in terms of some fairly simple polarities: managers versus leaders, transactional versus transformational leaders, task-focused versus people-focused and so on. Moreover, recent analysis in education has begun to question the predominant focus on the head teacher as the leader but, so far, there has been little empirical work carried out on the meanings and implications of distributed leadership. The research reported here suggests that one crucial issue to be addressed is the dynamic of competition between leaders. Using a new conceptual framework, this article reports on a case study that reveals different interpretations of what leadership should entail and constitute at different levels of the organization. The paper shows that it is by no means enough to proselytize 'leadership' as if this will produce a set of approaches and behaviours that will unproblematically transform.

Ninety-eight middle school students completed measures of stressful life events, cognition (cognitive triad and locus of control), and depressive symptoms. Results provided support for both mediating and moderating models of depression. Specifically, the cognitive triad mediated the relationship between stressful life events and depressive symptom categories of negative mood, ineffectiveness, and anhedonia, while it interacted with stressful life events to predict negative self-esteem. In addition, locus of control was found to interact with stressful life events to predict anhedonia. Finally, the diathesis-stress model was not supported when predicting the CDI Interpersonal Problems factor score, which taps externalizing behaviors. Implications for school psychology research and practice include the importance of including measures of stressful life events and cognitive styles in assessment of children's social-emotional functioning.

The estimated effects of additional maternal schooling for children of these younger mothers appear to be more pronounced for children's reading than math skills.", "subject": ["Mothers", "Educational Attainment", "Mathematics Skills", "Parent Influence", "Academic Achievement", "Correlation", "Family Environment", "Age Differences", "Reading Skills", "Achievement Gains"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Research"], "publicationdateyear": 2007, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["ISSN-0012-1649"], "publisher": "American Psychological Association.

We make the following specific suggestions: The optionality in RI reflects the presence of a grammar such as Chinese which does not manifest tense marking. The gradual elimination of the nontense-marking grammar is facilitated by the learning of the morphosyntactic system of the target language. Quantitative differences in the input data among morphosyntactic systems result in the cross-linguistic variation in the RI phenomenon. More broadly, we aim to demonstrate that quantitative aspects of language learning data and concrete mechanisms of the language learning process can play an important role in the generative approach to language acquisition. In Section 2, we give a brief overview of the RI literature along with some methodological remarks regarding the explanation of the phenomenon. In Section 3, we lay out our theory of morphosyntactic learning and the broader variational approach to language acquisition. Our empirical work focuses on the development of tense in Spanish, French, and English. In Section 4 we show through corpus study of child-directed speech that differences in the morphosyntactic systems of these three languages explain the brief RI stage in Spanish acquisition, the prolonged RI stage in English acquisition, as well the intermediate status of the RI stage in French. In Section 5, we discuss how our approach relates to various findings established in the previous literature on RI. Section 6 concludes with a general discussion of the proper role of the input data in theories of language acquisition.", "subject": ["Linguistic Theory", "French", "Child Language", "Language Acquisition", "Morphology (Languages)", "Syntax", "Grammar", "Morphemes", "Spanish", "English", "Interaction"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Research"], "publicationdateyear": 2007, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["ISSN-1048-9223"], "publisher": "Lawrence Erlbaum.

Given that these populations often have overlapping clinical needs and are likely to receive services in similar settings, efforts to integrate the knowledge gained in the disparate literature may be beneficial. This article provides a systematic overview of the current (1995-2005) empirical research on PT/PE for children with DBD and ASD; attending to factors for cross-fertilization. Twenty-two ASD and 38 DBD studies were coded for review. Literature was compared in three main areas: (1) research methodology, (2) focus of PT/PE intervention, and (3) PT/PE procedures. There was no overlap in publication outlets between the studies for the two populations. Results indicate that there are opportunities for cross-fertilization in the areas of (1) research methodology, (2) intervention targets, and (3) format of parenting interventions.

In this article, we illustrate this process through a school-based example. This example is drawn from a larger project in which area regional school-district consultants and university researchers partnered with four elementary schools in an effort to enhance each school's capacity to implement evidence-based practice and decisions at primary (i.e., universal or school-wide), secondary (i.e., targeted efforts for selected groups of students and/or settings), and tertiary (i.e., individual-student) levels to promote behavioral competence. The project incorporated promising strategies and tools designed to promote and sustain the use of evidence-based practices and data-driven problem solving. Continuous progress monitoring of systemic variables and student behavioral outcomes (e.g., office-referral data) helped to guide systemic reform efforts. Reductions were noted in the number of student discipline problems, and improvements were noted in critical features of school-wide effective behavior support at a systems level.

For most people outside the field, writing is viewed as a set of skills, rather than a substantive area of study. If students would only learn the rules--and if composition teachers would only teach those rules--then students would write better (and be less burdensome to people in other fields). This is the perspective that typically informs the first-year writing requirement at most schools. For people inside composition, it is this institutional agenda and obligation that clouds their sense of the subject matter \"as a subject matter\" and promotes the idea that there is a split between theory and practice in the field. In this article, the aspect the author wishes to highlight is simply this: at the exact moment that disciplined knowledge making was introduced as a primary function of higher education, composition was created as a wholly nondisciplinary course. Born of a test, college composition was always imagined as preparatory to disciplinary work, but not itself amenable to disciplined inquiry. The corollary to this, of course, is that students became, in lieu of a disciplinary subject, the de facto subject(s) of scrutiny. This historical construction has left the composition professional largely unprotected by the tenets of academic freedom. Students deserve more than skills training; they deserve an education, and teachers deserve the right to teach them.

Participants: Undergraduate students (N = 380) completed questionnaires at 2 time points during their freshman year. Methods: In the middle of the academic year (T1), students estimated their risk of engaging in unplanned sex and reported their alcohol use during the previous term. Four months later (T2), they again reported alcohol use and indicated whether they had engaged in unplanned sex since T1. Results: Students who consumed more alcohol at T1 rated their risk of unplanned sex more highly, suggesting relative accuracy. Those with higher risk perceptions consumed more alcohol at T2 (controlling for T1 use), suggesting that they maintained the high-risk behavior. Last, those who were unrealistically optimistic (i.e., estimated low risk at T1 yet had unplanned sex by T2) reported greater alcohol use at T2. Conclusions: These findings highlight the role that risk perceptions regarding sexual activity may play in college students' alcohol use.

The oldest adolescents worry most about their appearance, being overweight, their friends, and problems at home. Adolescents who prefer talking to parents when worried are less likely to worry about being liked, while those who keep worries to themselves have more worries about grades. Those who turn to parents for information are less likely to worry about being liked, failure, their future, and their friends than those who turn to other sources (teachers, Internet, and friends).

For the past 300 years, the question of the &quot;right way&quot; to educate deaf children has been at the center of a bitter educational dispute. Before that time,  education was not an issue, as virtually every society took the term &quot;deaf and dumb&quot; quite literally. The idea that deaf children were capable of education constituted a dramatic breakthrough, but it came with a heavy price as it was based on two very divergent ideas: communication through sign language or teaching the deaf to speak.

This paper focuses on determining two things: whether the level of participation in PA contributes to adolescents' PA attitudes and their quality of life-related body image and to examine whether there is a difference. The study utilized the cross-sectional design. 1281 individuals in the middle adolescence period participated in the study. Participants were between 15 and 17 years. International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF), Cognitive Behavioral Physical Activity Questionnaire (CBPAQ), and Body Image Quality of Life Inventory (BIQLI) were used as data collection tools. According to the study findings, there were significant differences in the BIQLI total, interaction with the opposite sex, and influence behavior/attitude between those who engaged in regular or irregular PA and those who did not engage in PA at all. Difference in the effect on self-efficacy and daily life sub-dimension was found between those who engaged in regular PA and those who did not. Outcome expectation and self-regulation items of those who engaged in PA were higher than for those who did not. Since adolescents are expected to engage in regular or irregular PA, personal barriers in front of them must be removed. It is therefore important to support their attitudes, which positively affects their PA, because participation in PA contributes positively to their PA and BI-related quality of life.", "subject": ["Adolescents", "Physical Activities", "Physical Activity Level", "Self Concept", "Human Body", "Body Composition", "Body Height", "Body Weight", "Barriers", "Self Efficacy", "Foreign Countries", "Interaction", "Self Management", "Quality of Life", "Gender Differences", "Athletics"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Research"], "publicationdateyear": 2022, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["EISSN-1857-6036"], "publisher": "European Scientific Institute.

Because of these developments, this study expanded the integrative activity curriculum for second-grade elementary school students to an innovative curriculum involving a comprehensive set of activities related to remote-control cars and their use in the community. The students underwent a process of experiential learning in which they became familiar with the operation of remote-control cars.

Purpose: Looking at the main patterns in their careers before, during, and after completing NYCTF, the study provides insights into the short- and long-term impacts of mathematics teachers who entered as first- and second-career teachers on NYC public schools and the people in them. Participants: The study tracked the career trajectories and decision-making of more than 600 NYCTF mathematics teachers over a 9-year period. Research design: The longitudinal analysis of the teachers' career trajectories is illuminated by descriptive statistics and qualitative analyses of their responses to open-ended survey items. Results: The article provides a portrait of urban mathematics teachers' career decision-making as it unfolds over time. It challenges conventional understandings by demonstrating the stochastic nature of teachers' career decision-making and, as part of this, consequential amounts of involuntary and midyear turnover. It further shows that, although in many ways similar, the career trajectories of the career changers and recent college graduates differed in key regards. Recommendations: On their own, strategies designed to attract high-achieving recent graduates and professional career changers to teach core subjects like mathematics will not solve long-standing teacher turnover and shortage issues in in high-needs urban schools.

A semi-structured interview was used to collect the data from these tutorials. To analyze the data a content analysis technique with MAXQDA 2020 program was utilized. Instructors of Turkish as a foreign language stated that material and instructor proficiency are the most common factors in foreign language teaching, while motivation, attitude and anxiety are the most common internal factors. According to the results of the study, speaking is the language skill most affected by anxiety. It was concluded that the most common causes of speaking anxiety experienced by the students were the fear of being ridiculed, the thought of failure, and the lack of personal development.

The purpose of this case study was to explore preservice English teachers' reading identities and their perceptions of reading identity development in the context of English classrooms. Design/methodology/approach: This study used qualitative collective case design. Data sources included analogy exercise about participants' reading identities, participant-generated observations of reading identity instruction, questionnaire on reading identity, class discussions about reading identity and final written reflection. Findings: Data showed examples of participants' reading identities as taking a variety of forms, but when discussing what shaped their reading identities, the strongest codes related to positive interactions with people and texts. The data showed that participants related positive reading identities to both reading to learn and reading for pleasure. More participants' perceived their professional identity as that of a literature teacher than a reading teacher. Research limitations/implications: Future research is needed on how to support preservice teachers' positive reading identities in English education courses. Practical implications: Our data suggest that learning about reading identity may help preservice English teachers think of reading as something that is developing in themselves as well as their students over a lifetime. By providing space in English methods programs to attend to preservice teachers' reading lives, we can help them rekindle or find their love of reading.

We have an excellent opportunity to model an inclusive community, with hundreds of thousands of students passing through introductory college courses each year. A previous study documented gender and racial bias in physical geology textbooks. Six texts were reexamined to determine any progress. Individuals or groups engaged in scientific activities were considered geologists. Geologists were shown in 567 (8.6%) of the 6593 photos. Of the 499 identifiable geologists in the photos, 346 are male (69.3%), 153 are female (30.7%). Out of 346 males, 307 are white (88.7%), 20 are racially diverse (5.8%), and 19 are unknown (5.5%). Out of 153 females, 137 are white (89.6%), 10 are racially diverse (6.5%), and 6 are unknown (3.9%). The more recent editions of the textbooks showed 2.8 times more photos of geologists. Physical geology books portrayed males as 2.3 times more likely to be geologists than females. This ratio significantly exceeds the near equal proportions of men and women entering the geosciences. The books implied that white geologists are nearly 15 times more abundant in the workforce compared to their nonwhite peers. This ratio differs significantly from the data for recent graduates and the general U.S. population (about 3:1 for both data sets). The number of identifiable minority geologists increased to 30 from the original 8. These numbers remain discouragingly low, and some double minorities--such as African-American females and Asian females--are rare (10 of 6593 photos) or absent (female Latinx, 0 of 6593 photos).

An Investigation of the Internal/External Frame of Reference Model Using Implicit Self-Concepts", "author": ["Wolff, Fabian", "Helm, Friederike", "Junge, Fynn", "M\u00f6ller, Jens"], "description": "Dimensional comparisons are comparisons of one's accomplishments between two domains (e.g., comparisons between math and verbal achievements) that affect our self-perceptions in the domains compared with each other. In particular, dimensional comparisons explain the seemingly paradoxical finding, described in the internal/external frame of reference (I/E) model, that students' math (verbal) achievement has a negative effect on their verbal (math) self-concept (dimensional comparison effect), while controlling for the positive effect of verbal (math) achievement on verbal (math) self-concept (social comparison effect). The present study is the first to examine awareness of dimensional and social comparisons by testing the I/E model with implicit and explicit self-concepts. Using a sample of 795 students from Germany, we measured students' implicit self-concepts using a go/no-go association task. Students' explicit self-concepts were measured using common rating scales. Overall, we were able to replicate the I/E model relations (negative dimensional comparison effects, positive social comparison effects) with both kinds of self-concept operationalization, suggesting that dimensional and social comparisons are also performed unconsciously. The effects of students' achievements on their explicit self-concepts were usually stronger than those on their implicit self-concepts. However, whereas (in line with prior studies of the I/E model) the dimensional comparison effects were significantly weaker than the social comparison effects in the I/E model with explicit self-concepts, dimensional and social comparison effects were equally strong in the I/E model with implicit self-concepts. This finding emphasizes the relative importance of dimensional comparisons in the process of implicit self-concept formation.", "subject": ["Models", "Self Concept", "Task Analysis", "Comparative Analysis", "Mathematics Achievement", "Verbal Ability", "Peer Groups", "Student Attitudes", "Rating Scales", "Foreign Countries", "Self Evaluation (Individuals)", "Grade 9", "Secondary School Students"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Research"], "publicationdateyear": 2020, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["ISSN-0022-0663"], "publisher": "American Psychological Association.

From this perspective, learning is completely dependent on teaching, just as students are under the authority of the teacher. In a sense, this is a situation of a specific kind of symbolic violence. It has its sources in traditional ways of understanding education as a particular form of training produced in the school. But this is not the only reason. Another one is a tacit assumption about the correctness of na\u00efve realism: the belief that we can obtain objective and universal knowledge of the external world. In this article I argue that this generates the situation in which students' thinking is subordinated to the system. Such education kills free and critical thinking, as well as effectively blocking social change. In other words, the current public educational system is oppressive at its very basis, because of its epistemological assumptions.

Coupled with 160 observations of touchscreen practice, this allowed the opportunity to critique intentions with practice, to determine children's opportunities to play with, and potentially learn from, touchscreen technologies. Capturing child voice was an integral aspect of this study. By providing the opportunity for children to express their views through four focus-group interviews, the study found that there was a distinct difference between children's and practitioners' intentions regarding touchscreen play. As a result, practitioners overlooked opportunities to strengthen children's learning by following their interests. The data were analysed using activity theory as a central theoretical framework.

However, the underlying assumptions of linear SEM often prove unrealistic, making the decomposition of direct and indirect effects problematic. Recent advancements in causal mediation analysis can help to address these shortcomings, allowing for causal inference when a new set of identifying assumptions are satisfied. This article reviews how these ideas can be generalized to multiple mediators, with a focus on the post-treatment confounding and causal ordering cases.

An increasingly critical challenge is how to most effectively engage with student perspectives to more effectively understand the nature of their learning experiences. Traditionally, student ratings have been the primary means with which to understand the student voice. Although approaches to student ratings have fragmented in recent years with diversifying research interest in student satisfaction, experience and engagement, relatively limited attention has been given to the epistemological underpinnings of ratings-based surveys or toward emerging alternative approaches to engaging the student voice. This paper analyses the epistemic foundations of ratings-based methods in the context of other emerging strategies that attempt to engage with student voices more collaboratively. From this analysis, a map of the range of current and emerging approaches to the capturing of the student evaluative voice is proposed to identify their key characteristics in understanding and prospectively shaping practice. This analysis demonstrates that although alternative methods possess a clear potential to respond more effectively to the ever more complex pedagogical demands, their potential is limited by the hegemony of the 'surveyed voice' and the resource challenges of sustaining heightened student engagement.", "subject": ["College Students", "Higher Education", "Student Evaluation of Teacher Performance", "Rating Scales", "Evaluation Methods", "Student Participation", "Qualitative Research", "Cooperation", "Epistemology"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Research"], "publicationdateyear": 2021, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["ISSN-0729-4360"], "publisher": "Routledge.

However, investigations on nursing students' research competency in the context of competency-based education (CBE) remain underreported. Objective: This study investigated the predictors and associations of Saudi nursing students' research competencies using CBE approach. Methods: This research used a descriptive, cross-sectional design. A total enumeration sampling or census of 347 nursing students from three Saudi Arabian state universities who had finished the nursing research course was used. The 24-item Research Competency Scale for Nursing Students (RCS-N) was utilized to collect data, which was then analyzed using the chi-squared test and logistic regression. Results: Most nursing students were familiar with the nursing research process. There is a strong link between research competencies and age and marks obtained in nursing research course. Age and nursing research course marks (A+/A) were significant predictors of nursing research competency. Thus, students who earned A+/A grades were three times more likely to be competent than those who had lower grades. Similarly, nursing students over the age of 20 years are twice as likely to be research competent as those under 20. Conclusion: As there are few reports on nursing research competency, CBE helps nursing research instructors create relevant intended learning outcomes (ILOs), allowing them to assess each research step's ILOs more efficiently. Additionally, incorporating functionalist, behaviorist, and constructivist learning theories into the CBE in nursing research course will be more beneficial.", "subject": ["Student Evaluation", "Nursing Students", "Research Skills", "Competency Based Education", "Foreign Countries", "Predictor Variables", "Age Differences", "Grades (Scholastic)"], "publicationtype": ["Journal Articles", "Reports - Research"], "publicationdateyear": 2021, "language": ["English"], "issn": ["EISSN-2379-6154"], "publisher": "Wiley.

Method: Ten older adults with bilateral mild to moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss rated the sound quality of sentences processed through a hearing aid simulation and presented in the presence of five different noise types (six-talker babble, three-talker conversation, street traffic, kitchen, and fast-food restaurant) at four SNRs (3, 8, 12, and 20 dB). Results: Everyday noise types differentially affected sound quality ratings even when presented at the same SNR: Kitchen and three-talker noises were rated significantly higher than restaurant, traffic, and multitalker babble, which were not different from each other. The effects of noise type were most pronounced at poorer SNRs. Conclusions: The findings of this study showed that noise types differentially affected sound quality ratings. The differences we observed were consistent with the acoustic characteristics of the noise types.
