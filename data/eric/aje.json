        "description":"This article examines the importance of caring in schools and school leadership. It analyzes the concept of caring and how it functions and introduces a model of caring school leadership situated within this broader exposition. The analysis and model are informed by literature including academic and professional works from education and education-related fields and disciplines--philosophy, ethics, feminist theory, positive psychology, and the organizational sciences. In addition, the analysis and model draws on literature of human-service occupations--health care, social services, and the ministry--that consider caring and caring leadership at both interpersonal and organizational levels. The synthesis of this literature results in a multidisciplinary and cross-occupational model that extends and deepens current understanding and theory about caring school leadership.",

Mismatches in parents' and teachers' perceptions of each other may negatively affect children's outcomes. Using survey data collected from parents and teachers in 52 low-income, predominantly Latino schools, we explore subgroup variation in parents' and teachers' perceptions of their relationship, and we examine the potential of a school-based family engagement program to shift these perceptions. We find notable misalignment in parents' and teachers' perceptions when parents are Spanish-dominant Latinos. We also find that a family engagement program improves parents' and teachers' perceptions of their relationship but does not eliminate the gap between teachers' and Spanish-dominant Latino parents' perceptions of one another.",

        "description":"School principals can play an important role in promoting teacher leadership by delegating authority and empowering teachers in ways that allow them influence in key organizational decisions and processes. However, it is unclear whether instruction and student learning are enhanced by promoting teacher influence in all aspects of school organization or whether it is better for principals to directly work on certain processes while delegating influence on others. We compare pathways from principal leadership through school organizational processes to student outcomes that include teacher influence as a mediating factor to pathways that do not include teachers' influence. Our results suggest that effective principals use teacher leadership to improve the school learning climate while they work directly on professional development and school program coherence.",

        "description":"We examine how teachers whom students identified as being relatively more or less engaging spoke differently about how they use information on student engagement to inform their teaching. Using 3 years of data from teacher focus groups in which 21 teachers discussed their perceptions of student engagement and reactions to annual student surveys, we found that highly engaging and less engaging teachers differed along dimensions of reflectiveness, adaptivity, and support. Together, these orientations revealed a sense of agency over student engagement that was more evident in the comments of more engaging teachers. The differences in how the two groups conceptualized engagement and used information on engagement to change their practice have important implications for efforts to increase student engagement.",

        "description":"Previous research focusing on major philanthropic foundations suggests that these actors have collectively converged around a set of jurisdictional challengers promoting market-based education reforms. Using correspondence analysis, network analysis, and geographic information science, this article empirically tests whether this convergence has permeated to less prominent foundations and their grantees, or if these foundations are pursuing alternative organizational strategies to shape K-12 outcomes. The analysis draws from a sample of 15 nonmajor foundations and their 1,069 grantees serving some aspect of K-12 education in 2010. We find that nonmajor foundations have adopted some elements of major foundations' organizational strategies to influence K-12 education but that their strategies are heterogeneous and reflect both challenges to--and opportunities for--a more varied and democratic structure of policy making.",

        "description":"There has been a long-standing concern among education researchers and policy makers that public school choice may lead to increased racial isolation. Improving on aggregate comparisons, I examine the sorting of students into charter schools by tracking individual students from their charter school of enrollment back to the school they were enrolled in immediately prior to the switch to a charter school, allowing for a direct comparison of school racial demographics between the two sectors. I find evidence that the process of charter school choice in Indianapolis leads to higher degrees of racial isolation and less diversity within schools than is present in the underlying process of student school transfers in the public school district from which a majority of these students came.",

The article analyzes data from an ethnographic study of teachers' work in two high-poverty urban public schools. The study shows that as instructional mandates emphasized a narrowed curriculum, teachers' professional discretion diminished. When teachers felt forced to work in ways that misaligned with their beliefs about teaching and learning, they were unable to secure pleasure and enjoyment in the course of their work.",

        "description":"Popular understandings of segregation often emphasize the Jim Crow South before the 1954 &quot;Brown&quot; decision and, in many instances, explain continued segregation in schooling as the result of segregated housing patterns. The case of Flint, Michigan, complicates these views, at once illustrating the depth of governmental commitment to segregation in a northern community and showing how segregated schools and neighborhoods helped construct one another. The Flint case also reveals new modes of segregationist thought. Throughout much of the twentieth century, Flint's city leaders thought of segregation as splitting, and they sought to divide their city along racial lines. But they thought of segregation as joining as well. Drawing on various strands of progressive reform and educational thought, Flint's educational, business, and philanthropic leaders believed community bonds would be stronger in segregated neighborhoods anchored by their schools. Flint's &quot;community schools&quot; program worked toward this end, exemplifying the paired embrace of segregation as joining and splitting, and becoming a model for educators in hundreds of cities nationwide.",

After summarizing the relationship between unions and school boards in rural and suburban school districts, the article describes the legal impact of teacher strikes in those areas. It concludes with a discussion of the changes to public sector labor law during the 1970s and a brief reflection on the importance of small-town teachers' unions today.",

This article argues for an additional complementary explanation for underachievement and school failure. Namely, it suggests that high school underachievement in Latino children of immigrants can be attributed in part to the bureaucratic nature of schooling and a constant onslaught of bureaucratic errors and omissions. Based upon a 5-year multiple-case study in the southeastern United States, it finds that bureaucratic dysfunctions figured prominently in the education of Latino immigrant youth. The article calls for more research on the impact of bureaucratic errors on educational paths of immigrant students and argues that educators might profitably draw from work on organizational failure to help Latino children of immigrants navigate school bureaucracies more successfully.",

We used a multifaceted framework on school climate to assess the degree to which school attachment, disciplinary order, disciplinary fairness, and academic climate are associated with individuals dropping out of high school. Additionally, we examined how structural and compositional characteristics of schools influence school climate and dropping out of school. Our findings indicate that attending a high school with better disciplinary order and stronger school attachment for the students is associated with a decreased likelihood of dropping out, above and beyond individual characteristics.",

        "description":"Lifting achievement in many schools depends on reducing the exit of effective teachers. We examine the extent to which teacher perceptions of school cohesion and intrinsic motivators stemming from two theoretical traditions contribute to the intent to leave one's school. We find that elementary teachers report higher levels of organizational cohesion within their schools along with stronger intrinsic motivation compared with peers teaching at the high school level, drawing on data from 548 teachers in Los Angeles schools. Teacher perceptions of school cohesion are moderately correlated with intrinsic motivators. However, views of strong leadership and teacher cohesion, not one's own intrinsic motivation, more strongly predict the likelihood of remaining at one's school, based on structural equation estimation with IRT-adjusted measurement models. We discuss implications for shaping interventions to strengthen the social cohesion of schools rather than simply rewarding individual teachers.",

        "description":"State K-12 assessments may soon include measures for college readiness, as California's already do. We seek to understand how California's Early Assessment Program (EAP, designed to assess high school juniors' college readiness in English and math) may have influenced overall school-level college readiness and state accountability outcomes. Using administrative data, we first examine variation in EAP participation across California's public high schools and what accounts for the variation in the early years of the program. Second, we ask whether different levels of EAP participation have influenced school outcomes. Finally, we ask whether the EAP has led to changes in schoolwide accountability measures by increasing eleventh-grade students' testing performance. We find that schools with higher participation in these aligned assessments witnessed small improvements on the state's primary accountability metric, but not through raising individual stakes for students. Results have important consequences for policymakers and education leaders designing and implementing Common Core State Standards with college-readiness assessments.",

A lack of racial and ethnic diversity persists in STEM education and industries; consequently, the inspiration of black and Latinx students in STEM warrants exploration. Data were collected from 38 black and Latinx STEM students using semistructured, life-story interviews. Students' desire to help others indicates a need to revisit the emphasis on financial success in STEM fields. Furthermore, results point to the need for STEM education programs that present broader STEM career possibilities, including careers that integrate social justice, empathy, and equity matters.",

However, it is unknown whether relationships vary across student racial/ethnic and generational groups. Moreover, the link between teacherstudent relationships and students' academic expectations remains unclear. Using the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, a nationally representative sample of high schoolers, I found that not all groups of students enjoy strong teacher-student relationships: English teachers report weaker relationships with Asian American students and mathematics teachers with their Latino students compared with thirdgeneration white students. These relationships are important predictors of student expectations.

This longitudinal study examines the rounds practice of a network of superintendents over 6 years to understand how rounds serves as a vehicle for addressing inequities in students' educational experiences. Using Scott's concept of normative, regulative, and cultural-cognitive pillars, we investigate the practice to see how the network addressed issues of equity in 21 visits. Findings demonstrate that increased attention to equity in the protocol and visit expectations resulted in increased attention to equity. However, conversations manifested three patterns that functioned to curtail a focus on equity: understating race, the &quot;culture of nice,&quot; and following the protocol. We conclude with implications for how rounds can be structured to bring equity into sustained focus, with an understanding of regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive pillars as constantly interacting.",

In this paper, I explore these patterns using a complete cohort of Chicago Public School high school freshmen in 2009 (N = 24,019) and explore the characteristics of different schools that students living in the same neighborhood attend. Students in poor and violent neighborhoods attend schools that are more heterogeneous in terms of type, achievement, safety, and student demographics. Students from these neighborhoods also scatter geographically to schools across the city, many traveling quite long distances. In contrast, students from safe and affluent neighborhoods attend many fewer schools, are less likely to make long distance trips, and are more likely to attend school with a large proportion of their neighbors.",

Negative stereotypes emerged as an important topic from the narratives of 20 male and 20 female tribal academics in a variety of disciplines whom the author interviewed at 28 universities across the United States. Within the subjective experiences of their mainstream professional engagements, participants used their culturally specific worldviews and the corresponding understandings of adverse circumstances to deconstruct and ultimately transform negative stereotypes into sources of empowerment. Culturally specific master narratives facilitated resilience in persons who consciously engaged, instead of avoided, circumstances that enabled them to feel they are disproving negative stereotypes by their personal examples, representing and working toward their groups' better future.

        "description":"Drawing on ethnographic research in urban schools serving recently arrived immigrant students in New York City, this article considers the importance of drawing on transnational attachments in culturally sustaining pedagogy for newcomer immigrant students. The authors document how recently arrived immigrant youth narrated real and imagined transnational attachments as they described their past, current, and future lives in the United States and in home countries. Furthermore, they show how educators recognize and build on young people's connections to homelands in their classrooms and in the teaching of academic content to promote the belonging and engagement of their students. Thus, the authors argue that by recognizing and engaging students' transnational knowledge, experiences, and attachments, educators are engaging in a culturally sustaining pedagogy that prepares students for our changing globalized world.",

Conceptual models drawn from organizational theory, however, offer competing predictions about how district central office administrators are likely to leverage their professional expertise in devolved decision making about school funding. To explore deregulation policy in practice, I examine resource decision making in two urban school districts using the case of a 2009 California school funding deregulation policy. I argue that expertise is a key political dynamic in district resource decision making, setting the framework by which decision makers interpret and weigh local school quality, cost, and equity concerns and, as a result, reallocate deregulated dollars.",

Follow-up analyses within the subsample of the first- and second-generation youth indicate that more recent arrival to the United States predicted higher reading achievement.

The changing policy environment for mentoring beginning teachers in Flanders (Belgium) provides a fertile context for answering this question. Combining neoinstitutional and sensemaking lenses and analyzing the mentoring practices in one school, we investigated the role of mentors' sensemaking in shaping responses to changes in the broader institutional environment. Based on semistructured interviews, observations, and document analyses, the study identifies how the introduction, and later withdrawal, of direct financial support for mentoring installed a new logic of mentoring as a professionalized job and how mentors creatively employed elements of this new logic in their daily interactions. The study contributes to the recent research on inhabited institutionalism by demonstrating that organizations are not only the instantiation of institutional logics, but are sites where people and groups make sense of and creatively use institutional logics.",

Using neoinstitutional theory, this article highlights the interrelationship between macrolevel structures and microlevel practices, particularly discussing the &quot;lived logics&quot; used throughout the implementation of a new reading program. I explicate two logics of reading instruction: Accountability First and Just Read, which coexisted within the district to provide formal and informal rules to structure action. To reveal the complexities of educators' enactment of logics, this article portrays how district leaders advanced each logic. It also depicts how coaches hybridized the logics, with consequences for the direction of reform. It shows how educators in different leadership positions engage together with logics.

This cross-case qualitative study uses a qualitative approach of social network analysis to uncover the mechanisms through which first-year principals encountered particular beliefs about instructional leadership. To do so, I studied six first-year principals who came to their positions through four distinct paths, examining their informal social networks. I found, first, that their networks' structures influenced the spread of instructional leadership ideas from the environment to individuals at the mesolevel. Second, the findings suggest that preparation programs mattered for how the principals conceptualized instructional leadership. This research contributes to our understanding of the relationship between institutional ideas and practice in schools, principal preparation, and professional development.

However, little research has examined how competition for students actually operates in socially embedded education markets. Economic approaches tend to emphasize individual actors' choices and agency, an undersocialized perspective, whereas sociological approaches emphasize social structures such as race, class, and institutions over agency, an oversocialized view. In this study, I examine the interplay between structure and agency in education markets to (a) examine how a school's position in the market hierarchy influences how it is represented and viewed as a rival by network competitors and to (b) explore how a school's position in the network of competitors influences the possible and actual strategic actions that schools adopt in response to market pressures. Using case studies from New Orleans, I find that school leaders' positions in the socially constructed market hierarchy and in a social network of competitors influence their actions, which further determine their market positions.",

        "description":"Much debate surrounding teacher quality has focused on students' standardized test scores, but recent federal and state initiatives have emphasized the use of multiple measures to evaluate teacher quality, including classroom observations. In this study, we explore differences across school districts in the relationship between student achievement outcomes and the observed quality of teachers' instruction. Using data from 298 elementary mathematics teachers in five urban US districts, we examine relationships between teachers' performance on the Mathematical Quality of Instruction observation instrument and their students' scores on both state standardized and researcher-developed tests. We find that these relationships differ across school districts. We explore the extent to which differences in skills and expectations for students across tests may explain this variability. An improved understanding of the relationship between classroom observations and student tests may help districts to better support teachers in developing their instructional effectiveness.",

These schools provide a no-cost opportunity for students to earn college credit--or a 2-year degree--while in high school. Using rich administrative data on multiple cohorts of students and quasiexperimental methods informed by the within-study comparison literature, we estimate program impacts of enrolling in a North Carolina early college in ninth grade on a variety of secondary and postsecondary outcomes. We include all such schools in the state, and we report generally promising findings. Early colleges increase important high school outcomes, boost associate's degree completion, and raise 4-year-college enrollment at less selective public institutions. We also show the differences of these impacts across race, home-district performance, and host site, helping us better understand the implementation and effects of this promising intervention in one state that has brought this school reform model to scale.",

Using statewide high school data from Michigan, our regression discontinuity analyses show that the bottom 5% of schools identified as persistently lowest achieving (PLA), which is publicly announced and has consequential accountability, increased their student performance in writing and to a lesser extent in mathematics and social studies. The PLA effect in writing is quite robust, based on various sensitivity analyses. We find no improvement in student achievement for the bottom 6% to 20% of schools labeled as &quot;watch list&quot; that received no actual penalties and little public attention. Our findings suggest that schools respond differently to varying forms of labeling as low performing, depending on the levels of accountability pressure and social stigmatization.",

Their responses differed notably by school, depending largely on the principal's approach to implementation. In the three schools where teachers assessed teams favorably, principals set a meaningful purpose for teachers' collaborative work, provided structural support and professional expertise for their deliberations, and established safe environments for teachers' on-the-job growth.",

We also demonstrate how TFA alumni embrace largely managerial, technocratic responses to inequality. Finally, we reveal how the majority of alumni who work in education do so in privatized settings that emphasize management, entrepreneurship, and accountability.

We analyze nationally representative survey data to fill this gap. Exceptional students are significantly less likely than their mainstream counterparts to participate in organized summer activities and summer day care but are more likely to attend summer school and to practice math with a parent. Exceptional learners make significantly greater reading gains during the summer vacation than their mainstream counterparts; however, this is true only for middle- and high-income exceptional learners. Moreover, the well-documented summer learning loss of low-income students in reading appears to be entirely driven by lower summer learning rates of low-income exceptional learners.

Although researchers attribute the low educational attainment of this population mainly to poverty and poor school quality, many scholars continue to believe that historically rooted cultural norms and kinship bonds also inhibit ambitions regarding higher education. However, statements written during the 1950s by students in isolated rural districts not only indicate a level of enthusiasm for higher education that matched the national average but also rarely note parental discouragement or conflicting cultural impulses. At the start of the greatest enrollment surge in American history, rural high school students reconciled their college ambitions with the desire to serve their families and communities--a tendency that suggests cultural barriers to college access ranked far below financial, informational, and academic impediments.",

To encourage positive preventive and responsive school discipline practices, policies must address administrators' misconceptions about ineffective practices by providing both pressure and support for change.",

Results of this multilevel regression analysis suggest that MKT and instructional vision are related to instruction in different ways. On average, MKT scores were positively related to the current year's quality of instruction but not to growth, whereas instructional vision was positively related to growth in instructional quality. Additionally, the analyses revealed different patterns of change depending on teachers' instructional vision and practice at the outset of the study.",

In this article, we investigate two research questions: (1) Is there a relationship between teacher job satisfaction and students' math and reading growth in elementary school? (2) How do schools' organizational cultures moderate the relationship between teacher job satisfaction and student achievement growth? We examined these questions using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey and found that teacher job satisfaction has a modest but positive relationship with students' reading growth but no relationship with students' math growth between kindergarten and fifth grade. However, school culture and teacher job satisfaction interactively affect student achievement in both math and reading. We argue that future education reforms should place special emphasis on improving teacher job satisfaction and school culture.",

We find that John Kingdon's three streams--problems, politics, and policies--all aligned in the years preceding TEVAL's adoption and were supported by local policy entrepreneurs. Notably, we also find that TEVAL's progress was further facilitated by the relationships and interactions among the participants themselves.",

Using a mixed-methods approach, we examined the role of both formal organizational infrastructure and individual characteristics in shaping advice and information interactions about instruction among school staff within and between schools. Our findings from social-network models showed that, while individual characteristics were associated with within- and between-school ties, aspects of the formal school organization had larger effects. Moreover, having a subject-specific leadership position most strongly predicted between-school ties. Our analysis of interview data supported and extended these findings, showing that leadership positions worked in tandem with other aspects of the organizational infrastructure, such as organizational routines, to influence school staff members' interactions about instruction.",

This is true despite many ethnographic accounts of good students being stigmatized and directly bullied on account of their status as good students. With that research gap in mind, data from a nationally representative cohort of US high school sophomores were analyzed to examine the contexts in which students were bullied because of their academic orientations. The results show that being a male student with a high GPA and being a male student who spends more time on homework increases one's risk of bullying victimization.

Some observers have attributed states' embrace of the standards to the substantial financial incentives that the federal government embedded in its $4.35 billion Race to the Top initiative. Despite these perceptions, little is known about states' adoption and the degree to which federal incentivization conditioned their decisions. Using an innovation diffusion conceptual lens and event history analysis, we test the influence of states' aspiration for Race to the Top funds, controlling for a set of other predictors typically correlated with states' decisions to undertake policy adoption.",

These systems generally include observational and/or student survey measures of instructional quality alongside measures of teachers' contributions to student learning (e.g., value-added models [VAMs]). While the research base on VAMs is large and growing, less is known about the measures of instructional quality. This study focuses on the year-to-year stability of observational and student survey measures, drawing on data from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's Measures of Effective Teaching (MET) study. Results suggest that the observational and student survey measures used in MET are somewhat more stable than measures of teachers' contributions to student learning, but the stability is lower than that found in comparable measures in higher education. Nevertheless, reclassification rates based on these measures are high, particularly when based on criterion-referenced cut scores.",

We argue that market-like behavior is nested in segments of local organizational fields with different types of charter school operators seeking market niches to reduce resource uncertainties. We first describe the emergence of three legally defined charter types in the Los Angeles Unified School District between 2002 and 2008. We show how these charter segments became stratified, as gauged by demographic attributes and quite different baseline achievement levels. While this structuration could also plausibly condition uneven achievement effects, we find that, in this initial period of charter expansion, all three types failed to raise achievement, compared with the achievement growth trajectories displayed by peers attending regular public schools.",

We conducted a content analysis of 480 school district mission statements from Pennsylvania to understand the relationships between school and place and the locally articulated purposes of schooling. Strikingly uniform use of language and themes across multiple district contexts suggests that (a) district mission statements may not be representative of locally articulated visions of schooling and (b) the influences of local context may be superseded by broader institutional discourses regarding the purposes of education and schooling.",

Unfortunately, minimal research centers on the experiences of American Indian youth. In response, this qualitative study explores American Indian responses to hostile campus climates. Using a Tribal Critical Race Theory framework, this article examines hostile school policies and leadership practices and student responses in a public high school with a majority population of American Indian students who reside on a reservation. Two main themes emerged: (a) the school neglected students' educational needs and views, and (b) the school marginalized Native students through specific policies. As this study demonstrates, American Indian youth's daily encounters in a racially charged high school environment affect their identities and well-being. Implications and recommendations for research, policy, and practice are included.",

The National  Indian Education Study (NIES) is the only large-scale study focused on (AIAN) students' cultural  experiences within the context of schools. Given that NIES also includes achievement on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), it has the potential to inform and guide policy directed specifically toward AIAN students. To examine ways NIES might potentially inform policy, the present study examined the degree to which AIAN student experiences as reflected in NIES are associated with achievement on NAEP. We then examined NIES against a CRS framework and found that  NIES could inform policy to the detriment of AIAN students.",

The history of American educational research is marred by a near complete dismissal of Indigenous knowledge, as Western research methodologies continue to define the landscape of P-12 education decision making in the United States. The purpose of this article is to embrace inquiry that draws on the Indigenous wisdom germane to Native communities. Otherwise, our educational policy and practice may continue to be  dictated by a Western orientation and methodologies that have neither served us well in our past nor will serve us well in the future. The article begins with a historical overview and then focuses on current issues affecting school leadership (P-12), as they relate to the education of American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians (and by extension, other Indigenous students). The article addresses the following areas: challenges to Western research methodologies, culturally relevant education, the development of school reform, and ideologies governing P-12  leadership development programs. To conclude, the article advances a rationale for including Indigenous research methodologies in the development of curriculum standards and testing programs.",

The objective of this study was to investigate how leadership and accountability in American Indian schools and communities in New Mexico is recognized, characterized, contested, and envisioned by students, teachers, and community members. We contend that American Indian communities are uniquely positioned to provide insights for understanding leadership and visions of decolonized and empowering education for American Indian communities. Our data come from focus groups and interviews with American Indian students, parents, and community members, as well as teachers in seven public school districts in New Mexico. Participants described how they observed leadership enacted and how they participated in New Mexico public schools. We found participants describing unequal power relations, yet they also held visions of school leadership embedded in the values and definitions of leadership traditionally and historically held in American Indian communities. These visions of leadership centered around the importance of sustaining and strengthening American Indian communities and self-determination.",

In the process of improving education and schooling for Indigenous students, Indigenous educational leadership needs to be considered alongside educational leadership more generally. This article focuses on a particular Indigenous landscape--Maori--and examines tensions relating to a project about educational leadership linked with desired student outcomes. The tensions are located in identifying generic aspects of educational leadership in relation to desired student outcomes on the one hand and ensuring that distinctive features of Maori leadership are recognized on the other. lndigeneity is identified as a space in which such ongoing tensions can be addressed and in which what is wanted from Maori educational leadership can be examined and established.",

This has left all stakeholders looking for novel solutions while perhaps ignoring extant but underused programs. This article examines the effect of &quot;summer bridge&quot; programs, which have students enroll in coursework prior to beginning their first full academic year, on associate&apos;s and bachelor&apos;s degree completion. We make use of the Beyond Postsecondary (BPS) transcript data as well as data from one large university system. Our analysis utilizes propensity score matching to account for selection effects among students. We find that at community colleges and less selective 4-year colleges, students who attend bridge programs are 10 percentage points more likely to finish within 6 years. We discuss our findings in the context of how colleges might better use their existing initiatives to improve student outcomes, and in light of recent findings from a randomized controlled trial study.",

Board of Education&quot; (1954) was a landmark decision that was the result of decades of efforts by grassroots activists and civil rights organizations to end legalized segregation. A less well-known effort challenged the extralegal segregation of Mexican American students in the Southwest. I combine original research and research synthesis to explore the connections between these legal campaigns. Three key differences between African American and Mexican American segregation had important implications for the legal strategies in the latter: (a) de jure versus extralegal segregation; (b) the legal whiteness of Mexican Americans; and (c) the racialization of language. While both sets of lawsuits drew on social science research to challenge segregation, differences in timing and legal arguments seem to have prevented sustained connections between the two efforts.",

Through 86 interviews and 22 hours of admissions committee observations, findings reveal that conceptions of merit changed throughout the review process.

        "description":"This article focuses on the extent to which devalued forms of capital along with limited access to valued cultural capital facilitated the access and persistence of 33 Mexican American PhDs who earned their doctorates in a variety of disciplines at 15 universities across the United States. Using the framework of community cultural wealth, this study uncovered and contextualized the ways that Mexican American PhDs activated navigational capital, resistant capital, social capital, aspirational capital, and legitimated forms of cultural capital in order to access graduate school. In order to persevere in their doctoral studies, however, participants were often reminded that cultural capital was necessary for gaining access to socialization processes and support mechanisms that would lead to funding opportunities and faculty careers. This study illustrates the extent to which participants&apos; forms of capital (including cultural capital) were valued within hegemonic and oppressive institutions.",

To meet this need, the authors examined the content each of the state LIEPs, focusing chiefly on the extent to which the types of language support, as well as the stipulations associated with them, are made explicit. Using US Census data from 1970 and 2009, the authors assessed LIEPs in the context of Latino population patterns and examined the relationship between the degree to which state LIEPs emphasize bilingual education and fourth-grade Latino English learners' achievement patterns in reading, mathematics, and science achievement on the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) for all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Latino English learners in states with a higher proportion of Latinos tend to have higher achievement outcomes when policies emphasize bilingual education, but these states also have a longer history of Latino presence.

This article examines an urban high school that challenges traditional expectations for low-income, Latina/o students by engaging in &quot;relabeling,&quot; a process whereby school staff socialize students, who have been viewed historically as not &quot;college material,&quot; to see themselves as collegebound professionals. The authors use this school as a critical case study to highlight the importance of challenging negative messages about Latina/o youth and affirming students' potential, inculcating behaviors associated with academic and professional success, and marshaling multicultural capital to prepare students to navigate between the worlds of college and home. Authors also describe the tensions in balancing dominant and nondominant cultures, comportment and academics, and &quot;ganas&quot; (determination) and high standards. These findings contribute to deepening relabeling theory in three critical domains: rethinking Bourdieu's cultural capital theory, developing academic college-level skills, and affirming multicultural capital.",

        "description":"Using data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, a nationally representative sample of US high school students, I investigate how features of secondary schools influence the likelihood of Latino students completing high school. To do so, I introduce the concept of school incorporation, which includes school policies, school receptivity climate, and school coethnic community. Based on multilevel analysis, I find that attending schools where students feel safe and where students report having same-race friendships is associated with increased odds of graduation, as is attending a school that offers college preparation curriculum. However, I do not find that the effects varied by race/ethnicity or immigrant generation; that is, the relationships hold for all students rather than for Latino immigrants in particular. Thus, school incorporation is not appropriately labeled a mechanism for immigrant incorporation per se.",

        "description":"The compatibility of school choice policies and educational equity goals is one of the most hotly debated issues in education today. Yet, despite the growing population of children of immigrants in US schools, limited research exists on the relationship between parental nativity and participation in school choice from an equity perspective. This article explores the tensions and alignment between school choice and equity through an examination of children of Latin American immigrants' search for and decisions about high schools in the context of a compulsory choice policy. Drawing on nearly 2 years of ethnographic data collected at one New York City public middle school and interviews with 26 first- and second-generation children of low-income immigrants from across Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, I illuminate some of challenges that Latino immigrant-origin students faced in understanding how to select appropriate, quality high schools. Using these findings, I analyze the ways in which the design and implementation of New York City's mandatory high school choice policy hindered its equity potential and offer recommendations for its improvement.",

        "description":"Over the past half century, law and policy have helped cement tremendous inequities into the structure of our cities. District boundary lines separating multiple, unequal school systems within a single metropolitan (metro) area play a central role in structuring racial and economic isolation. Using data from the National Center for Education Statistics, this study explores how patterns of school segregation are linked to desegregation policy and district boundary arrangements in four southern metro areas. Findings indicate that while city-suburban mergers create far more potential for meaningful school desegregation within a school system, simply eliminating district boundaries is not enough. Corresponding and well-designed school desegregation policy is necessary to achieve widespread integration of students. In a society growing more diverse even as its schools remain very separate, lessons from this study provide new insight into strategies that will help return our society to fulfilling the goals of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education.&quot;",

        "description":"In many urban districts, the public education landscape is being transformed as private-sector providers such as educational management organizations, charter management organizations, and partner support organizations partner with or run district schools. While some private-sector providers&apos; visions for school reform have remained static over time, others&apos; have changed due to factors like the evolving policy environment, changes in local contexts, or new direction in the providers&apos; own agendas. This article creates a framework that places these private-sector players on a continuum of control. Such a continuum captures the variety of providers in the field examining different attributes that can contribute to the likely success or failure of a partnership. Particularly for practitioners, it captures the varying degrees of support and loss of control that collaboration with an outside provider might entail.",

The specific reform highlighted is a comprehensive family and community engagement approach developed by researchers at the National Network of Partnership Schools (NNPS). The study&apos;s findings suggest that district leaders facilitated principals&apos; effective implementation of the NNPS reform by creating clear expectations, establishing coherent contexts, and providing tangible supports and rewards. Over time, these actions reduced resistance and increased buy-in among school leaders. Implications of these findings for education research and reform development are discussed.",

Multilevel models show that students with higher individual engagement tend to experience larger math achievement growth over kindergarten, that classroom engagement makes a difference in how much achievement growth students experience over kindergarten, and that students with higher individual engagement benefit more from being in highly-engaged classrooms than children with lower individual engagement. Students with higher math test scores at kindergarten entry also benefit more from highly-engaged classrooms than children with lower prior math scores. Results from this study provide new evidence that behavioral engagement affects students&apos; achievement growth on multiple levels, with the individual, the classroom environment, and the interaction of the individual and classroom environment all relating to math outcomes.

Using principal-agent theory, with its focus on goal alignment and the use of incentives, we explore how PMs operated in ways distinct from traditional district offices in Denver, New Orleans, and Los Angeles. We consider how PMs identify the goals of multiple principals, incentivize and monitor agents around principals' goals, and select and develop agents who can meet principals' goals. Drawing on 76 system-level interviews, we find that PMs in each city confronted similar tensions around PM responsibilities but addressed them differently. Specifically, we observed distinct PM approaches to managing competing goals of stakeholders in the context of school closure and to balancing school-based autonomy with more prescriptive measures for building school capacity and ensuring the equitable treatment of students.",

To better understand this rhetoric, we tracked its appearance in five prominent print outlets from 1984 to 2016. By distinguishing between arguments about local schools and the nation's schools, we found that discussions of &quot;failing schools&quot; surged first as a claim about the nation's schools and then as a claim about local schools. But, whereas the discussion of national failure featured a narrowed set of arguments, the subsequent discussion of local failure was composed more broadly. Thus, we describe a rhetorical echo, wherein the discussion of local failure acquired the shape and intensity of the preceding national discussion, while taking on the particulars of community context. A national narrative frame shaped the telling of local stories.",

We estimate a series of regression models and find that school supports and characteristics of teacher partnerships were significant predictors of the frequency of collaborative activities, focus on instructional activities, and perceptions of IPI as beneficial. Commonalities among partner teachers like subject/grade taught were also associated with teachers' perceptions of IPI as beneficial.

We conduct an online survey experiment in which participants choose between the five largest districts in a metropolitan area. All participants receive demographic data for each district, but some are randomly assigned to receive achievement and/or growth data as well.

However, these fixed characteristics of teachers are only proxies for the quality of teaching, which may vary within teacher by the different classrooms they teach. Research Methods/Approach: Using data from the Measures of Effective Teaching (MET) project, we consider various sources of within-teacher, across-classroom variation of teaching effectiveness using a teacher fixed-effects modeling approach and highlight those that may, on average, disadvantage youth of color. Findings: We find that (1) about half of the variation in classroom teaching efficacy is within teachers, (2) classrooms taught by the same teacher with higher percentages of Black and Latinx students receive lower quality of teaching, and (3) these patterns are consistent across teacher racial/ethnic groups. A number of plausible explanations of this association are considered, including rater biases on observational measures and differences in teaching practices; we also consider how these variations differ by teacher race. Implications: Our findings highlight the importance of teachers' in-classroom practices, not simply their credentials, in educational research, policy, and practice targeted at reducing racial inequality.",

        "description":"Purpose: This article examines the relationship between teacher unionization and the academic performance of students in districts of varying socioeconomic status (SES). We aim to answer the following research questions: Do union effects vary with the SES of districts? Are these effects more (or less) pronounced in high-SES, mid-SES, or low-SES districts? Research Methods/Approach: We merge two nationally representative data sets from the United States: the School and Staffing Survey and the Stanford Education Data Archive. We measure union strength with the presence of collective bargaining contracts (CB) or meet-and-confer agreements (MC). We employ propensity score matching. Considering CB (MC) as a treatment, we define districts with CB (MC) as the treated units and no agreement districts as the nontreated units. Findings: We find that middle-class districts with CB agreements had higher average test scores, in all grades and both math and English, than did districts with similar propensity scores but no CB agreement in place. Neither low-SES nor high-SES districts exhibited significant effects of CB on math or English scores. The pattern in MC effects is quite similar. MC agreements are correlated with higher scores in both subjects in all grades in middle-class districts. Implications: Our results indicate generally positive effects of teachers' unions on student performance on standardized tests. Moreover, these positive effects are concentrated in middle-class US school districts. A decline in the ability of teachers to organize may therefore have differentially negative effects on the outcomes of students in these districts.",

This article details trends in the segregation of Latino children enrolled in elementary schools, 2000-2015, then examines how evolving patterns differ among the nation's school districts. Research Methods: We compiled enrollment data from schools, merging census data on the demographic and economic attributes of residents inside the boundaries of each district. Changes in the interaction and entropy measures of segregation are reported, illuminating levels of Latino segregation between districts and among schools within districts. Findings: Latino children were less likely to attend elementary schools with White peers in 2015 relative to 2000, stemming in part from growing Latino enrollments. The isolation of Latino children within certain schools inside districts did not change on average. Local variation in segregation levels is associated with the income of residents within districts, along with their nativity and home language. Just 13% of the nation's districts enroll sufficient counts of Latino and White children to advance integration among constituent schools. Implications: Rising Latino enrollment in once lily-white schools does advance racial integration. But many Latino children enter increasingly segregated school districts in which poor students are isolated from middle-class peers. In the absence of interdistrict integration efforts, little progress to integrate Latino children will be possible.",

        "description":"Purpose: This multiple comparative case study investigated district and high school leaders' framing mechanisms and discourses around priorities and challenges to understand their equity aims and their preparation of diverse student populations' college, career, and civic readiness. Research Methods/Approach: This research used framing theory to examine semistructured interviews and focus groups with 34 educational leaders from four sample schools with above average percentages of Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, and/or economically disadvantaged students. Three positive outlier schools were sampled as they achieved statistically significantly better graduation outcomes, whereas the comparison typical school performed as predicted. Findings: Positive outlier leaders coupled diagnostic and prognostic framing to address priorities and challenges while advancing an equity-oriented agenda. In addition, the positive outlier leaders' discourses prioritized local needs and values, contextual challenges, and organizational learning. Furthermore, positive outlier leaders used a hybrid frame (motivational, normative, and regulatory) to emphasize academic achievement and student needs in service of improving outcomes for diverse students. In these schools, these hybrid discourses amount to a normative frame: &quot;the way we do things around here.&quot; In contrast, typical school leaders framed a narrower agenda focused on compliance-oriented discourses structured by policy regulations, and these acted as the primary motivators for action. Implications: Understanding framing mechanisms and discourses has import for educational leaders' practices as they make sense of improvement efforts for underserved youth. Leaders' frames and discourses may provide a consequential improvement mechanism for schools and entire districts caught in suboptimal organizational patterns and behavioral routines.",

The purpose of this sequential explanatory mixed-methods study was: (1) to affirm the link between CE and student achievement; (2) to understand the antecedents of CE; and (3) to illustrate how school leaders shape conditions to promote CE. Research Methods/Approach: Using statewide data drawn from a stratified random sample of schools, analyses were conducted utilizing hierarchical generalized linear modeling. To probe the relationship between CE and student achievement, two high-poverty schools, differentiated by levels of CE and student performance, were selected for case studies. Findings: Quantitative results confirm CE was related to fourth-grade students' odds of passing state standardized assessments in reading and mathematics. Case studies revealed principals created structures that enhanced instructional program coherence, which may have enriched CE. Implications: These findings underscore the importance in leadership in supporting CE. Specifically, leaders foster the conditions to enact an instructional framework that serves as an opportunity to not only build CE but also articulate CE beliefs.",

Examining a sample of 100 teachers, we calculated the resource homogeneity of teacher pairs over 1,029 online sites. Results indicated teachers' organizational context significantly contributed to their likelihood to share resources from same online sites, including school and district affiliations. Furthermore, of those similar teachers, the degree of similarity was affected by particular traits, including grade level taught, experience level, and disposition toward teaching. This may inform researchers and educators as they attempt to understand teachers' contexts and motivations for supplemental resource curation.",

It examines how presidents strategically frame organizational events in ways that help constituents make sense of their actions. Using archival and qualitative methods, I examine executive sensegiving strategies in the presidential communiqués of university magazines from eight tuition-driven universities during a 15-year period (2000-2014). Data revealed presidents employed three strategies--foundational, configurational, and transformational--driven by connecting different cues (i.e., events) with frames (i.e., institutional logics). Although prior literature has described actors draw on logics as a &quot;toolkit,&quot; this study illuminates how they modify those &quot;tools&quot; over time. In the transformational strategy, university leaders engaged in boundary work, acting as &quot;institutional entrepreneurs&quot; to change the microfoundations--or core elements--of an institutional logic over time and especially the meanings associated with its symbols and language.",

Students, teachers, and administrators were interviewed to learn how they use these SNSs to support a variety of functions in the school setting, including professional development, classroom learning, self-directed learning, and socializing. Participants also were asked about how they use SNSs more generally and points of overlap between personal and school-related uses. Findings show that although instructional use is low, SNSs nonetheless have a pervasive presence in the school. Being highly connected has both advantages and disadvantages for students and teachers alike. For individuals with poor social connections, the heavy use of SNSs can result in greater disconnection from school-related information and social circles. Implications show opportunities for selecting classroom learning tools, developing digital literacy and citizenship curricula, and supporting all members of the school community.",

By examining the relationship between student capital and OTL, we call attention to the role of schools in providing differential learning experiences to students, which helps to explain disparate achievement outcomes. Findings support the cultural reproduction perspective by demonstrating that students who have more access to normative education-based resources outside of school and academically aligned social networks tend to report more opportunities for problem solving and student-oriented instruction during math lessons.

Using a sample of Midwestern elementary teachers, this work identifies patterns of online educational resource access over 4 years across 135,000 pins shared within Pinterest, a social media platform. Results indicate teachers most often turn to one another for resources and professional materials. This may have implications for trust developed within teacherpreneurial guilds and teachers' ability to exert agency within their profession.",

        "description":"Purpose: For decades, federal and state agencies have identified teacher shortages in high-needs endorsement areas (HNEAs), including science, mathematics, and special education, as a critical problem. Many states have implemented policies and practices to recruit HNEA teachers, but little is known about how their workforce outcomes compare with other teachers. Research Methods: We leverage statewide longitudinal data in Tennessee to analyze the workforce outcomes of teachers prepared in the state between 2010 and 2016. We model our outcomes of interest using linear and logistic multilevel regression. Findings: We observe that the number of teachers who receive HNEA endorsements has increased over time even as the overall number of teachers prepared in the state has declined. HNEA teachers are employed at higher rates and retained at similar rates as other teachers. HNEA teachers have similar student achievement gains as non-HNEA teachers. Though HNEA and non-HNEA teachers also have similar first-year observation ratings, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and special education teachers improve at slower rates subsequently. Implications: Our results suggest that potential policy solutions to the recruitment, retention, and development of highly effective HNEA teachers might require policies targeted to individual HNEAs, as each area might have unique needs and challenges. The positive results on preparation and employment of HNEA teachers suggest that Tennessee's policies to train, employ, and retain HNEA teachers have been largely successful. However, our findings also suggest that HNEA teachers may need additional supports in instructional development.",

        "description":"Purpose: On average, one in five high school students in North Carolina fails at least one core, required course every year. After failure, students have two options to regain course credit: repeat the course face-to-face (F2F) or online credit recovery (OCR). This study seeks to provide descriptive evidence on OCR/F2F enrollment patterns over time and across schools. Research Methods: The data include administrative records from the state of North Carolina on all high school students enrolled in public schools between the 2012-13 and 2016-17 school years. Analyses are descriptive with ordinary least squares regression and multilevel models. Findings: OCR has grown in popularity: schools, on average, were as likely to enroll students in OCR as F2F courses by 2015-16. Increasing high school graduation rates and decreasing test score proficiency are correlated with increasing OCR enrollment at the school level. Students with more absences and Black students are more likely to enroll in OCR, and students with disabilities are less likely to enroll. OCR enrollment is associated with a 12 percentage point increase in the probability of earning course credit over F2F courses, although this could indicate students more likely to earn course credit are assigned to OCR. Implications: School leaders should consider how they assign students to OCR/F2F given the findings indicating OCR enrollment could come with intended benefits for credit earning but unintended negative consequences for test scores. Future research could explore these processes to understand the most effective uses of OCR for student remediation of course credit.",

        "description":"Purpose: As the federal government has retreated from taking a dominant role in encouraging implementation of common K-12 standards, states and districts have moved to fill this education policy vacuum. This study aims to understand how state and district leaders are navigating this new policy environment. Research Methods/Approach: Drawing upon 47 interviews with state and district administrators conducted in 2016 and 2017, we used deductive coding based on a policy attributes theory to examine the co-occurrence of codes for specificity, consistency, authority, power, and stability. Throughout this process, we assessed interrater reliability through paired coding, research team discussions, and recoding to uncover broad themes. Findings: We identify the concept of &quot;smart power&quot; as a ubiquitous mechanism that leaders are utilizing to balance buy-in (authority) and accountability (power). We find that this balance remains precarious and highly dependent upon local political contexts. Smart power can allow for more thoughtful and sustainable implementation strategies that increase teacher support for these policies--or it can become a rhetorical device without substantive change. Implications: We reveal the enduring appeal of accountability policies even when administrators express reservations about falling back on the legacy of No Child Left Behind. These findings hold broad relevance for the implementation of K-12 standards moving forward, particularly as states consider how to build legitimacy and buy-in toward new and revised standards-based policies in the wake of the pandemic.",

We examine how educational leaders and educators in two rural school districts in western Pennsylvania made sense of growing opioid misuse as not only a social problem but also a local problem, and how that framing in turn shaped their community and school response. Research Methods/Approach: We analyze data gathered from interviews and fieldwork conducted in two rural school districts in Pennsylvania in 2017-18 experiencing high levels of opioid misuse and drug overdose. Data were drawn from interviews with 36 educators and educational leaders, as well as notes from roughly 60 hours of participant observation in each district at school board meetings, local action group meetings, and community events. Findings: We find that community and institutional forces restricted coherent and meaningful school responses. School district leaders understood growing opioid misuse as emerging both external to and in contradiction with local rural community values and identity. Educators further cited testing assessment pressures and lack of educator training as institutional factors limiting school and educator responses to the mounting opioid problem. Implications: Despite a precedent for schools assuming a variety of health and wellness functions for students and families, and the severity of opioid misuse as a government-defined statewide emergency, coherent school response to opioid addiction is often stymied by a number of social, cultural, and institutional constraints.",

To better understand these measures, we examine the stability of estimated school-by-grade effects across 2 years using large-scale survey data. Research Methods: We use 3 years of student SEL survey data from five large urban school districts in California, student-level demographic information, and summative assessment scores in math and English language arts (ELA) to estimate 2 years of growth measures (i.e., 2015-16 and 2016-17) with school fixed effects included to estimate schools' contributions to student growth in SEL, math, and ELA. We compute the growth measures separately by grade and by year. We then estimate correlations of the school effects between the same grades in the two different years, as well as between adjacent grades for a given cohort. Findings: We find that schools in the top or bottom of the effect distribution have more persistent impacts across years than do those in the middle. Correlations among effects in the same grades across years are positive but lower than those for math and ELA. Implications: The results provide some evidence that school effect estimates based on student surveys measure actual contributions to students' SEL; however, the low stability of estimated school effects draws into question including the measures in school performance systems. Using the estimates to identify particularly effective schools is more promising.",

We use social network data and interviews conducted with about 70 school and district leaders within the NIC to examine changes in the organizational infrastructure that maintained or changed network features. Our findings indicate that, upon the withdrawal of external supports, the network constricted, though core network features were maintained. However, changes to the infrastructure, such as a reliance on teacher-leaders and a focus on school-level empowerment, present challenges to the long-term sustainability of the NIC.",

In this environment, coaches often face conflicting demands between their educative duties to develop teachers and their reform-oriented responsibilities to implement district policy. Coaches can wield facets of teacher evaluation to promote coherent instructional improvement. Drawing on interview data from 41 coaches across five educational systems, we apply the micropolitics perspective to examine coaches' work as they navigate the intersection of teacher evaluation and instructional improvement. Our findings elucidate two major micropolitical strategies: convergence and divergence. In particular, coaches frequently converged their work with evaluation around goal setting and observation feedback, facilitating teachers' and administrators' understanding of the evaluation system and instructional reform. Conversely, coaches tended to separate issues of teachers' formal ratings from their coaching. Our analysis reveals details on coaches' political role and illuminates benefits and limitations of coaches' involvement in evaluation.",

Although scholars have addressed underrepresentation of women and racial minorities in law schools and the legal profession, they tend to examine gender and race separately. This study is a critical quantitative analysis of law school admissions among women of color. Research Methods/Approach: We use an intersectionality framework, weighted effect coding, marginal effects, predicted probabilities, and multilevel models to examine admissions data from 25 public law schools. Findings: Unlike Black men, Black women did not receive the full strength of the independent positive relationship between being Black and law school admission, and their access to legal education varies across institutional rankings. Implications: These findings provide quantitative evidence for the importance of the concept of intersectionality--not just for examining multiple individual identities but also how intersected identities matter during selective admissions processes across institutional rankings.",

As well as revealing how professional capital exists in three dimensions--human, social, and decisional--the research argues professional capital also needs to be understood as inherently political. Research Methods/Approach: The research draws upon interviews and discussions with key educators who developed and supported the Next Generation Science Standards at state and national levels. Findings: The article reveals political capital as vital for promoting educational standards reform, managing perceptions of reform, and making pragmatic decisions to ground reform in context. Political capital is a complex, contingent capacity vital to the development and acceptance of science education reform. Implications: Findings have implications for understanding power dynamics that characterize reform in schooling systems and professional contexts more broadly.",

        "description":"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the &quot;responsiveness&quot; of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years, as well as students' responses to questions administered in the district's 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students' ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students' eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits.",

Research Methods: We interviewed 13 practicing equity directors and analyzed artifacts such as meeting minutes, equity policies, equity mission statements, job descriptions, and organizational charts. Findings: Directors experienced structural and psychological vulnerabilities depending on how their districts structured the role with positional power, resources, and authority to carry out their leadership work. Equity directors' roles were often ambiguous and at times misaligned to the expected leadership tasks. Institutionalized racial and gender oppression compounded the vulnerabilities of the role. Implications: To realize the full potential of this new district leadership position, districts must attend not only to what they expect equity directors to accomplish but also to the configurations of the role as it intersects with labor-related racial and gender oppression in districts.",

Research Methods/Approach: We conducted 56 semistructured interviews in 2019 with state-level stakeholders across five states. Findings: We found that policy actors generally viewed White families as strong and racially minoritized families as weak. However, for both groups, we found variation in whether these constructions were positive or negative and differences between students and parents. We find that social constructions are fluid, with varying, sometimes conflicting and contradictory views of racially minoritized and White parents in the same period, within the same state context. Despite the salience of race throughout social constructions of the target population, policy actors primarily used color-evasive references. In general, we found little variation in policy components at the state level. Implications: Our work demonstrates how racialized social constructions matter for equity in school-choice policy, with implications for local, state, and federal policy and for future research.",

Framed by concepts from existing scholarship on school board effectiveness, cultural responsiveness, and the opportunity gap, this article critically explores how school boards address policies and practices related to the education of English learners (ELs). Based on interview and archival data, findings from this qualitative case study show how one school board reactively engaged in the development and implementation of EL-related policies and practices. These findings also reflect areas of tension among the school board that resulted in resistance and reconciliation over issues of race, equity, and deficit-based perspectives on ELs. In conclusion, I offer the metaphor of the foghorn as a guide for school boards to actively seek expertise, willingly shift perspectives, and patiently maintain a commitment in their path toward educational equity.",

In the first study of charter school effects on the full range of charter school students in North Carolina, we find that, in general, charter school performance has improved over time, although often it continues to remain lower than traditional public school achievement.

        "description":"We investigate student mobility in a choice-based system that has gone to scale, New Orleans, to gain insight into an underlying improvement mechanism of choice-based reform and its potential equity-related consequences. In contrast to typical analyses of mobility, this study distinguishes incumbent school characteristics that can cause students to search for a new school (&quot;push&quot; factors) from those features that can draw families to a new school (&quot;pull&quot; factors). We find evidence consistent with school performance playing both push and pull roles. However, for low-achieving students, the push of low performance at incumbent schools is stronger than the pull of high performance at potential destinations, implying that low-achieving students are more successful in exiting low-performing schools than they are in finding higher-performing schools to attend.",

This straightforward sequence is actually quite challenging.

From data on nine cohort members' thinking, the study distills a set of heuristics frequently deployed: defining problems as the absence of preferred solutions, conceiving of change as filling an empty vessel, understanding learning as implementing, aiming at conventions, and seeing &quot;rationality&quot; in adopting &quot;what works.&quot;",

We argue that performing collaborative research with students and parents can better inform curriculum design decisions, particularly for communities whose identities, knowledge(s), and ways of being have been historically marginalized. Building from the culturally responsive curriculum literature, we have developed a culturally grounded curriculum development approach. We illustrate the approach through discussing a case of its development and implementation with an educational nongovernmental organization (NGO) that provides access to secondary school for Quechua (Indigenous) young women in Peru. This article reflexively reports the process of the NGO's collaborative inquiry project to cocreate meaningful educational opportunities with the students and parents. We then discuss dilemmas of interpretation that arose when incorporating community voices into curricular decisions, and how the collaborative curriculum approach can apply to formal and nonformal learning spaces in other contexts.",

I use observational data from 6 months of debate practices and competitions with two teams in the Chicago Debate League, as well as interviews with 12 debaters and 2 coaches, to show that debate participation can contribute to participants' acquisition of two forms of cultural capital. I argue that debaters demonstrate dominant cultural capital through demanding critical feedback and analyzing complex ideas. I further document how debaters develop &quot;adaptive cultural capital,&quot; or cultural capital that dominant institutions demand of them but that is not required of members of dominant social groups. Here, adaptive cultural capital is illustrated through debaters' ability to face failure with resilience. These findings contribute to sociological understandings of how schools influence students' acquisition of diverse forms of cultural capital.",

This study uses data from 52 qualitative interviews to systematically examine how educators working in different types of urban schools and neighborhoods make sense of their interactions with external organizations. The findings contribute to scholarship on school-community partnerships by demonstrating that neighborhood organizations provide unique benefits to educators, brokering relationships between the school and the community and generating opportunities for the co-creation of resources by educators and community members. Furthermore, the study shows that educators' sense-making about the local organizational landscape is related both to the availability of geographically proximate organizations and to where students and families reside.",

Recent evidence suggests that such funding can improve educational outcomes; however, unexplained heterogeneity in the relationship between resources and outcomes has led to calls for research on the processes by which resources translate into instructional improvement. In responding to this call, this case study unmasks the complex processes by which funding and other resources are translated into opportunities for science-specific professional learning and the intervening resources that mediate that translation. Results reveal that organizational structures and policies, including aligned schedules, cored math and science teachers, substitute teacher availability, and initiative alignment, played a central role in facilitating or impeding professional learning opportunities. However, each of these organizational structures was in turn facilitated by other elements of capacity, including external funding and resources in the cultural (e.g., shared vision) and social (e.g., relationships) dimensions.",

Drawing on prior research on inequalities among immigrant students, we find evidence that individual background characteristics, social capital, school and instructional contexts, and stereotypes and bias all contribute to variation in reclassification patterns.

A heterogeneity analysis was then conducted to explore subgroup findings. Lastly, qualitative data were collected from survey and interviews and integrated with the quantitative results to identify points of convergence and divergence. Across the different modes of analyses, administrative support, strong connection with students, and self-confidence were identified as most salient for respondents' consideration of teaching employment at the hard-to-staff district.

We use interview, focus group, and observation data from nearly 200 participants to document variability in the way SROs conceptualize and are involved in discipline as well as how such involvement is shaped by context. Although 79% of SROs initially report not being involved in discipline, we find that the majority involve themselves in nuanced ways that are shaped by relationships with school staff, official policies, and the characteristics of students served.

        "description":"This article studies socioeconomic inequalities in educational attainment in 21 European countries for cohorts born between 1925 and 1989, and asks the question whether reforms to track students later in the school career have reduced inequalities. Country fixed effects models show that inequalities by parental occupational class were reduced after policies were implemented that separated children for different school careers at a later age (i.e., postponed between-school tracking). The association between parents' education and children's attainment is hardly affected by reforms to later tracking. The results remained after taking into account the political climate preceding reforms, and were also highly robust to the selection of countries. A reduction of inequality was achieved through a loss of attainment by the children of advantaged backgrounds. Political implications and the relevance of these findings for American debates are discussed.",

        "description":"Early Career Teacher (ECT) turnover is a critical issue; the teacher turnover rate is significantly higher among ECTs as compared with experienced teachers, and they are more likely to fill vacancies in hard-to-staff schools. This study examines how principal leadership might affect ECT turnover by using a large-scale, nationally representative data set, the Beginning Teacher Longitudinal Survey (BTLS). Using a discrete survival analysis, the author showed that ECT turnover in terms of leaving one's school was indeed substantial. More importantly, principal leadership had a consistent negative association with the odds of ECTs leaving their school during the first five years. Among various aspects of principal leadership, principal leadership related to student behavior management had the strongest association with ECT turnover. In contrast, the association between principal leadership and ECTs leaving the profession was not significant. This study provides empirical evidence of the importance of principal leadership in reducing ECT turnover.",

        "description":"Education researchers and political scientists have long raised theoretical objections to market-based reforms like school choice on the grounds that these policies may undermine public participation in democratic politics and erode public support for public institutions like schools. Little work, however, has empirically tested this claim. Drawing on a unique dataset of 191 off-cycle school bond elections in Michigan school districts between 2005 and 2017, this paper employs regression modeling to test whether voter turnout and school bond passage rates are lower in districts where school choice exit participation is high. Results show that a 1 percentage point increase in a district's school choice participation rate is associated with a 1% decline in voter turnout in that district's school bond elections. This result is statistically significant even when controlling for other community and election characteristics associated with voter turnout. However, differential relationships are revealed for exit via charter schools and exit via interdistrict public school choice. The data do not reveal a significant relationship between school choice and the odds of bond passage on election day.",

For students suspended before the reform, classroom disorder OSS decreased and attendance (but not academic achievement) improved following the reform. Postreform changes in peer outcomes varied with school-level implementation: in schools that eliminated classroom disorder OSS, peer math achievement and attendance were unaffected, whereas peer math achievement declined and attendance decreased in schools that did not fully implement the district-level reform.",

We use qualitative research techniques to analyze the websites of 151 school-turnaround providers that have been endorsed, either directly or indirectly, by 13 state education agencies with publicly available lists of providers. In addition, we conduct a systematic review of the research evidence behind each provider, finding that the types of providers and the services that they purport offering vary considerably. Approximately 50% of providers indicate being research based, but 11% have evidence of impact on student achievement outcomes generally, and only 5% in turnaround contexts specifically.

Yet little is known about how leaders of ideologically progressive charter schools sustain their founding pedagogical and political missions amid widespread market values. This qualitative case study of one progressive charter school in New York City investigates this phenomenon. Findings demonstrate that the school's enrollment, instructional, school governance, and community engagement practices moved toward market values as school leaders and board trustees prioritized attaining favorable test outcomes, garnering resources, and ensuring the renewal of the school's charter. Findings illustrate a neoliberal grammar of schooling, or powerful forces that led school leaders to move their practices toward market values, in turn constraining the realization of the school's founding progressive mission.",

In the case of &quot;portfolio&quot; systems, advocates argue that choice, performance-based accountability, and autonomy challenge traditional schooling and foster a diversity of options for parents. Yet there is limited empirical evidence on these claims. Our mixed-methods study examines the values and reported practices of schools in Los Angeles. We find limited evidence of variation across schools. Rather, institutional forces appear to be shaping common commitments to academics, whole child support, community, and professionalism, with some fine-grained differences connected to organizational characteristics. Ultimately, this lack of diversity and the complexity of multiple logics do not appear to challenge the idea of a shared &quot;grammar of schooling&quot; across schools.

As PBL gains momentum in K-12 classrooms, we need to better understand the ways in which teachers and students take up these opportunities. This case study explored how one third-grade teacher's enactment of a PBL curriculum provided opportunities for students to learn and use social-emotional skills and literacy in the service of disciplinary learning. Findings revealed that the curriculum and enactment diverged from the grammar of schooling by providing opportunities for students to use literacy as a tool for disciplinary inquiry while simultaneously advancing goals associated with social-emotional learning.",

The conventional relational grammar involves teachers and students connecting to pursue academic learning--a grammar rooted in both historic attempts to define the professional domain of teaching as the transmission of academic knowledge as well as current efforts to &quot;learnify&quot; education. This study describes 154 student-teacher relationships experienced by three high school teachers in a Midwest middle college to depict a revised relational grammar. Encouraged to reimagine teaching as academic and nonacademic support-giving, the Lincoln teachers exhibited a relational grammar based on knowing students as learners and also deeply as people and giving nonacademic support as much as or more than academic support, with implications for equity.",

This study applies critical discourse methodologies to evaluate policies from districts bordering reservations, districts geographically distant from reservations, and districts located on reservations. Broadly, the study addresses the question, How do school admission policies perpetuate settler-colonialism? Findings reveal bordertown discourse that excludes Indigenous epistemologies, restricts self-determination, and defines the function of knowledge and peoples to reinforce Eurocentric power structures. The study offers implications for policy makers, district leaders, and community members working to enhance equity, particularly given increased pressure for school choice expansion.",

However, these students have not been extensively studied, and the factors that affect reengagement decisions are not well understood. Using an educational resilience framework and the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, we investigate the factors that predict returning to high school after a dropout episode as well as specific types of return pathways. We find factors related to academic effort, including attendance and ninth-grade GPA, to be the most strongly associated with returning to school after dropout episodes. We find that students who expect to finish school tend to do so, even after a dropout episode. Other aspects of educational resilience, including personal attributes and environmental factors, did not contribute to explaining dropouts' return to school.",

Initial high-tech cachet surrounding the option stimulated statewide spread in enrollments, but over time growth in student flows became more pronounced among disadvantaged, lower tax-base public school districts. As mass media coverage shifted to a research-substantiated narrative of the model's academic ineffectiveness, cyber charter enrollments declined first in districts with higher parent educational attainment and then intensified. With the large movement of students, the mean amount of public funds transferred from residential districts in 2014 was about $800,000 (standard deviation about $3,100,000). With dubious academic benefits, districts with the lowest tax base lost significant revenue to cyber charter providers.",

We discuss how community-based organizations in Philadelphia responded to the challenges of this new landscape by adapting their tactics and strategies. Adaptations include reconceptualizing targets, identifying new targets, retooling premises and strategies for building coalitions, cultivating new constituencies, entwining community education with community-based action, and making equity and community engagement central to the platforms of candidates for elective office.

Anthony Giddens's theory of structuration provides a useful framework for understanding how tracking is enacted and how its inequities might be interrupted.

Using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System, we observed 26 teachers in low- and high-track classrooms in spring 2012. We found that teachers, on the whole, structured generative rules that communicated lower expectations and provided less support to students in low-track classes than they did to those in high-track classes. However, we also found that a small number of teachers structured supportive environments for low-track students, suggesting implications for the transformation points of tracking.",

However, research that seeks to estimate the effects of suspensions on student outcomes rarely accounts for the preexisting differences that distinguish students who are and are not suspended. Using quasi-experimental methods and longitudinal data from New York City, we estimated the associations between suspension and academic outcomes and found that, even with more sophisticated methods, the negative relationships between suspension and outcomes persist. Specifically, we found that suspended students had weaker attendance, course completion rates, and standardized test scores; were more likely to drop out; and were less likely to graduate within 4, 5, or 6 years.",

The differences between these students and those who choose private school are compelling education outcomes in their own right. To illustrate the argument, I analyze data from a small and little-known private school scholarship lottery in Charlotte, North Carolina, that occurred prior to the 1999-2000 academic year. I show that race, family structure, employment status, and religion significantly predict the decision to refuse a voucher offer, as does student admission into a specific school of choice. I argue that models of voucher effects on student achievement are interpretable only in the context of factors underlying the ability to choose in the first place.",

Applying hierarchical linear models with an instrumental variable method, the study disentangles age effect and grade effect on growth and accounts for both international and interstate variations. Math achievement gains between grades 4 and 8 are significant with positive age and grade effects and negative age-by-grade interaction. The study finds convergence of the age effect and divergence of the grade effect among the nations and states. While the United States lags further behind East Asian nations in math achievement during middle school years, a few of the U.S. states match East Asian gains. The initial or widening gap between the U.S. states and East Asian countries is more closely related to school factors, whereas family factors play a greater explanatory role for achievement gaps among the U.S. states.",

        "description":"There is evidence suggesting that missing school negatively relates to academic achievement. However, it is a difficult task to derive unbiased empirical estimates of absences in their influence on performance. One particular challenge arises from the unobserved heterogeneity in the family environment, which may relate to both absence behavior and school performance. This article provides the first analysis aimed at reducing the family-specific omitted variable bias pertaining to measures of absences in their influence on standardized testing achievement. It does so by employing a model of family fixed effects on a longitudinal sample of siblings within the same household in a large urban school district over six years of observations. The results indicate a stronger, statistically significant negative relationship between absences and achievement than what would have been suggested otherwise. Implications are discussed.

        "description":"This study investigates the cross-national institutionalization of English as a regular school subject over the past century and discusses how the rise of English as a global language in today's curricular policy models around the world reflects an expansive conception of supranational citizenship. Our extensive comparative and historical data suggest that substantive societal characteristics of individual countries have played fairly insignificant roles in the rapid diffusion of English language education, especially in the past half century. This result sheds light on the institutionalist perspective in which the worldwide spread of English language education is understood to reflect universalistic nation-state purposes and principles of education that emphasize the empowerment of the individual in global society.

We content analyzed the coverage of New Jersey education policy debates during 1985, when the governor moved to consolidate his power in the education field. We used quantitative framing and conflict analysis and found that the media presented educational policy debates in ways that advantaged political and economic elites and portrayed the governor as being above the political fray. On the whole, our findings conform more to Bourdieu's social fields theory than to pluralist theory. (Contains 18 notes, 4 tables and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"Expanding the sources of leadership in schools has been a reform theme since the mid 1980s. Using exploratory factor analysis and regression, we examine the following questions: (1) How does leadership style affect principals' openness to community involvement? (2) Is a principal's openness to community involvement related to student achievement? And (3) How are participatory and shared school leadership structures related to student learning? We base our analysis on a 2005-6 principal survey (N = 157) and a teacher survey (N = 4.491) from a Wallace Foundation-funded study, Learning from Leadership, augmented by available state 2005-6 math achievement data. Our results show that principals with more diverse leadership teams are more open to community involvement. Also, teachers' perceptions of greater parent involvement are positively associated with student math achievement. The article highlights how principals and teachers can better organize their efforts to involve stakeholders for increasing student achievement.",

Findings suggest that elements of middle school social integration, including teacher bonding, popularity, and extracurricular participation, affect academic achievement when students enter high school.

The results consistently indicated that all types of students benefit more in later grades from being in small classes in early grades. These positive effects are significant through grade 8. Longer periods in small classes produced higher increases in achievement in later grades for all types of students. For certain grades, in reading and science, low achievers seem to benefit more from being in small classes for longer periods. It appears that the lasting benefits of the cumulative effects of small classes may reduce the achievement gap in reading and science in some of the later grades.",

It is also neighborhood and community. Using two conceptions of geography--space and place--I investigate how and when geography factored into parents' thinking. Drawing on spatial analyses of parents' choice sets, the schools within two miles of their homes, and longitudinal in-depth interviews, I describe a range of ways in which geography shaped 36 parents' choices of middle and high schools in Detroit. Parents considered a small fraction of the schools near their homes; however, all the parents discussed geographic characteristics of schools. The role geography played in the choice process ranged from nonexistent to framing. By investigating how parents' geographic preferences played out with respect to their other preferences and the existing supply of schools, this study contributes to the field's increasingly nuanced understanding of parents' decision making.

Overall, while both test scores and race explain home prices, we found that the influence of tests declined while race became nearly seven times more influential over our decade-long period of study. Our interpretation of the results draws on the shifting context of school accountability, the Internet, and racial dynamics in this suburb over time. (Contains 12 notes, 9 tables, and 4 figures.)",

        "description":"There has been a great deal of research into school choice and the education quasi-market that has dominated compulsory school provision in the United Kingdom since the early 1980s. Much of this research fails to address the context in which processes of choice exist alongside the patterns and outcomes of choice and competition, leading to considerable dispute within UK debates on the impact of school choice. The apparent contradiction can be bridged by focusing on the geographic particularities of the education market at various scales. This article examines one urban education market in the United Kingdom. In mapping the context and patterns of school choice and competition, the article begins to offer new insights into understanding recent trends in social segregation between schools. Such an approach to studying the impact of open enrollment and the marketization of compulsory schooling represents a necessary shift toward the development of a geography of school choice.

        "description":"We examine whether student enrollment in nonneighborhood schools changes levels of racial segregation in public schools across urban school districts by comparing the racial composition of schools and their corresponding attendance area. This comparison was made possible by using geographic information systems (GIS) to link maps of elementary, middle, and high school attendance boundaries with 2000 census data, the Common Core of Data, and the Private School Survey for the 22 largest school districts. Results show that public schools would be less racially segregated if all children living in a school district attended their local, neighborhood schools. Similarly, findings reveal that private, magnet, and charter schools contribute to overall racial segregation within most school districts. Finally, while segregation levels in school catchment areas become lower from elementary to middle to high schools, the difference in segregation between catchment areas and the schools that serve them remains constant across all levels.

The premise is that competitive incentives will change the organizational behavior of schools (and districts, dioceses, etc.) in ways that will lead to more equitable access for students across varied and often segregated urban landscapes. Drawing from theories of institutional environments and nonprofit firms, this analysis investigates patterns of access across three highly competitive local education markets to determine how school choices are arranged as options expand. The findings indicate that competitive incentives can have similar impacts on different types of organizations, but both policy variations and contextual factors such as demographic distributions may also play critical roles in shaping the market structures in which schools operate. Notably, all three cases showed patterns of exclusionary strategies that schools embraced to enhance market position. (Contains 13 notes, 5 tables, and 6 figures.)",

We begin to address this issue with data from charter schools and a comparison group of traditional public schools. We also conduct propensity score matching at the student level to further understand achievement gains. In our analyses of these data, we find no charter school effects on students' achievement gains. Instructional conditions, such as teachers' focus on academic achievement, are related to mathematics gains. However, we find that our innovation measure is negatively associated with gains (when other conditions are controlled for), which suggests that innovation for innovation's sake should not be the sole focus of schools, whether charter or not.",

Still, students in New York distinguish themselves much more along ethnic and racial lines than do London students. The evidence presented suggests that, in addition to national-level differences, traditional British school structure, which provides continuity of peers through the form class as well as time for socializing, leads to less emphasis on ethnic and racial boundaries than in the anomic structure of traditional urban American public high schools. It follows that, to promote ethnic and racial integration among teens, schools should not only serve integrated student bodies but also should maintain structures that present opportunities for students to bridge racial and ethnic boundaries. The study employs ethnographic data from schools in New York and London and 120 in-depth interviews.",

        "author":["Rocque, Michael"],
        "description":"Previous research has consistently found a relationship between student race and discipline. For example, African Americans are more likely than whites to be sent to the office or suspended. However, much of this work is limited by a lack of student behavior and school-level variables. This study examined the effect of student race on office referrals in 45 elementary schools while controlling for ratings of student behavior and using a fixed effects model to remove school-level influences. The results indicate that African American students are significantly more likely to be referred to the office than other racial groups. Neither student behavior nor school-level factors are sufficient to explain this relationship; however, these factors do dampen the effect of race on discipline, suggesting that previous work has reported inflated coefficients. Given the historical association between exclusionary school discipline and later negative life outcomes, this issue warrants increased attention. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.",

This study examines the connection between administrator professional development and performance in a national sample of schools.

In particular, we find evidence that principals who invest in university course work as professional development are rated lower. In contrast, participation in formal mentoring programs is associated with higher ratings. Employing instrumental variables to account for selection on unobserved factors into different professional development types, we uncover further evidence of a negative impact of university course taking on principal performance.",

This article examines how students in a program with a social justice agenda understood the concept and how their understandings played out in practice. Using interviews and observations, we show that teacher candidates focused on ensuring pupils' learning rather than merely boosting their self-esteem or spreading political ideologies, as critics of the social justice agenda suggest. In classrooms, candidates concentrated on teaching content and skills but also had a critical perspective, built on pupils' cultural resources, and attempted to reach every pupil. We argue that teaching for social justice, or what we title \"good and just teaching,\" reflects an essential purpose of teaching in a democratic society in which the teacher is an advocate for students whose work supports larger efforts for social change.

Rather, immigrants have consistently sought to utilize American schooling for purposes of incorporation into a system of American ethnic groups that exhibit aspects of acculturation and retention. I make the case for continuity through an examination of the fate of homeland languages in the public schools during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; of the role of parochial schooling in the first third of the twentieth century; of the resistance of Mexican Americans of Crystal City, Texas, to \"schooled ethnicity\" during the 1970s and 1980s; of the attitudes of contemporary immigrants toward bilingual education; and, finally, of patterns of supplementary schooling among the children of immigrants.

        "description":"During the 1980s and 1990s, administrative decentralization was a prominent reform theme in public education. Revisiting those efforts today reveals a conceptual landscape often governed by ad hoc theorizing, untested assumptions, and an overall lack of consistency and coherence. It provides an example of how terminological ambiguity on the part of researchers and policy makers can stifle a policy's impact and obstruct attempts to learn from failure. In this article, I propose to surface and spell out some of the unarticulated contingencies that marred many decentralization efforts. Drawing on recent organizational theory, I first update the theory of decentralization, especially the relationship between decentralization and recentralization and the evidence for structures that mix both. Next, I discuss three illustrative examples of decentralization in education to identify the ambiguities associated with the casual use of the term. I end by considering how the concept of decentralization can be returned to more effective use by specifying the situational and functional contingencies of decentralization.

We find that administrators negotiated local hiring goals with characteristics emphasized by federal and state teacher-quality policies, such as knowledge of the subject and teaching skills. While district administrators and principals largely \"bridged\" to external certification requirements, some principals \"buffered\" their hiring decisions from the pressures of test-based accountability. Principals who bridged to test-based accountability gave greater weight to subject knowledge and teaching skills. We find that bridging and buffering differs by policy and cannot be easily applied to accountability policies. Specifically, separating the indirect effect of external accountability from other policies influencing principal hiring is difficult. Our analysis also highlights tensions among local, state, and federal policies regarding teacher quality and the potential of accountability to permeate noninstructional school decision making.",

The impact of this increased mobility on scholastic achievement is still undecided, in part because of the difficulty in untangling compositional and contextual effects on educational outcomes. This article uses data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey to examine the influence of student mobility associated with open enrollment on the scholastic achievement of public school students in Los Angeles. Using a series of OLS regressions, the analysis shows that increased student mobility associated with open enrollment has a positive influence on the scholastic achievement of public school students controlling for student motivation, race, socioeconomic status, and the effects of school and neighborhood characteristics. It is also apparent that the wealth of the student's residential neighborhood is also important. Taken together, these results highlight the complexity of the geography of opportunity associated with educational outcomes and the need for continued research on the sociospatial dimension of scholastic achievement.",

        "description":"Key legislative objectives of charter schools are to provide more school and classroom options, increase teacher influence over decision making, and increase school autonomy from state and district policy. Using national data from the 2003-4 School and Staffing Survey, we found that charter schools attained these legislative objectives when compared with regular schools, although increases in teacher influence and school autonomy were modest. Although charter schools have been implemented much as intended by legislation, other research has shown that charter schools in general have not improved student achievement--a major objective of charter school legislation.Our results suggest that this cannot be attributed to a failure to implement the charter school concept with respect to the legislative objectives examined.

Policy makers place tremendous faith in the power of data to transform practice, but the fate of policy makers' efforts will depend in great measure on the very practice they hope to move. In most conversations about data use, however, relations between data and practice have been underconceptualized. In this essay, I identify and discuss some conceptual and analytical tools for studying data in practice by drawing on work from various theoretical traditions. I explore some ways in which we might frame a research agenda in order to investigate data in everyday practice in schools. My account is centered on schoolhouse work practice, but the research apparatus I consider can be applied to practice in other organizations in the education sector and indeed to interorganizational practice, a critical consideration in the education sector.

Starting with a review of the extant research on teachers' data use practice in workplace and professional development contexts, this article argues for a more conceptually robust, methodologically sophisticated, and extensive program of micro-process research on data use that also anticipates the ways in which local practice both instantiates and constructs institutional and organizational structures, processes, and logics.

        "description":"Our current educational environment is subject to persistent calls for accountability, evidence-based practice, and data use for improvement, which largely take the form of performance metrics (PMs). This rapid proliferation of PMs has profoundly influenced the ways in which scholars and practitioners think about their own practices and the larger missions in which they are embedded. This article draws on research in organizational sociology and higher education to propose a framework and research agenda for analyzing the relationship between PMs and practice. I argue that PMs need to be understood as a distinctive form of data whose consequences in use relate to their role as formalized systems of abstractions and the social mechanisms through which they exert change in practice.

        "description":"Research on evidence use in school districts overwhelmingly focuses within schools on how school staff work with evidence including student performance data, research, and information about teaching quality. While important, this focus on schools reflects a mismatch with federal and state policies that demand not only that school staff work with evidence but that school district central office administrators do as well. This school focus also downplays how complex, social school-level change processes such as evidence use may typically involve central office staff in implementation and vice versa. To what extent do central offices matter to school-level evidence-use processes, and do schools matter to such processes in central offices? We explore these questions with a review of research on evidence use in schools and central offices with a focus on school-central office relationships in the process. We find that central offices and schools influence each other's evidence-use processes in specific respects. We elaborate what extant research teaches about these relationships and argue that future research should aim to understand how evidence use plays out not solely within schools or central offices but across district systems and through interactions between central office and school staff.",

How do policies, social structures, artifacts, and attendant classifications that span multiple organizational contexts get taken up in local practice, and how, in turn, are they generated in and from local practice? How do these interactive processes shape the way people understand themselves and the world around them, and how do these understandings shape their individual and collective capacities for action? In this commentary, the author analyzes the rich examples of data use research and practice provided by the contributors to this issue to argue for the importance of exploring the macro-micro dialectic in education research and practice more broadly.

The authors together craft important messages about what type of research must be done to address these concerns. But perhaps even more important, the authors offer a clarion call to education policy makers and school practitioners that school improvement leading to better outcomes for all children will require more than delivering data to the schoolhouse door. It is essential for all educational practitioners at every level of the system to build multiple fluencies regarding data and evidence use to truly have the capacity to use data to improve practice. While researchers continue to explore and understand data use in multiple educational contexts during this era of data-driven decision making, practitioners and policy makers will need to interact with the data and evidence before them with a healthy sense of constructive skepticism.",

However, more than 140 universities in 59 countries established academic chairs, research centers, and programs for human rights from 1968-2000, a development that highlights the diffuse penetration of the social movement into core domains of society. We investigate this process with event history models, finding that countries embedded in the human rights regime and countries with dense civil society linkages to the human rights movement are particularly likely to develop a university human rights program. We also find that the structuration of the global human rights regime has an independent positive influence on the rate of country adoption, but national human rights violations, social unrest, and indicators of modernization or development are less salient.

Overall, lower-performing students benefit as much as other students from teachers except in fourth grade, where lower-performing students benefit more.

This research uses content analyses of state standards and assessments and survey data on more than 27,000 teachers' instruction in mathematics, science, and English/language arts (ELA) to investigate changes in instructional alignment between 2003 and 2009. Fixed-effects models indicate that alignment in grades K-12 mathematics increased by approximately 0.19-0.65 standard deviations, depending on the grade and target. Alignment also increased to grades K-12 standards in ELA and grades 3-8 standards in science, though the magnitudes were smaller.

        "description":"Education is ubiquitous and inevitable; schooling is an institutionalized activity usually confined to designated times and places. Public schooling is subject to public regulation and control, presumably for the common good. The author contends that true democratic education seeks educational equality as a way to educate individuals capable of criticizing and recreating society--not simply reproducing the status quo. Surprisingly, many of the author's student teachers find the notion of creative democracy puzzling. They assume their democracy is complete and only requires preserving. This essay arises out of the author's efforts to reply to their perplexity. The author stresses that educators must assail the very idea of one-size-fits-all standards as a vehicle for educational equality in a democratic society, especially in such a society's public school system. He argues that equality is the antithesis of sameness, at least in the sense of democratic equality, or what Dewey sometimes calls \"moral equality.\" Democratic moral equality celebrates incommensurably unique, one-time-only qualitative individuality. When people interpret equality in terms of quantitative sameness and one-size-fits-all standards, it destroys democratic moral equality while corrupting the ideal of equality of educational opportunity.

        "description":"This article presents the author's critiques on Jim Garrison's essay and focuses on Garrison's concerns about the affronts posed to democracy by the standardization and accountability regimes in education. He rightfully highlights a few critical ways by which standardization and accountability in education reflect and reinforce antidemocratic tendencies associated with the colonization of the life-world by systems-world thinking (Garrison 2012). For Garrison, processes associated with standardization in education seem to pose a potent threat to individuality, while redefining and exacerbating inequality. In the least, these processes, in education and their iterations in the wider society more generally, have clearly redefined dominant assumptions about the causes of, and thusly delimited \"viable\" responses to, contemporary inequalities--hence the endless siren song of more \"accountability\" and \"privatization\" of both public goods and social issues (and less autonomy and responsibility), even under the \"Change and Hope\" presidential administration. To provide theoretical grounds for opposing standardization in education and revitalizing the democratic mission of public schools, Garrison draws insight from John Dewey's work on individuality and critiques of early to mid-twentieth-century administrative and testing practices, and this source of insight is both the potential strength and limitation of his argument. In closing, the author shares Garrison's concern for the threats posed by standardization and accountability to public schools and a creative democracy.",

        "description":"Jim Garrison's article (Garrison 2012) critiques current reforms in the United States for fostering a harmful &quot;standardization&quot; in schooling, which threatens to further undermine the country's democratic heritage and to prepare many students for servitude in an oppressive social order. John Dewey is cited throughout, as befits Professor Garrison's scholarly background, although the argument consequently often proceeds from authority rather than evidence. It offered as a critical treatise and a broad historical thesis about the genesis and nature of the current reform regime. With respect to the latter, a number of assertions are made about &quot;the new structural feudalism,&quot; with &quot;money managers&quot; occupying positions of control in a globalizing economy. The article's principal object is standardization, although this is never carefully defined. All schooling, after all, entails some degree of standardizing, as putting students into classrooms generally means a common curriculum and approach to learning. Garrison suggests that standardized tests reflect the biases of the ruling classes, yet makes little effort to establish the point. Garrison also raises the question of egalitarianism, suggesting that true equality is inconsistent with standards represented by NCLB. But for most public school students, especially those in middle-class suburban communities, state standards pose little threat to the pursuit of individual interests and creativity. It is important to bear in mind that NCLB does not demand excellence in key subjects, but rather a basic level of proficiency.",

The current study examined the relationship between an authoritative school climate (characterized by high levels of student support and disciplinary structure) and both teacher reports of victimization and school records of threats against staff. Regression analyses in a statewide sample of 280 high schools showed that structure (as measured by student- and teacher-reported clarity of school rules) and support (as measured by teacher-reported help seeking) were associated with less teacher victimization, after controlling for school and neighborhood demographics. Support, but not structure, was a consistent predictor of school records of threats against faculty. These findings offer implications for improving the workplace for teachers and staff.

The results show that there is little evidence that new public schools struggle with initial start-up issues to the same extent as new charter schools. Even after controlling for school characteristics, new public schools generally perform about as well as one would predict given their demographic and socioeconomic profile. New public schools hit the ground running and maintain steady performance, while new charter schools begin to improve after their first year and slowly close the gap. Other studies have found that new charter schools are susceptible to what we label a &quot;new school effect,&quot; where performance starts off low and then declines or remains stagnant during the first few years of operation. We find little evidence of this pattern for either new charter or new public schools. (Contains 12 tables and 5 notes.)",

Key events occurred between 1992, when &quot;Flores v. State of Arizona&quot; challenged the funding of instruction for ELLs, and 2006, when the legislature adopted a law creating an English Language Learners Task Force that was to develop a 4-hour-per-day structured English immersion (SEI) program for ELLs. Analysis indicates that the new policy is consistent with the state's traditionalistic political culture and emerging neoliberal political regime and with the mythical role of an immigrant's learning of English as a mark of becoming an American. Policy leaders used and altered the state's political institutions to advance their objectives. The study concludes with a four-prong test for assessing the fit of proposed policies with the current political context of the state. (Contains 3 tables and 3 notes.)",

While parents are seen as critical change agents, little research documents how engaging in school choice affects parents' lived experiences as citizens engaged in the democratic process. This 1-year case study based on parent interviews and participant observation at a foreign language immersion magnet school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, suggests that choice works in complex, contradictory ways to both empower and disempower parents as participatory citizens in democratic change and that market-driven school choice situates parents as consumers and thus redefines education as a private rather than a public good. The implications for fulfilling the promises of parent empowerment through school choice are examined. (Contains 3 tables and 16 notes.)",

We have identified seven keys to successful community health worker supervision: (1) Advocate for CHWs; (2) Recruit thoughtfully; (3) Develop field sensitivity; (4) Trust and respect the CHW; (5) Clarify boundaries and scope of practice; (6) Develop structure, but be flexible; and (7) Encourage continued learning. Effective supervision can improve and support the abilities of the CHW as he or she helps clients cope with life's challenges. When the CHW's cultural and interpersonal strengths are combined with effective supervision and support, they become a vital member of the health care team.",

        "description":"This study examines urban/suburban differences in educational outcomes in light of Tilly's conception of &quot;opportunity hoarding.&quot; Data from the U.S. Census reveal the changing circumstances of 17-year-olds in central city and suburban settings across the post-World War II period. Focusing on the metropolitan Northeast and Eastern Midwest, we consider a range of factors associated with differences in educational attainment. Using a multilevel analytic strategy, we find evidence that clear distinctions emerged in this period, marking the educational status of youth in central city and suburban settings. While there were signs of urban/suburban inequality in certain metropolitan contexts and for specific types of suburbs in 1940, 40 years later the urban-suburban divide was clearly evident across all metropolitan settings. A wide range of factors became associated with this form of spatial differentiation in school experiences during the postwar era, suggesting that a prolonged process of systematic exclusion characterized this dimension of metropolitan development. We close with a brief discussion of policy implications for addressing school-related factors that may contribute to these differences. (Contains 6 tables and 11 notes.)",

        "description":"Increasingly, college graduation is seen as a necessary step toward achieving the American Dream. However, large disparities exist in graduation rates. For many families, the current family income is not enough to finance college. Therefore, many young adults have to rely on education loans, which may be difficult to repay, leaving them strapped with debt after leaving college. This study examines the potential role of assets and savings for promoting college progress among young adults. Overall, findings suggest that policies, such as Child Development Accounts (CDAs), that help parents and youth accumulate savings--especially savings for college--may increase college attendance and graduation completion rates.

        "description":"Schools are beset with a serious \"alienation gap\" between teachers and students that is no less a problem than the \"achievement gap.\" Increasing student voice is thought to be one means to fill the gap, for it activates agency and thereby decreases passivity. The extent of agency ranges from attentive adult listening to strong student leadership. Here we concentrate on distinguishing elements of freedom, power, and authority in the enactment of agency, particularly how these elements can be distributed to students in urban authoritarian schools. In this article, four second-year Teach for America graduate students describe and reflect on their separate initiatives. Following the descriptions, the senior author, in a cross-case analysis, suggests factors associated with successful outcomes--enhanced self-esteem, individual rather than collective pride, careful consideration of the external context, constrained objectives, and the transfer of authority rather than power. We conclude that in troubled, impoverished schools, incremental change in distributing genuine authority is a promising possibility for enhancing school attachment. (Contains 1 note.)",

        "description":"This study explores how structural, compositional, and cultural characteristics of the teacher workplace affect an individual teacher's trust in colleagues. In particular, we investigate whether a homogeneous staff culture facilitates trust among teachers. Multilevel analyses on data of 2,104 teachers across a representative sample of 84 secondary schools in Flanders (Belgium) reveal that collegial trust is fostered when teachers agree on the teachability of the students in school. A mesomediation model demonstrates that the presence of a less homogeneous teachability culture explains the lower levels of collegial trust in socioeconomically disadvantaged schools. Our findings suggest that school leaders should focus on developing similar and positive conceptions among their teachers about students' teachability, in order to build social capital within the teaching staff to benefit student learning.

A better understanding is important, because fear of victimization can generate negative academic consequences for the individual student and larger school environment. To explore students' fear, our study takes a cross-national approach and compares the United States and Israel. Previous victimization experience is universally associated with fear at school. With regard to other correlates, greater similarities are found between U.S. and Israeli-Jewish students than for either group with Israeli-Arab students. Our study also examines students' fear while traveling to school. Here, similarities are found among all students. Girls and students victimized at school report being fearful more often while traveling to school than boys and students who were not victimized.

While scholars have linked these experiences to their attrition, this qualitative study explores black professors' larger range of responses to difficult professional environments. Twenty-eight black professors employed at two large public research universities participated in this study. Findings indicate that in addition to institutional departure, black faculty respond to personal and institutional racism though a form of psychological departure and acts of critical agency, specifically forming external networks, aiming to disprove stereotypes and engaging in service activities. Thus, institutions must be mindful of the full range of responses to the racism that black professors face, not assuming the climate is hospitable simply because faculty are not leaving the institution. Rather, campuses must improve their campus environments through ongoing strategic initiatives focused on cultural change. (Contains 2 tables.)",

A modified phenomenological research method suited for an educational research context was used to capture administrators' perspectives and experiences. Results challenge the theoretical notion that the expression, \"serve the best interests of the student\" is, or should be, used in some primary, rule-based first order manner by administrators to inform their ethical decision making. Ethical judgment was more complicated and contextually defined than following a fundamental professional injunction, but the expression resonated with administrators, typifying dispositions that promote moral practice.

Our event history analysis finds that the percentage of female legislators (an indicator of descriptive representation), the percentage of the population that is foreign born, the level of unemployment, and the type of higher education governance in a state are associated with the likelihood of an ISRT initiative achieving the legislative agenda.

This article provides a critical synthesis of educational literature on school social networks among educators to advance our understanding of the embeddedness of teachers in the social context of schools. It focuses on how researchers currently use a social network perspective as a theoretical lens and methodology to frame studies on teacher collaboration in schools. Building on exemplary findings of recent studies, it shows that the pattern of social relationships among teachers may significantly enhance our understanding of the ways in which teacher collaboration takes place and contributes to student learning, teachers' instructional practice, and the implementation of reform.

We also investigated the degree to which length of time under sanction affects the processes, relationships, and social climates of schools as well as the extent to which the relationships and climate of the larger district facilitate or hinder improvement in schools under sanction. Results indicate sparse ties within these schools, suggesting limited connectedness of staff with greater connectivity in the school that was newly placed on sanction. We also found school climates that did not support the type of collaboration necessary to bring about organizational learning and improvement. Finally, we found that a negative social climate and weak underlying relationships between district leaders inhibited the flow of ideas and practices district-wide, especially to these low-performing schools. These findings have important implications for school and district improvement under high-stakes accountability policies. (Contains 5 tables, 4 figures and 2 notes.)",

        "description":"This article examines how formal school leaders are positioned in their school's instructional networks based on an analysis of data from all 30 elementary schools in one mid-sized urban school district. Premised on the assumption that advice and information are key building blocks for knowledge development, we analyzed the instructional advice and information networks for mathematics and language arts, the two core elementary school subjects. Our exploratory account examines the prominence of formal leaders in their school's instructional networks as well as their membership and distribution across subgroups within these networks. Our analysis suggests that, although the school principal is not a central actor in the instructional advice and information network in a majority of these schools, formally designated school leaders as a group do occupy central positions. Examining formal school leaders' network and subgroup membership as well as their distribution across subgroups in schools, our account suggests that full-time and especially part-time formal school leaders play important roles in how elementary schools organize for instruction, brokering relations among staff and as representatives of the formal organization in subgroups. We also explore relations between formal school leaders' positioning in these networks and their schools' alignment with standards and normative structures. (Contains 6 tables and 5 notes.)",

The analysis relies on social network data and self-reports of writing instructional practices from teachers in 20 different schools that were part of a longitudinal study of the National Writing Project's partnership activities. The results indicate that both organized professional development and interactions with colleagues who gained instructional expertise from participating in prior professional development were associated with the extent to which teachers changed their writing processes instruction. Furthermore, the effects of professional development varied by teachers' baseline practices. The study illustrates the potential for using data on teachers' social networks to investigate indirect effects of professional development and the variation in professional development effects associated with different initial levels of expertise.

While existing research suggests that teachers' social networks play a crucial role, we know little about what dimensions of teachers' social networks matter for sustainability. Drawing from a longitudinal study of the scale-up of mathematics reform, we use qualitative social network analysis and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to investigate the relationship between teachers' social networks and sustainability. Teachers' social networks in the first 2 years of the initiative influenced their ability to sustain reform-related instructional approaches after supports for reform were withdrawn. Social networks with combinations of strong ties, high-depth interaction, and high expertise enabled teachers to adjust instruction to new conditions while maintaining the core pedagogical approach. This research contributes to our understanding of the dynamics of sustainability and to social network theory and research. (Contains 5 tables, 1 figure and 6 notes.)",

It is particularly crucial, I argue, that researchers struggle to interrogate education's familiar racial practices more self-consciously and strategically. I suggest that researchers \"race wrestle\" by struggling with race on two levels: researchers can (1) learn from the everyday struggles over race already taking place in U.S. schools and (2) struggle more actively with race talk and analysis in our own research. I argue that refocusing analytic attention on everyday struggles over race in educational practice and research is a necessary strategy for moving forward toward racial equality.",

This view hinders many well-intentioned teachers from implementing SEL in their classrooms.

Recent research has called for methods to access, represent, and communicate what successful school leaders know. Aristotle's concept of \"phronesis,\" or practical wisdom, captures the scope of such knowledge but also points out the difficulties of representing practical knowledge apart from the context of exercise. This article argues that the artifacts, such as policies, programs, and procedures, that school leaders develop and use can serve as occasions to document the expression of phronesis in context. Developing phronetic narratives of how successful leaders use artifacts to establish the conditions for improving student learning provides a significant resource to guide the learning of aspiring school leaders.",

        "description":"In August 2001, the state-run Control Board for the Chester-Upland School District awarded control of nine of their 10 schools to Edison Schools, with little opposition. In contrast, nearby Philadelphia fought state efforts to privatize schools. Finally, on July 31, 2002, the joint state-city Philadelphia School Reform Commission partially privatized 45 (17 percent) of the city's 264 public schools, while partly reconstituting 41 others. Published sources, fieldwork, and semi-structured interviews with 26 policy makers and educators are used to explain the different approaches to privatization. The small size and related low community involvement of Chester, Pennsylvania, enabled the state to conduct more thoroughgoing policy change with less opposition. Further, Philadelphia schools had made some progress in the 1990s, while dire conditions in Chester encouraged more extreme reform. Chester's less scrutinized, more thoroughgoing privatization had a more troubled first year than did the more measured reforms implemented in Philadelphia, suggesting that a more open political process may yield better programmatic results. The article concludes with empirical and normative lessons about school privatization in urban school districts. Of particular import is that, paradoxically, political factors may force privatization and related reforms to be rushed in ways that make their educational success problematic.",

Rather than monitoring, oppressing, or regulating the inner state of the individual, the American approach is to construct and act upon an idealized self that fits well into the current political and social order.",

Approximately 290 students responded to the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) and filled out questionnaires. Multivariate analyses showed that the Montessori students reported greater affect, potency (i.e., feeling energetic), intrinsic motivation, flow experience, and undivided interest (i.e., the combination of high intrinsic motivation and high salience or importance) while engaged in academic activities at school. The traditional middle school students reported higher salience while doing academic work; however, such responses were often accompanied by low intrinsic motivation. When engaged in informal, nonacademic activities, the students in both school contexts reported similar experiences.

The first section provides an overview of modern school finance formulas and explains how legislatures in de jure segregated states might use state aid policies to produce racial funding disparities. The second section, through macrolevel, quantitative analyses, identifies those states where state aid is allocated such that minority populations are disadvantaged and where that disadvantage is subsequently reflected in total state and local revenue. The third section presents in-depth case analyses of racial disparities in Kansas and Alabama that were identified through macrolevel analyses. The final section analyzes possible legal challenges that plaintiffs in those formerly de jure segregated states identified in our case analyses may bring to racially neutral state aid policies that place minority school districts at a financial disadvantage.",

Governments devise instruments to encourage implementation, but they help only if used well by those with the problem, whose capability is often weak. The realization of policy in practice thus depends on the fit between capabilities that support implementation and aims. The more aims outstrip capabilities, the less likely is effective implementation. When Title 1 of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act began, capabilities were modest: the program's instruments were limited, and neither practitioners nor workers in the environment knew much about school improvement. Yet Title 1 became a viable program in the 1970s because its aims were defined in ways that were achievable, given the capability that was possible. Title 1 later was made the chief lever for national standards-based reform policies, but capability was far from what would be required to eliminate the achievement gap, and the revised Title 1 did not contain means to vastly increase capability. Thus an effort to promote ambitious instruction led to reduced standards of success. (Contains 22 notes.)",

Following this discussion of movement dynamics, I explore the question of how students might actually be affected if intelligent design were to be minimally incorporated into school curricula in an era when science has enormous cultural authority. I conclude with four prescriptive proposals that progressives might consider for responding to future creationist challenges. (Contains 2 notes.)",

Their agendas overlap with that of charter schools. They have an uncomfortable and sometimes adversarial relationship with standards, accountability, and the No Child Left Behind Act. They have migrated from their beginnings in Barker and Gump's (1964) work on rural schools to become a significant factor in urban school reform. They face two major hurdles. The first is scaling up. Small reform movements can survive on exemptions from prevailing policy. Large reform movements need institutional change. The second is that as an enterprise becomes popular it runs the risks of co-option and confusion. I argue that small school advocates need to work hard to maintain clarity about what is central to the movement. And I suggest that what should be central is an emphasis on creating community, not school size per se.

The former style of discourse tends to promote polarization and winner-take-all battles while the latter sustains a process of unguided \"muddling through.\" These two dynamics--clashing ideas and parochial practice--operate largely independently, but when they do intersect, it is more often in ways that are dysfunctional rather than enlightening.

A thorough review of the extant research, however, shows little evidence regarding its impact on governance, management, school organization, or teaching and learning. Looking beyond the K-12 sector suggests that there is some reason to believe that appointed boards can be more effective than elected ones at pursuing shared ends and resisting short-term political pressure. This analysis explains the key political and organizational claims for and against mayoral control and considers the implications for governance reform. In the end, the author concludes that mayoral control is an uncertain bet and poses potential long-term problems but--if designed thoughtfully--holds promise for deeply troubled urban school systems.

          "Farley-Ripple, Elizabeth"],
        "description":"There is abundant evidence that ninth grade is a critical year for students, particularly those enrolled in large urban school districts. Despite the importance of the freshman year for subsequent academic success, the existence of teacher status systems within schools suggests that ninth graders, who are traditionally viewed by teachers as low-status clients, will more likely be taught by low-status teachers: specifically, teachers who are not certified to teach and those who are new to the school. Using a merged teacher-student data set from a large urban district, we find that ninth graders are disproportionately assigned to uncertified teachers and teachers who are new to the school building and that having higher percentages of these teachers decreases predicted attendance, controlling for other factors. The article concludes with a discussion of strategies for staffing the ninth grade with strong teachers. (Contains 8 tables and 3 notes.)",

        "description":"In the early twentieth century, a new alliance formed between university-based scholars who dedicated themselves to the scientific study of education and public school officials. This alliance centered on the proposition that applied research could advance the professionalization of schooling and become a prestigious academic specialty in its own right. The American Educational Research Association (AERA) emerged to further these dual goals. This essay analyzes changes in the ideological and organizational dynamics of the AERA between 1915 and World War II. By 1940, the AERA's founding faith in a unifying professional identity had been undercut in two ways: first, by a weakening of the Progressive Era paradigm of a socially relevant science of education, and second, by an intensification of divisions among the constituencies that the AERA aspired to serve. Relying heavily on archival data, we track the multiple sources from which this gradual distancing of research from the politics of education occurred. (Contains 19 notes.)",

        "description":"The centralization of school discipline in the second half of the twentieth century is widely understood to be the inevitable result of court decisions granting students certain civil rights in school. This study examines the process by which school discipline became centralized in the Los Angeles City School District in the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, and finds that the locus of control over student discipline shifted from the school site to the centralized district largely in response to local pressures. Indeed, during a period of large-scale student unrest, and in an environment of widespread racial and cultural tensions, many Los Angeles students, parents, community members, and educators actively promoted the centralization of school discipline--although often for directly conflicting purposes. Ultimately, this article argues that the centralization of school discipline was not inevitable and must be understood in the broader historical context in which it occurred. (Contains 45 notes.)",

These policies create learning challenges for classroom teachers and for school and district leaders. This article engages questions about organizational support for professional learning in the context of reform initiatives. A theoretical lens--called the Vygotsky Space--is used to analyze case study data from a reforming urban school district located in the Pacific Northwest. A job-embedded professional development structure called the Elementary Studio/Residency Model is explored in depth as are the learning processes of one participating teacher. The teacher's professional learning experiences are then connected with leadership actions and institutional supports for learning. The relationship between organizational change and district leaders' attention to practitioner learning and innovation is discussed. (Contains 2 figures, 1 table and 13 notes.)",

By analyzing the contrasting ways that teachers in two schools in each district were linked to each other and reform efforts at the district level, the article shows how the district reform effort in one district led to significant opportunities for teacher learning and alignment with reform goals while efforts in the other district coordinated action but failed to spur meaningful opportunities for teacher learning.

Some suggest that these demands mean that central offices, especially in midsized and large districts, should become learning organizations but provide few guides for how central offices might operate as learning organizations. This article presents a conceptual framework that draws on organizational and sociocultural learning theories to elaborate what might be involved if central offices operated as learning organizations. Specific work practices that this conceptual framework highlights include central office administrators' participation in new school assistance relationships and their ongoing use of evidence from assistance relationships and other sources to inform central office policies and practices. Sense making and managing paradoxes are fundamental to these processes. I highlight these activities with empirical illustrations from research and experience, discuss conditions that help/hinder these activities, and suggest directions for district research and practice.

The article's major contribution is its examination of whether African-centered schools prepare Black children to participate in a democratic society and whether the construction of an essentialist racial identity might compromise their mission and success. We conclude that African-centered schools provide many of the same strengths found in other forms of community-based education but that they must continue to wrestle with essentialist notions of Black identity on which its discourse is built.

This study provides nationally representative evidence that both teacher certification and some reform-oriented mathematics teaching practices correlate positively with achievement and are more prevalent in public schools than in demographically similar private schools. Additionally, smaller class size, more prevalent in private schools, is significantly correlated with achievement. (Contains 5 tables and 12 notes.)",

A conceptualization of mentoring practice that rests on a shared vision of good mentoring, however, needs to be developed so that novice teachers receive more than emotional support or professional socialization. Knowing how to be a good mentor is not necessarily inherent in being a good teacher. How should good mentoring be conceptualized, and what images help shape that conceptualization? This article draws on data from a cross-national study of preservice and beginning teachers and their mentors to examine these questions. It concludes that, much like teaching, mentoring that is aimed at helping novices learn to teach is a professional practice with a repertoire of skill sets that must be learned over time.

        "description":"Raphael Cohen-Almagor's article &quot;Hate in the Classroom: Free Expression, Holocaust Denial, and Liberal Education&quot; (2008) calls for sanctions on those K-12 public school teachers whose deployment of &quot;hate speech&quot;--and/or associations with others who deploy it--creates a &quot;poisoned environment&quot; in the classroom. While stating his belief in the role of free expression as &quot;a fundamental right and value in democracies,&quot; Cohen-Almagor nevertheless believes that hate speech &quot;causes immediate mental and emotional stress&quot; and perhaps even &quot;psychological harm&quot; to those it targets and so has no place in the public school system, which should be guided by liberal educational principles. He illustrates his argument by reference to the cases of three Canadian teachers, each of whom has had his teaching certificate revoked, is politically on the far right, and is directly or indirectly associated with Holocaust denial. In this rejoinder, the author focuses on Cohen-Almagor's contention that public school teachers should be fired if their out-of-classroom utterances or associations cross liberal and contractual requirements. The author argues that what Cohen-Almagor presents is an illiberal educational argument in the service of putatively liberal educational principles. (Contains 25 notes.)",

        "description":"Terry Heinrichs's rejoinder (in this issue, p169) criticizes this author and the Canadian boards of education for firing Malcolm Ross and Paul Fromm. In essence, Heinrichs agrees that the firing of James Keegstra was justified, as Keegstra brought his hatred into his classroom. Heinrichs thinks the case is very different when hate mongers preach hatred only outside of the classroom. Then their position as &quot;educators&quot; should remain intact. In essence, while this author thinks that one can either be a hate monger or a teacher, Heinrichs thinks there is no inner contradiction between the two. Teachers can spew their venom in all public places, but as long as they refrain from explicitly bringing it to the classroom, that is fine. This author remains convinced that it is not. In this response, he contends that Heinrichs failed to understand that his article deals with education and the role of the teacher. Heinrichs instead interprets his article as a restrictive thesis of free expression. The author argues that outspoken hate mongers, inside or outside of the classroom, cannot and should not be educators. Students should not be subjected to a teacher who is unable to appreciate difference and pluralism, who understands liberty as a tool for hate, who abhors tolerance, and who exemplifies the opposite of moral, humanistic education.

        "description":"Because teachers work in relatively closed classroom spaces, they are notoriously difficult for administrators or parents to observe. At the same time, middle-class parents have demonstrated an interest in \"opening\" the closed classroom door. Findings from this research suggest that surveilling parents provided advantages for their child during the school day. Using their social networks, middle-class and socially connected working-class parents from this study increased levels of informal teacher surveillance by closely monitoring teachers in classrooms. Teachers, in turn, felt watched by surveilling parents. Poor parents and isolated working-class parents with little access to information about their child's classroom relied on teachers for mentorship. In order to isolate class differences, which are easily conflated with race differences, this study investigates a school with all African American families. This study identifies interactional mechanisms dependent on parent social class that facilitate unequal levels of everyday teacher surveillance in classrooms, securing school advantages for middle-class children.

We use survey data from 33 public schools serving grades 6-8 in a large mid-Atlantic city to examine relationships among physical disorder (e.g., broken windows and poor building conditions), fear, collective efficacy, and social disorder. Path analyses reveal a direct association between physical disorder and social disorder even when prior levels of collective efficacy are controlled--a finding consistent with traditional broken-windows theories. Further, there is evidence that the effects of physical disorder may be operating through increased fear and decreased collective efficacy to affect perceptions of threatening or violent interactions among people.

We find state political characteristics, organizational structures, and policy conditions are associated with the spread of dual enrollment policies.

        "description":"This article looks at urban education through the vantage point of Chicago's mayors. It begins with Carter H. Harrison II (who served from 1897 to 1905 and again from 1911 to 1915) and ends with Richard M. Daley (1989 to the present), with most of the focus on four long-serving mayors: William Hale Thompson (1915-23 and 1927-31), Edward Kelly (1933-47), Richard J. Daley (1955-76), and Harold Washington (1983-87). Mayors exercised significant leverage in the Chicago Public Schools throughout the twentieth century, making the history of Chicago mayors' educational politics relevant to the contemporary trend in urban education to give more control to mayors in hopes that it leads to improved educational attainment and achievement. A look backward to mayoral politics in Chicago suggests that mayoral control is no panacea for urban education: mayors used strategies of patronage and professionalism to maintain political power, and this eclipsed motivations to improve the schools in an educational sense, in spite of recurrent calls for better schools from the civil rights movement, middle-class reformers, and business interests.

Using a near-census of U.S. public schools, this new analysis considers the likelihood that schools become high flyers. The results suggest that of the more than 60,000 schools considered, low-poverty schools are 22 times more likely to reach consistently high academic achievement compared with high-poverty schools. Schools serving student populations that are both low poverty and low minority are 89 times more likely to be consistently high performing compared with high-poverty, high-minority schools. This does not mean that schools have no influence over student achievement, or that schools should be unaccountable, but that accountability systems need to have carefully defined objectives and measures of school progress.

        "description":"Seemingly endless tinkering and adjustment of the structure of education in the United States over the past century have led to the adoption of different school forms (grouping particular grades into separate schools) at different times. These different school forms necessitate transitions between schools (e.g., from a middle school to a high school), which, prior research has argued, have detrimental effects on students' well-being. In this article, we use natural variation in the American educational system to reexamine the effects of school transitions. Contrary to most prior research on the subject, we directly compare the ninth-grade outcomes of students who make a transition in moving to ninth grade with those who do not. Our results show that for both academic and nonacademic outcomes, the presence of a transition from eighth grade to ninth grade makes almost no difference for students' ninth-grade outcomes relative to those of students who do not change schools between those grades. This is not to suggest that outcomes do not change between eighth grade and ninth grade but that the degree of difference is the same for students who change schools as for those who do not. Where differences appear, they are small and point to the benefits of school transitions for providing fresh starts to adolescents in socially difficult situations.",

It also tests the hypothesis, generated from qualitative research, that such &quot;language brokering&quot; is related to academic outcomes. Using data collected from a subset of children (n = 87), longitudinal regression models, which controlled for early school performance, showed that higher levels of language brokering were significantly linked to better scores on fifth- and sixth-grade standardized reading tests. We suggest studying how to cultivate similar experiences at school to improve bilingual students' achievements. We also call for further mixed-method studies on this topic.",

        "description":"Scholars and practitioners have long criticized teacher evaluation as ineffective. Peer assistance and review (PAR) alters traditional teacher evaluation, as master teachers conduct summative as well as formative assessment of beginning teachers and veteran teachers in need of intervention. Relying on data from a longitudinal case study of one urban district, this article describes key components of teacher evaluation with PAR, in particular how it differs from teacher evaluation as typically conducted by principals. Findings are reported across six key factors: time, professional development, transparency, labor relations, decision making, and accountability. Notably, a substantially higher level of accountability appeared present with PAR than prior to program implementation. In contrast to popular opinion, this study provides an example of teachers willing and able to engage in the summative evaluation of their peers, a key component of professionalism and professionalization. Implementation challenges and areas for future research are addressed.",

Yet, these types of initiatives typically target aspects of the profession external to the work of teaching. In this article, I expand the view of professionalism implicit in these reform efforts by showing how practice can also be seen as an explanatory variable that acts on professionalism. I propose a theoretical frame for understanding the complex relationships between instructional practice and professionalism, illustrating the way in which practice both shapes and is shaped by public perception of the profession and how this bears on education's professional strength. The framework highlights key levers for improvement, less emphasized in past research, and in particular, draws attention to the way in which most professions control practice and the viability of these mechanisms in education.

The two winners have been canonized in the scholarship on early American educational thought. This essay refocuses attention on the great contest itself, not only seeking understanding of the works that it produced but also analyzing its intrinsic significance in American educational thought. While the great contest was a failure in its day, the essays it produced provide evidence of a decided lack of consensus about American education right from the start of the nation. The contest highlights key tensions in American  educational research and policy: Should girls be educated the same as boys? Can religion be taught in public schools? Is higher education a right or a privilege? Should policy be made locally or centrally? Is there such a thing as an \"American\" education? The founding generation could not provide answers, but they did identify the enduring questions. (Contains 29 notes.)",

In this article, we analyze the different ranking systems, including a new approach we have developed in order to illustrate the arbitrariness of any given ranking system and to highlight some key charter school issues.

We set out to determine whether a district effect was present in the implementation of HSA systems in six southern states and whether that effect was accompanied by the types of activities previously identified in the research literature as being associated with changes in teaching and learning and student achievement. We tested a theory of action that assumed that HSA would cause school districts to develop coherent instructional strategies that would be evidenced by the provision of coherent, high-quality professional development and the alignment of district policy and resources in support of school improvement. These activities on the part of districts would then improve student achievement as measured by state tests. (Contains 9 tables and 2 notes.)",

Using German Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP) data, analyses highlight the group-specific effects of parental social capital on track placement among 11-16-year-old German and non-German students. For both groups, parents' family ties fail to affect track placement. Parents' community ties have mixed effects. Among Germans, parental involvement in sports affects children's tracking positively. Among non-Germans, parental socializing with peers affects track placement negatively, while parental involvement in religion-based community groups and interethnic ties with Germans improve track placement chances.

These partnerships' theories of change provide action-oriented knowledge for scale-up in other school communities. Among this research's other contributions are partnership commonalities, indicators of uniqueness, and partnership classifications.

Despite differences regarding the means for improving teacher quality, both agendas try to depict their ideas as empirically sound, results driven, and in the best interest of the American public. Organized around and extending a framework devised by Cochran-Smith and Fries (2001), the article analyzes legislation as well as public reports and speeches on teacher education to unpack how the professionalization-deregulation debate is playing out in federal policy.

        "description":"This study compares middle schools to K-8 schools, as well as to newly formed K-8 schools that are part of a K-8 conversion policy. The outcome is student achievement, and our sample includes 40,883 eighth-grade students from 95 schools across five cohorts. The analysis uses multilevel modeling to account for student, cohort, and school-level variation, and it includes statistical controls for both population demographics and school characteristics. The results find that older K-8 schools perform significantly better than middle schools, and this advantage is explained by differing student and teacher populations, average grade size, and school transition. Newer K-8 schools did not enjoy the same advantage despite having smaller grades and lower transition rates, due to their more disadvantaged populations. (Contains 4 tables and 3 figures.)",

Children and adolescents appeared to be drawn together by common interests and play styles, personal attraction, and complementary desires to nurture and be nurtured. Further analyses identified apparent contributions of such interactions to both parties' physical, intellectual, and social/moral education. Adolescents led children to act within the latter's zones of proximal development (Vygotsky's term), and children stimulated adolescents to make implicit knowledge explicit, be creative, and practice nurturance and leadership.",

        "description":"Around the world people confront monuments that celebrate historical origins, movements, heroes, and triumphs no longer seen as worthy of celebration. While an analysis of these &quot;lieux de memoire&quot; themselves can reveal historical consciousness, the sites become particularly interesting at the moment when they inspire debate, namely, when people ask what can be done with these artifacts of earlier power configurations, outdated modes of understanding, and bygone identities. Recent protests over a series of murals depicting the origins of civilization in British Columbia, located in the central rotunda of the British Columbia Legislative Buildings, offer this opportunity. This article analyzes a sample of 53 essays written by senior high school students, responding to the dilemma of what to do about the murals. It explores four different orientations toward the past implicit in the student responses, using theoretical frames adapted from Nietzsche and Rusen. These have implications for identities, public policies, and the teaching and learning of history in the present.",

This essay uses a simple marker that has been closely examined in the historical literature, the ability to sign one's name, to study circumstances of literacy learning in a sample of 782 children that dates from about two centuries ago. Few children had learned to write upon entrance to the orphanage that produced these records, the Charleston, South Carolina, Orphan House, but the great majority could sign upon exit. Boys were more likely to sign at entrance and exit, but the increase in literacy that was due to the Orphan House school's efforts was greater among girls. Boys seem to have learned to write within 1-3 years of admission, but it took girls much longer, on average, to acquire literacy. While changes in pedagogical techniques had little effect, literate mothers may have been able to help their sons learn to write even after admission.",

        "description":"This article discusses the meaning of the idea that schools should be communities. It argues that the view that schools should be communities should be viewed as a distinct vision of school reform because it has a distinct vision of the problems that require solution (alienation and disengagement) and how they are to be solved. It contrasts this vision with standards-based reform and with the emphasis on small schools. The article argues that schools that are communities should be rooted in a shared educational project -- a conception of the vision of the education the school wishes to provide that is shared by all members of the community. There are four C's of community: coherence, cohesion, care, and contact. Coherence consists of a shared vision and a shared language -- a shared educational project. Cohesion is the sense of community that results from the shared pursuit of such a project. Care is required for initiating students into this project. Contact concerns the structural features of schools, such as size, that facilitate personalization and care. Coherence is the central feature of community. In contrast, standards-based reform privatizes educational projects and instrumentalizes education. The emphasis on small schools tends to see contact as the crucial feature of community rather than coherence.",

The number of private tutoring businesses is rapidly growing in Canada, even though its educational system lacks characteristics that spark a demand for those services in other countries. Testing ideas derived from the school choice literature, I examine which kinds of parents hire and desire private tutors and how this demand is linked to other educational preferences. Using data from a national survey, I find that parents who hire or desire tutoring do not generally differ from other parents in their demographics or political ideology. However, though parents who employ tutors are generally satisfied with public education, they are less satisfied than other parents and tend to be more involved in their children's schooling. The largest effect is that parents who employ tutors are greatly more desiring of private schooling than other parents. I conclude that for many parents, private tutoring represents a &quot;school choice by default,&quot; an affordable alternative to private schools.",

Structural equation models were employed to analyze data from the Longitudinal Study of American Youth. Results showed that achievement demonstrated causal predominance over attitude across the entire secondary school. Gender differences in this causal relationship were not found, but elite status in mathematics (measuring whether students took calculus) moderated this causal relationship. We found an imbalanced reciprocal relationship between attitude and achievement across almost entire secondary school for nonelite students, with achievement showing causal predominance over attitude. Such a reciprocal relationship was absent among elite students. When there was a causal relationship between attitude and achievement among those students, achievement always claimed (unidirectional) causal predominance over attitude.",

While the underlying theory holds that competitive pressures will induce change and improvement in educational processes, research indicates that organizations often respond instead by developing promotional strategies to succeed in the marketplace. This analysis reviews evidence of organizational behavior in education in reconsidering theories of school responses to competition. Due to unique quasi-public good aspects of schooling, it appears that marketlike incentives are corrupted when applied to education, \"short-circuiting\" the incentives that reformers had intended to drive school improvement.

        "description":"The growing popularity of school choice is typically linked to the spread of neoliberal ideology. Identifying four components of this ideology, we examine the rationales of providers in an emerging private school market. Data come from interviews and site visits at 45 &quot;third-sector&quot; private schools in Toronto, Canada. We find that only one of the four components has a strong resonance among these educators. Few private school operators sharply criticize public schools, compete via quantitative performance indicators, or are strongly business oriented. However, they voice a philosophy of matching their personal talents to the needs of &quot;unique&quot; children. Overall, rather than being influenced by neoliberalism, these providers are more directly driven by personalized rationales that prize tailored education in specialized niches. We draw two conclusions from these findings. First, they demonstrate how ideologies of choice are shaped by their market setting, in this case, small proprietorship, in contrast to a corporate environment. Second, they highlight how providers can be motivated by new cultures of consumerism and intensive child rearing when working in highly uncertain conditions. We recommend that theories of choice recognize the range of educational markets and the specific motives of their providers. (Contains 10 notes.)",

        "description":"The economic model of education policy assumes that there is a substantial consensus on educational goals among constituencies and that the major challenge is to determine the most effective strategies for reaching those goals. Unfortunately, the debate over educational vouchers is complicated by the presence of multiple and competing goals, and mixed and ambiguous evidence. The result is that differences in conclusions on the effectiveness of vouchers largely mirror interpretations that are conditioned heavily by competing ideologies rather than straightforward facts. The primary conflict is between what we term \"libertarian\" and \"social contract\" positions. Libertarians believe that freedom of choice should be the highest priority of voucher reforms and assume that a private marketplace with increased options will promote greater efficiency and (possibly) equity. Advocates for a social contract maintain that education generates important positive externalities that are best promoted through a free, publicly funded and operated and democratically determined educational system. This work contends that evaluations must openly acknowledge such competing beliefs and preferences for particular goals rather than simply attributing their views to the \"facts.\" Our framework allows policy makers to predict outcomes and understand the trade-offs among goals that choice reforms entail, even in the presence of limited or ambiguous evidence.

        "description":"The past two decades have generated numerous and varied experiments with the use of public resources to support \"private\" schools, which, in any case, become and behave more like public schools in proportion to their dependence on the public purse. From an equity point of view, however, no compelling moral necessity exists to use public funds to support private schools. In fact, the best available evidence suggests that, in general and on average, private schools are no more efficient or effective in fostering valued and measurable student outcomes than public schools. The most common methods proposed to channel public funds to private schools are unethical because they exclude society's most vulnerable members, children from poor families, from any possibility of benefit--and furthermore, in nearly all jurisdictions they are, or would be, paid for from a revenue base that includes consumption taxes that all, even the poorest, must pay. Nonetheless, serious problems exist with equity of access to and benefit from public sector education. The most promising policy solution to the current perversely disequalizing tendencies of public education lies in public sector choice, however, not in public funding of private or quasi-private schools.

Among these devices, his chief bugbear is a largely unregulated form of school vouchers that democratic reformers have consistently damned since choice first surfaced as a hope for have-nots in the War on Poverty; specifically, he imagines participating private schools being left free to price the poor out with add-on tuition--or simply to exclude them in the first place. Advocates of the poor agree that the point of school choice reform is not to exclude but, at last, to include such families as responsible decision makers; Paquette's inventions are, as he would have it, \"morally opprobrious.\" In this article, the author provides his views on school choice for the poor.",

        "description":"This article features the author's reply to John Coons's \"Dodging Democracy: The Educator's Flight from the Specter of Choice.\" First, he wants to thank Coons for his thoughtful and thought-provoking reply to \"Public Funding for 'Private' Education: The Equity Challenge of Enhanced Choice.\" So thought provoking, in fact, did the author find Coons's reply that he reread it several times. For all the reasons he detailed in his original argument, he does not see public funding of private schools as a necessary, or even a promising, way to augment the educational and life chances of society's most disadvantaged children. He does, however, believe that choice within the public sector can be an efficacious way of augmenting both for poor children from educationally disadvantaged families--but only if and when state, provincial, and national legislators have the courage to insist on the following: (1) open school zoning with transportation; (2) interdiction of the use of admission criteria that serve as a proxy for socioeconomic status (SES); (3) extensive and detailed information programs to parents on choices available to them and the consequences of those choices for their children; (4) stringent limitations on the generation and use of private resources by public schools; and (5) a common core curriculum that ensures that each child, regardless of the educational choices of his or her parents, can participate in the broader intellectual and civic life of her or his society--and not just in some narrow enclave within it. According to him, he is more centrist than Coons, although, like Coons, he is profoundly disappointed with the track record of public education as a social equalizer, and like Coons he believes that drastic change is urgently needed. Still, like Coons, he is pragmatic enough to realize that no one is going to transform the public education colossus overnight. Unlike Coons, however, he believes that public education still represents the best chance at improving the educational and life chances of poor children from educationally disadvantaged families. And according to him, even Coons, after all, argues that public education should remain education's First Estate. (Contains 2 notes.)",

Some have suggested that these findings demonstrate a failing of education to reduce gaps in adult income and differences in adult socioeconomic status. This article reviews the research internationally and concludes that the debate is outdated. School children in the United States make up only 2 percent of the world's school children. When considering this question globally, it is discovered that social status is a consistent determinant of school performance, but it is not necessarily true that children of the poor perform systematically worse in school than do children of the rich; results vary by subject, student age, gender, and other factors. Perhaps more important, academics seem to hold schools accountable for the wrong function. The more important purpose of public schooling is to help foster social cohesion. Schools and school systems should be held accountable for their true purpose, and the debate should shift from whether schools narrow the gap in adult incomes to whether schools are effective in fostering social cohesion.",

Despite these high hopes, Goals 2000 and Title I faced a number of problems after they were passed, particularly in regard to the implementation of their accountability provisions. Similar problems appear to be surfacing in the course of the implementation of No Child Left Behind, the most recent reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

These macro-level topics are given life through institutional analysis set in liberal arts colleges, universities, community colleges, and special population or special mission institutions. What is \"known\" about higher education varies in each of these settings. Despite more than a century of published scholarship in the field of higher education, the body of literature regarding historically black colleges and universities is more problematic. Until recently, little has been \"known\" about these institutions. To be more explicit, there is an extant literature on the cohort of institutions defined as historically black colleges and universities (or HBCUs). There are multiple citations to the unique characteristics, special features, remarkable performance, or historic legacies of historically black colleges. Many of the aforementioned publications are contextual assessments or historical accounts. However, the existence of a collection of articles or publications that present ideas that emerge from empirical research has been limited.

The book he has produced is a cross between journalism and pamphlet, a piece of muckraking journalism, as he himself calls it. Brimelow reports and to some extent repeats the indictments of the teacher unions that have been heard before: poorly qualified teachers cannot be dismissed due to union protection, principals cannot effectively counteract declining test scores, and so on. But beyond documenting myriads of cases of abuse, Brimelow unpacks the legal institutes that enable the teacher trust. The latter maintains its hold over the public school system through unprecedented concessions from lawmakers in whose backyard the teachers as government employees operate. Essentially, it is government employees arguing with government employees. What is more, given their resources and time, the teachers have a great deal of say about who gets elected to government office. They have the time, money, and clout to block any reform pay for performance, tuition tax credits, charter schools, homeschooling--that would undermine the union's bargaining monopoly. Brimelow says he wrote the book because many activities of the teacher unions are, in his view, little known and understood by the general public.",

This article explores the policies that helped to reduce the achievement gap before 1990, the effects of the subsequent shift toward accountability, and what can be learned from past successes to guide the future development of accountability systems. An extensive review of research suggests that pre-1990s reductions in the achievement gap occurred because minority students were exposed to greater resources and academic content. We find little evidence that most forms of accountability have placed any downward pressure on the achievement gap, suggesting that the upward trend in the gap during the 1990s may be more than a coincidence. The few forms of accountability that have apparently helped to improve equity, especially promotion-graduation exams for students, have in common with past successful policies the effect of increasing student exposure to resources and/or content. This suggests that accountability can help to improve educational equity but that such a change must be based on some basic assumptions that are inconsistent with much of the current reform movement. Specifically, &quot;A Nation at Risk&quot; has important lessons for No Child Left Behind and state-level accountability programs.",

        "description":"The period of the middle grades has seen numerous reforms to improve education for students in early adolescence. However, although several current reforms seek to overhaul middle schools, only a handful of studies have directly compared the effects of different configurations of grades. Our analysis uses district and student data from one of the few American urban districts that contain both middle schools and K-8 schools. We compare student outcomes in eighth grade, finding few differences by school type. Only self-esteem and perceived threat differ by type of eighth-grade school. We also show that students' self-esteem benefits academic outcomes, a benefit that primarily accrues to students in middle schools.",

When courts lifted Nashville's desegregation order in 1999, the district agreed to implement a new student assignment plan geared toward neighborhood attendance and shorter bus rides--in short, schooling closer to home. The return to neighborhood schools is embedded in widespread assumptions about the power of the neighborhood as a potential source of school improvement and school quality. Neighborhood schools are expected to boost community attachment to schools, encourage resource sharing, and increase parent involvement and social capital. This article explores the implications of schooling closer to home by analyzing neighborhood contexts. What  does \"closer to home\" mean and for whom? Our results suggest that geographic proximity does not necessarily translate into structurally supportive community contexts for children, and black children are much more likely to be reassigned to schools in high-risk neighborhoods as crosstown busing is eliminated.",

This article describes lessons learned from one large urban district's attempts to implement a formative assessment system. Based on interviews with teachers and administrators, the article sheds light on the difficult choices educators face in choosing formative assessments and deciding how to use them.",

In the last two decades, attention has focused especially on the importance of achievement in science and mathematics. Yet, the policy commitments involved have not been based on research evidence. The expansion of cross-national achievement testing in recent decades makes possible longitudinal analyses of the effects of achievement on growth, and we carry out such analyses here. Regression analyses appear to show some effects of science and mathematics achievement on growth, but these effects are due mainly to the inclusion of the four \"Asian Tigers\" and are not consistent over time. These empirical findings call into question educational policy discourse that emphasizes strong causal links between achievement and growth.",

        "description":"Vocational education has a long history of association with differentiated curricula in the American high school. But within the last two decades there has been a movement for curriculum change--a new vocationalism--that has sought to draw the subject closer to the dominant academic mainstream. This study of high school principals (n = 665) explored whether the new shift in curriculum thinking is being accompanied by changes in how students are assigned to curriculum tracks. More particularly, it explored whether racial and socioeconomic factors continue to influence tracking and to dictate which students get vocational education and whether these same demographic factors also influence the expectations held by principals about the likely postschool destination of graduates. Findings are that indeed race and socioeconomic status significantly influence both track assignment and principals' expectations in a way that conforms to the principle of self-fulfilling prophecy. The findings did not support the view that ethnic and racial minorities are more likely than white students to be placed in the vocational track; however, there was strong evidence of such differentiation with respect to the general track.",

This pattern is not explained by academic performance, and, furthermore, African American males receive less benefit from high math grades.

This article uses the Schools and Staffing Survey merged with state-level data collected for &quot;Education Week's&quot; &quot;Quality Counts&quot; reports to examine the impact of state policy on beginning teacher turnover. States that mandate participation in induction programs tend to have more beginning teachers mentored, although state-level funding for these programs is not associated with increased mentorship. Requiring that beginning teachers and their mentors be matched by subject, grade, or school does not appear to ensure such a match, although states that have this requirement do have mentorship programs that are more effective at reducing turnover.

Such districts must allocate a portion of their Title 1 funds to free tutoring for low-income students. Providers may be public or private, and parents select providers. This article develops and applies a conceptual framework for analyzing the SES policy. The policy design assumes that parents will be motivated and equipped to act upon their options in the SES marketplace. However, policy implementation depends also on actions of districts and states. While the policy challenges district power, districts enjoy substantial control over implementation, and the federal government has limited enforcement power. Early findings suggest that the impact of the policy is likely to be uneven across the nation.",

Research Methods/Approach: We merge enrollment data from schools with census data on the demographic and economic attributes of residents and examine racial differences in exposure to school poverty. Findings: We find intrasuburban variation, with all racial groups seeing a stark increase in economic school segregation between 2007 and 2018, with Whites experiencing the largest growth in inner suburbs, and Black and Hispanics increasingly disadvantaged in outer suburbs. Implications: Our findings underscore complex forms of suburban disadvantage in rapidly diversifying suburbs.",

        "description":"Purpose: We assess whether school start times predict the engagement and achievement outcomes of middle grades students. Our focus on middle grades is important because biological changes in sleep often begin when adolescents are in middle school and because middle school is a time when more students struggle academically. Research Methods/Approach: We use 6 years (2011-12 through 2016-17) of statewide administrative data from North Carolina to assess how school start times predict the school attendance, disciplinary records, and test scores of middle grades (6-8) students. We estimate a range of models--school fixed effect, student fixed effect, propensity score--and include a rich set of covariates to isolate the impact of start times. Findings: Our school engagement results are somewhat inconsistent but suggest that later start times predict a reduction in absences and suspensions. Later start times consistently predict higher test scores in mathematics and reading. Subgroup analyses return mixed results regarding which students benefit more from later middle school start times. Implications: Our results emphasize the broader connections between health and academic outcomes and indicate that policy makers should delay start times for middle grades students. States can instigate start time changes by incentivizing districts to delay or requiring that districts delay start times. Districts can independently delay their start times. In doing so, it is important that district officials take time to build support for the policy change and think comprehensively about the start times of all--elementary, middle, and high-district schools.",

        "author":["Welsh, Richard O."],
        "description":"Purpose: Racial inequality in school discipline is an important challenge facing educational stakeholders. There is little research on how educators exercise discretion in navigating the disciplinary process from perceived misbehavior to disciplinary consequences. Research Methods/Approach: This study draws primarily on semistructured interviews with district leaders, school administrators, and teachers in an urban emergent district in the southeastern United States to examine how principals, assistant principals, and teachers relate to and interact with each other in determining students' disciplinary consequences. Findings: The findings illustrate the variation of administrators' disciplinary philosophies across interventionist, interactionalist, and noninterventionist tendencies. Relationships and interactions among school leaders and teachers are a major component of the organizational dynamics underlying how perceived misbehavior is handled in schools. School-level decisions about the generation and adjudication of office discipline referrals are the product of interactional patterns and relationships among adults in schools that partly shape discretion and accountability in disciplinary decisions. The findings unearth two key tensions--disciplinary philosophical tensions and discretion and accountability for office discipline referrals tensions--among district leaders, school administrators, and teachers navigating referrals and further disciplinary consequences. Implications: More intensive on-the-job support for both school leaders and teachers is needed to reduce racial inequality in suspensions. Developing the professional capacity of teachers and school leaders through mentoring, coaching, and professional development is crucial to replacing exclusionary discipline with nonpunitive practices. Districts ought to prioritize supporting school leaders in developing and expanding their professional capacity, who in turn support teachers in addressing school discipline challenges.",

Findings: Results suggest that district learning is aided by theoretically driven research that enables practitioners to learn from the clash between their implicit theories and the results surfaced by RA inquiry. Findings further suggest that to support the incremental accumulation of knowledge, RA and district managers need to construct a working field-level theory of improvement that guides inquiry into specific projects and that draws connections among district programs that might otherwise seem unrelated. Implications: Our analysis suggests that for RAs to support districts in learning how to design more equitable systems, they must engage in theoretically driven work that draws connections between the theories of action that inform individual programs and broader theories of improvements. This will require RAs to enhance the theoretical rigor of their work and to enter into more interdependent relationships with districts.",

        "description":"Purpose: Civic education in the United States has received renewed attention in state-level policy making. Yet defining what citizenship education entails has been long-contested terrain. This study explores the extent to which recently adopted civic education state policies are consistent in policy messaging around desired civic outcomes and civic debt. Research Methods/Approach: This study utilized political discourse analysis to analyze all civic education state policies enacted between 2017 and 2020, which included 45 laws from 29 states, through an iterative process of open and focused coding. Findings: The vast majority of policies espoused civic republican goals, with varying degrees to which they addressed civic debt. Liberal citizenship discourses were found in less than one-fourth of policies, and critical discourses were entirely absent. Patterns emerged in civic discourses by state political identity, geographic location, and whether civic debt was addressed. Implications: Findings suggest congruence across state law in stating that the rising generation of citizens should learn about the foundations and function of government, yet a continued disconnect between marginalized youths' lived experiences of disenfranchisement and exclusion from the dominant narrative. The flood of state bills in 2021 seeking to limit the teaching of structural racism and the roots of inequalities seems to push back against &quot;critical&quot; policies that these findings show are not widespread. This calls for future research that examines whether these state-level trends continue amid ongoing battles over the teaching of civics and history in K-12 schools and how state-level civic discourses manifest in civics education policy classroom implementation.",

        "description":"Purpose: Alongside the inequities surfaced by COVID-19, a confluence of demographic and policy-related shifts over the last few decades has elevated the education of multilingual learners (MLs) in state education agency (SEA) leaders' work. This study employs an ecological perspective to examine how SEA leaders promote social justice policy implementation in their efforts to uphold MLs' civil rights under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). Research Methods: Given its embeddedness in a research-practice partnership (RPP) that emphasizes integration of researchers' expertise with SEA leaders' real-world knowledge, the study employs a participatory research approach. Drawing on 23 semistructured interviews with SEA leaders and 20 hours of observations during RPP meetings, the authors engaged in an iterative analysis process involving coding, memoing, and extensive member checking. Findings: Findings show the dual roles that leaders played to uphold the spirit of civil rights law across local education agencies (LEAs) and within SEAs, and they highlight the structural, cultural, and political dynamics that operated to enable or constrain this work. The study also reveals that cross-state collaboration may be a powerful mechanism for upholding ML civil rights in ways that go beyond compliance toward transformation and social justice. Implications: Although ESSA expanded the role of the SEA in policy implementation, little attention has been given to supporting state-level organizational development. Our findings suggest the need to allocate resources to support SEA capacity development. Such support is ever more critical as state systems work to develop coherent and aligned supports in response to COVID-19-related disparities.",

(2) How do such shared purposes influence the strategic giving practiced by foundations that supported that movement? and (3) How are grants strategically distributed to recipients to fulfill or direct these purposes and advance the reform? Methods: Document analysis of 462 Common Core-related grant announcements from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation, the Leona A. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, the Lumina Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation, and The Noyce Foundation helps to show how nonprofit philanthropic foundations provided funding and support to other nonprofit organizations to develop, build support for, and implement the Common Core State Standards on a wide scale. Findings: The findings illustrate a set of common purposes that drove the reform forward and help to refine our understanding of how philanthropic foundations engage with the education policy process using their financial resources. The findings detail the reach and scale of the private financial investment supporting the reform. Implications: The stated purpose of the Common Core State Standards was to boost student achievement and foster efficiency through common resources across states. This study expands research on &quot;strategic giving&quot; in public education policy development and provides context for understanding the long-term benefits of the Common Core to schools and students.",

        "description":"Purpose: Educators increasingly rely on student survey data to assess classroom climate and implementation of ambitious new teaching standards. Aggregates of student survey reports have face validity as indicators of typical student experiences and can reliably distinguish among classrooms and predict valued student outcomes. Investigating within-classroom variation in addition to classroom aggregates can provide important context for interpreting classroom climate data, helping identify differential instructional experiences and perceptions of instruction among different groups and potential issues impeding high-quality learning opportunities for all students. We investigate whether consensus in student survey reports can offer additional evidence to help identify instructional microclimates in science classrooms. Methods: We use a mixed-methods approach combining multilevel regression models with embedded case studies to qualitatively illuminate patterns of within-classroom consensus. Findings: We find relatively low consensus among students on all aspects of classroom climate but not systematic differences in perception based on race, gender, or English learner or socioeconomic status. Holding average climate ratings constant, we found limited evidence that greater consensus was positively associated with observation scores. Our embedded case studies suggest that students in high-consensus classrooms had more opportunities to collaborate and interact, and more formalized opportunities for participation than in low-consensus classrooms. Finally, we find that consensus around classroom climate is not related to student academic outcomes but is positively associated with student growth mindset. Implications: Our findings illustrate potential new ways in which data from student classroom surveys can be used to inform instructional improvement efforts.",

We ask, What individual, school, and social contextual factors explain students' sense of school belonging? How do students from diverse backgrounds understand and experience belonging in school? Findings: We find that students understand belonging as emerging from their own individual characteristics (including newcomer status and identifying as Latinx), the school environment (participation in clubs and class discussion), and their perceptions and experiences of the social context, including incidents of discrimination.

        "description":"This article documents evidence of nonrandom gender sorting across K-12 schools in the United States. The sorting exists among coed schools and at all grade levels, and it is highest in the secondary school grades. We observe some gender sorting across school sectors and types: for instance, males are slightly underrepresented in private schools and charter schools and are substantially overrepresented in irregular public schools, a large share of which educates students with special needs and juvenile justice involvement. Gender sorting within sectors and types is also quite prevalent and appears to be highest within the private schools (where single-sex schools are more common) and irregular public schools. We find that gender sorting is higher in counties that have higher shares of enrollment in private and nonregular public schools. This sorting occurs even though parents have similar stated preferences for school attributes for their sons and daughters. (Contains 5 tables, 1 figure, and 12 notes.)",

        "description":"Numerous studies have examined how grade retention can impede the academic success of those retained students. One uncharted line of research is the spillover effect that retained students may exert on their classmates. The purpose of this study is to evaluate this relationship for students in urban elementary school classrooms. To do so, this study analyzes a longitudinal data set comprising entire populations of five elementary school cohorts within the School District of Philadelphia. Because individual student records can be linked to teacher and classroom data as well as to school, grade, and year identifiers, this study employs a series of multilevel fixed-effects models to address estimation issues regarding omitted variable bias. All results indicate that the effects of having a greater number of grade-retained peers are detrimental to the standardized achievement outcomes of nonretained classmates. Data-driven policy implications are discussed. (Contains 7 tables and 10 notes.)",

        "description":"Over the past 2 years, educational policy makers have focused much of their\nattention on issues related to teacher effectiveness. The Obama Administration has made teacher evaluation and teacher quality a central feature of many of its educational policies, including Race to the Top (RTTT), Investing in Innovation (i3), and the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) grants. In response, many states and school districts are developing measures of teacher effectiveness to reward, tenure, support, and fire teachers. In response to these policies, many observers are raising questions and concerns about the measures of teacher effectiveness that inform high-stakes personnel decisions. Unfortunately, we have little systematic knowledge regarding the properties of most of these measures.\nThis article has two goals: to explore elements of instruction that may be associated with improved student achievement and to examine the domains of teaching skills that are identified in the literature as important to high-quality teaching but that may not be highly correlated with value-added measures of teacher effectiveness.

        "author":["Wong, Lok-Sze"],
        "description":"Purpose: System reforms ask educators within and across organizational levels to interlace their individual practices into a collective practice so they can enact a different, more equitable schooling system for students. System reforms require educators to coordinate their work with their colleagues in ways they are not trained, incentivized, or supported to do, within systems that do not support collective practice. Yet educators' daily practices are the microprocesses that determine whether they accomplish the macro goal of coordinating a system and thus equitable opportunities for students. Research Methods: This embedded longitudinal case study examines changes in educators' mental maps around coordinating their daily practices as they implemented a new system reform, multi-tiered system of supports (MTSS). The observations, interviews, and artifacts document educators' implementation efforts in two elementary schools in the same district for 2 years. Findings: The findings illuminate how the implementation process can be inequitable, affording only some educators with opportunities to develop mental maps about collective practice. Professional learning opportunities that developed mental maps about collective practice possessed six design elements. These opportunities (1) focused on the system reform, (2) were embedded in daily practice, (3) required joint deliberations, (4) required system-wide membership, (5) were ongoing, and (6) occurred on-site. Implications: This article helps policy makers, leaders, and other reformers improve the learning opportunities they provide to educators responsible for coordinating children's learning opportunities. The article also highlights ways that implementation can be more equitable for educators.",

The case drew a wide range of interested groups who weighed in on the policy as amici curiae, &quot;friends of the court,&quot; offering perspectives about the implications of the case and constructing an overall narrative of DACA within policy discourse. Research Methods/Approach: The theoretical framework guiding the study combines Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Undocumented Critical Theory (UndocuCrit). Using this lens, we identified the discourse regarding issues of race and immigration status in the collective story of the DACA policy as told by amici curiae, including multiple educational stakeholders. Through an iterative process, we employed theory- and data-driven coding to qualitatively analyze the 44 briefs amici curiae submitted to the Court. To bolster the trustworthiness of the findings, we engaged in memoing and extensive team discussions. Findings: Our findings revealed the limitations of the story of DACA. Specifically, we identified a color-evasive narrative that failed to account for the complexities of the lives of recipients, emphasized the benefits they brought to the country and others (e.g., monetary), and decentered the recipients' needs and experiences. Implications: Given the significant presence of educational stakeholders, we discuss the implications of a color-evasive narrative that fails to account for recipients' complex lives, emphasizes the benefits to others, and decenters recipients. We note the importance of counternarratives to disrupt majoritarian stories that marginalize undocumented immigrants.",

        "description":"Purpose: With rising numbers of deportations over the last 2 decades, there has been a particular concern among educators and researchers that immigrant-origin students and their peers are experiencing educational consequences due to increased stress, anxiety, and fear of the unknown. This study examined the relationship between immigration enforcement and student achievement in counties across the United States. Research Methods/Approach: Data come from two nationally representative samples of kindergartners, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study--Kindergarten Classes of 1998-99 and 2010, and the number of deportations ordered from each immigration court provided by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. Employing a cross-sectional, longitudinal design, a student, school, and year fixed-effects model was used to examine the association between deportations and achievement in elementary grades, exploiting variation of deportations between counties and years. Findings: The results of the analyses indicated that increases in deportations coincided with declines in Latinx student achievement in math. Declines were most pronounced for Latinx students in urban schools, Latinx English learners, Latinx second-generation immigrant students, and Latinx students attending Title I schools. Declines were not observed in the second term of the Obama presidential administration. Implications: This study adds to the extant body of research detailing who is subject to the educational impacts from immigration enforcement and in what ways, in hopes that future research continues to explore ways to mitigate these consequences for students. Attention from policy makers and educators is needed to mitigate disruptions that deportations introduce into the learning context for young children.",

Research Methods/Approach: Using 5 years of administrative and survey data from Tennessee, we conduct descriptive and regression analyses to document the mobility of classroom teachers, ICs, and TPOs from one year to the next. These outcomes identify if a teacher, IC, or TPO remains in the same school, moves to a new school, becomes a school administrator, or leaves teaching. In a series of ancillary investigations, we examine if mobility patterns depend on their gender and racial/ethnic identities. Findings: ICs and TPOs are no more likely to remain in teaching than full-time classroom teachers. ICs move schools at higher rates than classroom teachers, and ICs and TPOs become school administrators at much higher rates than classroom teachers. Importantly, these transitions into school administration are not equally distributed by race and gender, with ICs of color and male TPOs becoming administrators at the highest rates. Implications: Our findings imply that policy makers may be able to use ICs and TPOs to shape the principal pipeline, including strengthening the instructional expertise and increasing the racial diversity of the administrator corps.",

        "author":["Kolluri, Suneal"],
        "description":"Purpose: Much scholarly hand-wringing has concerned the academic engagement of Black and Latino boys. At the center of these conversations are questions of culture. Cultural disconnects between home and school are profound for students from marginalized communities, particularly so for young men. Prudence Carter asserts that young men in urban settings are more reluctant than their female peers to become &quot;cultural straddlers&quot;--students who adeptly navigate the cultural distance between school and urban communities. However, many Black and Latino boys succeed in school. This article will interrogate why some young men acquiesce to the cultural expectations of schooling, whereas others do not. Research Methods/Approach: Leveraging relational ethnographic methods, this article details the relationships, experiences, and masculine identities of two groups of young men--the Alpha Gentlemen fraternity and the Serpents of Steel Robotics team. Findings: This article argues that whether cultures of masculine play and toughness fit in academic settings depends on how masculinity is molded in relational contexts. Although dominant ideologies of masculinity--including play and competition--were significant in both groups, how the young men played and competed within their relational networks shaped identities that were more or less capable of straddling the cultures of home and school. Implications: The findings here elaborate Carter's framing of boys' cultural straddling, with implications for enhancing academic engagement among young Black and Latino men.",

(b) To what extent does school academic and disciplinary climate explain variation in mathematics achievement growth among schools? (c) To what extent do students' and schools' demographic characteristics explain this variation? While previous studies have examined the effects of school climate on student achievement in middle school and high school, the present study is focused on the effect of school academic and disciplinary climate on students' mathematics learning in the first 4 years of schooling--from fall of kindergarten to spring of third grade. We found that students' mathematics achievement growth varies significantly among schools and that students' improvement in mathematics achievement over time was higher in schools characterized by a stronger climate, above and beyond students' and schools' demographic characteristics.

        "description":"A growing number of parents--particularly middle- and upper-middle-class parents--are working to fill budgetary gaps through their fundraising, grant writing, and volunteerism in urban public schools. Yet little is known about how this may shape norms and practices related to parental engagement within particular schools. Drawing from a case study of an elementary school undergoing demographic shifts in its student population, this article examines the scope and consequences of middle-class parents' collective engagement. The research reveals that parents brought new resources and educational opportunities to the school, yet their engagement through the parent-teacher organization (PTO) and the school's reliance on their contributions engendered tensions and exacerbated existing status positions among parents. The findings highlight the limitations of positioning middle-class parental engagement as a key intervention strategy in urban education. (Contains 4 tables and 8 notes.)",

        "description":"A growing body of school choice research has shown that when school choice policies are not designed to racially or socioeconomically integrate schools, that is, are &quot;colorblind&quot; policies, they generally manage to do the opposite, leading to greater stratification and separation of students by race and ethnicity across schools and programs. Since white, advantaged parents are more likely to get their children into the highest-status schools regardless of the school choice policy in place, we believed that more research was needed on how those parents interact with school choice policies and whether they would support changes to those policies that would lead to less segregation across schools. Our interviews with advantaged New York City parents suggest that many are bothered by the segregation but that they are concerned that their children gain access to the &quot;best&quot; (mostly white) schools. The contradictions inherent in their choices are reconcilable, we argue, by offering more diverse and undivided school options. (Contains 3 tables and 1 note.)",

We then apply this analysis to the United States, a rich but unequal country where ability-based tracking is common.

Research Approach: Using a conceptual framework rooted in incrementalism--a theory suggesting that policy makers often make decisions reflecting the status quo--we conducted a rigorous conventional content analysis on the plans that states created in response to ESSA. Findings: Our findings suggest that many SEAs practiced incrementalism with few changes in the categories of improvement supports that SEAs offered to their underperforming schools and districts and the methods by which SEAs offered those improvement supports. Similar to prior years, most SEAs focused improvement supports on improvement planning processes and appeared to provide those supports using mostly passive methods like online resource hubs and document templates. Implications: We discuss how SEAs--even if they lack capacity--occupy powerful positions to amplify the voices and needs of underperforming schools and districts. This study substantiates a scarce literature on SEAs and provides updated insight into how SEAs have espoused to respond to federal demands to improve underperforming schools and districts.",

In this study, we evaluate whether the existing formula equitably distributes IDEA funding and show how potential future funding increases would be allocated. Research Methods/Approach: We apply concepts and empirical methods used in K-12 education finance policy research to evaluate the extent of existing variation in federal grant aid among states and whether systematic differences exist among states in the allocation of IDEA funding according to relevant need and other factors. Policy simulations illustrate how the distribution of funding among states will be affected by proposed increases in IDEA appropriations if the current formula is used. Findings: The existing formula results in substantial disparities among states and systematically disadvantages large states and states with more poor, disabled, and non-White children. Policy simulations show that increasing federal funding without modifying the formula used to calculate state grants will perpetuate and even exacerbate existing funding disparities. Simply adding additional dollars to existing appropriations without modifying the current formula works against policy makers' goals to equitably distribute IDEA funding to states. Implications: Moving forward, achieving goals for equitably allocating IDEA funding will require changes to the statutory formula used to calculate states' grant allocations.",

Research Methods: Using semistructured interviews, participants' perspectives were explored and compared in relation to their vision of SEW, implementation of strategies, evidence-based practice, professional development, and policies used to promote SEW. Findings: Findings suggest that all stakeholder groups believe SEW to be an essential component of the everyday lived experience of schools. The importance of positive culture, explicit skills, embedded practices, and proactive support for successful student and teacher outcomes was highlighted in all stakeholder group interviews. A coordinated approach for a safe environment with clear expectations, sound support, and explicit skills is essential.

        "description":"This article employs historical methodology to explore the evolution of Grow Your Own (GYO) teacher programs. These initiatives, which continue to rank among the most popular methods of teacher recruitment, originated as &quot;future teacher&quot; clubs designed to attract students into the profession during a severe staffing shortage that occurred during the 1940s and 1950s. In that era, recruiters attempted to hook students with appeals to the joy of working with children and a conservative version of public service. During the 1970s, recruiters shifted their language to reflect the emergence of a more progressive iteration of youth culture. However, when viewed over the long term, the newer invocations of teacher activism seem like a reformulation of traditional appeals to patriotism. In particular, supporters of GYO programs continued to hope that rural students and students of color would be especially receptive to a nonmaterial emphasis on civic duty. Despite these earnest efforts, future teacher clubs had a relatively modest impact on recruitment. This history provides a cautionary reminder of a widespread tendency to attribute teacher behavior to personal qualities rather than structural forces.",

Home visiting, for example, is associated with valuable outcomes for children and families and for teachers. Less attention has focused on the content of the visits themselves or on the power dynamics within those visits. Research Methods: This study investigates how teams of teachers in two states positioned themselves and their students' families--who were marginalized by virtue of their linguistic, socioeconomic, or ethnic/racial identities--during 25 home visits. Findings: Data indicate that teachers generally took charge, reinforcing traditional dynamics. However, there were rare moments where teachers or families positioned the families as experts, allowing teachers to learn from and collaborate with families. Implications: This study has implications for how teachers are trained to engage with families in service of children from marginalized families and for future research on the practice of home visiting.",

        "description":"Purpose: Research on privileged parents, defined here as those with the economic, social, and educational resources to navigate school choice processes to their advantage, often depicts such parents as anxious about maintaining social mobility, leading them to &quot;opportunity hoard&quot; desirable or academically competitive schools in ways that exclude other families. In contrast, we identify a subset of privileged parents in urban settings that we term &quot;happiness-oriented parents&quot; who seek schools that prioritize their child's social-emotional happiness. Research Methods: Using a qualitative meta-analysis combining seven studies conducted by the authors in New York City; Hartford, Connecticut; and a small East Coast city between 2012 and 2021, we reanalyzed interview data from semistructured interviews with 106 privileged parents who have the ability to access and navigate a range of school choice options. Findings: We found a happiness orientation in a diverse group of privileged parents (40% identified as Black, Latinx, Asian American, or multiracial, and the remaining 60% were white). Although these parents were choosing a range of school options in different contexts and they identified different criteria as important to cultivating happiness, they consistently (1) centered happiness, (2) chose for social-emotional and noncompetitive academic factors, and (3) saw this choice as different from the norm. Implications: In identifying this repeated but understudied phenomenon, we consider that happiness-oriented parents' choices might affect a range of education policy changes and outcomes. In the case of our studies, we examine the potential of these parents as allies in school integration efforts.",

        "description":"Purpose: We describe charter school leaders' beliefs and practices as they relate to student transportation in three choice-rich cities. Research Methods/Approach: Data come from a multiple comparative case study of district and charter school leaders' perceptions and implementation of transportation policies in three choice-rich cities with distinct student-transportation requirements, geographic landscapes, and school-choice markets. We analyzed public documentation and individual, semistructured interviews with 26 representatives from charter schools, authorizing agencies, and district administrators across the case sites. Findings: Even with local policies requiring universal transportation in two of our three case cities, charter school leaders did not foreground equity goals in school access when discussing transportation or did so in relatively weak ways. In contrast, all three cities showed evidence of market-based principles that, at times, were coupled with state and community values to bolster the legitimacy of market-driven transportation practices at the expense of equity goals. Despite the prevalence of the market-based values, we argue that local regulations and structures can support equitable transportation practices. Implications: Our results highlight the strong influence of market-based principles on charter school practices for student transportation. Without equitable provision of student transportation, the theory of change of school choice--that families will have equal access to schools--is challenged. State- and district-level regulations (such as transportation mandates) and structures (such as public transit and universal enrollment systems) can elevate goals of equity for charter school leaders or help manage competitive forces that compel charter schools to prioritize market-based goals over equity.",

Research Methods: This work is part of a larger, multiple-case study examining how schools support academic achievement for economically disadvantaged students. We draw on qualitative interview and observation data from seven purposively sampled public elementary schools in Wisconsin during the 2017-18 school year. In our analysis, we approach each school as an individual case to ascertain how resources and organizational decisions shaped instructional coordination for Tier 2 interventions within the RtI framework. Findings: We find that organizational contexts shape how schools approach the instructional coordination of staffing and schedules requisite for multitiered instruction. Specifically, local programming, delineation of staff roles, and availability and deployment of school resources influenced if and how schools coordinated staff and schedules to support RtI. These elements consequently informed student groupings for interventions, the extent of student access to Tier 1 and Tier 2 content, and staff engagement in data-driven discussions. Implications: By closely examining the everyday realities of diverse elementary schools, this study demonstrates that RtI is not a singular program but a context-contingent process. In tracing the relationships between school contexts, instructional coordination, and the practical implementation of RtI, we provide insight into the messy realities of schools and obstacles to RtI that past research overlooks. These findings emphasize the importance of systematic, school-wide coordination that extends beyond single grade levels and subjects.",

        "description":"Purpose: Many US school districts currently face teacher-retention issues, raising questions about which new teachers might remain long term in district schools. Positing that a teacher's local ties matter, this quantitative analysis was designed to compare the long-term retention of community-based teachers to community outsiders in the school district that recruited them and subsidized their initial training. Research Methods/Approach: To understand the extent to which individual preparation approaches might distribute different retention benefits to different teacher subgroups, the study examined teacher preparation as an interactive system. Drawing on administrative data from New York City Public Schools and project survey data, the study used logistic regression to model the 3-, 5-, and 8-year retention of 617 secondary mathematics teachers who entered teaching through a high-profile alternative teacher-certification program. Findings: Community insiders--defined in this study as the graduates of New York City high schools--had markedly and significantly estimated higher odds of district retention than that of community outsiders at all three points in time. Black community insiders who entered teaching with prior career experience were shown to have particularly high odds of retention in the district. Implications: The results indicate that the recruitment and development of community-based teachers, and particularly those who are Black career changers, promise to improve retention in district schools. They also support the thesis that retention and other program-level outcomes are the product of interactions between certain types of teachers working in particular (e.g., highly racially segregated) schools and the initial training they receive in teacher-certification programs.",

        "description":"Purpose: This study draws on genre theory to analyze the linguistic and discursive presentation of the self in successful US college application essays. Research Methods: We used qualitative discourse analysis informed by the systemic functional linguistic concepts of field, tenor, and mode to analyze 20 sample application essays identified as exemplary by college admissions staff from 4 US colleges, along with essay-writing advice obtained from websites of 12 US universities. Our analysis aimed to specify (1) the characteristics of the self that are represented in successful essays and (2) how the writers linguistically and discursively construct these characteristics. Findings: Successful essays portrayed a unique and authentic self through distinctive, patterned features that spanned the three categories of field, tenor, and mode. Features related to &quot;field&quot; included extended metaphors representing insights gained from learning and experience, language representing niche interests, verbs suggesting learning or change, and appraisal language positioning the writer as charitable and optimistic; features related to &quot;tenor&quot; did not include direct address or questions but rather implicit persuasion through descriptive representation of the writer's character; and features related to &quot;mode&quot; included micronarratives, extended metaphors that supported cohesion, and syntactic structures that facilitated contrast of the writer's self before and after a significant moment of learning. Implications: As colleges move away from requiring standardized tests for admission, the importance of college application essays has increased. Our findings contribute to efforts to make successful performance of this high-stakes genre more attainable, particularly for first-generation and underrepresented students applying to college.",

Yet most neglect student agency and sociocultural variation in the operationalization of STRs. This study explores the specific actions teachers and students take to build positive STRs from the vantage point of a diverse group of US middle and high school students. Research Methods: Drawing on the principles of critical collaborative research, our intergenerational team of scholars engaged 84 youth participants (ages 12-18) in qualitative data generation and analysis, using novel youth-voice elicitation techniques known as the fishbone and diamond card sort. Findings: Findings highlight specific actions that a diverse group of youth believe students and teachers take to create positive STRs and foreground the importance of teacher power, student responsibility, safe classrooms, and reciprocity in STR construction. Implications: By pinpointing specific actions that teachers can take to build positive STRs, this work raises implications for teacher education and professional development, especially as schools struggle to regain ground with students in the wake of COVID-19 disruptions. In addition, the study demonstrates how engaging youth as partners in qualitative research can help improve the conduct and products of empirical research in education, offering a model for the field of youth validation processes.",
