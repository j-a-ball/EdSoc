    <str name="description">This paper examines how affirmative action in Brazilian public universities has evolved from the start of the new millennium up to recent years. After an overview of the existing policies in public universities, we explain these patterns based on an analysis of the processes internal and external to the universities. Although these policies were initially thought of as racial quotas, class-based criteria have predominated, while the racial criteria became relatively circumscribed. Within the institutions, affirmative action brought new concerns about how to support and retain low-income students, as well as a discussion about racism, although the latter remains controversial.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This study investigates the links between race, school choice and educational stratification in South Africa. It focuses on racial differences in families' efforts to take advantage of choice by transferring to opportunity (i.e., transferring to a school perceived to offer students better access to educational opportunity than their current school) and explores the implications of those transfers for emerging patterns of racial stratification in access to high quality schools. Findings reveal significant racial variation in transfers to opportunity and suggest a complex link between race and the ways in which historically disadvantaged groups have engaged with the post-apartheid educational opportunity structure.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article will examine Asian women's experiences of financial support in higher education. The article is based on 30 in-depth interviews with Asian women who were studying at a &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; (post-1992) university in the South East of England. Women identified themselves as Muslim, Hindu and Sikh. The findings reveal that women's religious and cultural background affects their attitudes towards financial support whilst at university. Through their participation in higher education, women are able to use their social and ethnic capital to enable them to receive financial and other kinds of support necessary for their success in higher education.</str>

    <str name="description">The continued gender imbalance in senior positions in higher education is a problem that persists despite decades of feminist research and publications in the area, as well as interventions in many countries to promote the advancement of women. In this article we view the issue of gender inequality through the lens of the prestige economy, which suggests that academics are motivated by prestige factors accrued through advancement in their careers. Prestige, authority and status, we suggest, may be more easily acquired by male academics. We draw on a case study of one institution in the Republic of Ireland, including data from a survey on academic careers (n = 269), to explore how the concept of prestige is gendered. We explore the cumulative effect of four themes: homosociability; non-transparency of criteria; academic workload balance; and self-promotion.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper argues that whereas the social relevance of attitudes towards education is commonly confined to their direct impact on educational aspirations or attainment, attitudes may also impact on educational success in a way similar to cultural capital. Survey data were used to assess the support for three different attitudes with respect to the perceived value of attending school among youngsters (n = 853) following secondary education in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium). The results revealed substantial differences according to the pupils' cultural capital, time perspective, personal educational experiences and social mobility. These findings are taken as a starting point for a broader discussion about how attention to attitudes may enable us to account for the power struggles in which the educational field and the teaching profession are involved.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Children, and schools, are potent symbols of victimhood in industrial disasters. In the case of historical industrial disasters such as Aberfan and Flixborough, and in terms of preparation for future industrial disasters under Control of Major Accident Hazard regulations, communities are seen as passive responders to accidents. Moreover, following industrial accidents, communities are frequently accused of culpability or profiting from the disaster. There is hence a double pathologisation in play, with communities seen as comprising passive victims and manipulative survivors. Using an historical approach, the official accounts of the Aberfan and Flixborough industrial accidents are challenged with a focus on schools and children. Rather than being passive victims of these accidents, schools and children demonstrated agency in terms of their tacit knowledge, reporting potential accidents and recording their consequences. This provides a lens through which to interrogate current policy on industrial safety as it relates to schools and communities.</str>

      <str>Courtney, Steven J.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In this paper, I draw on a study of school leaders' experiences of inspection to argue that repeated changes to school inspection policy in England constitute a post-panoptic regime. Thinking with and against Foucault, I elaborate post-panopticism, here characterised by: subjects' visibility; &amp;quot;fuzzy&amp;quot; norms; the exposure of subjects' failure to comply; the disruption of identity-constituting fabrications; its dependence on external &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot;; and its neo-conservative devalorisation of the interests of the socio-economically disadvantaged. The paper argues that post-panopticism depends on subjects having become disciplined through panopticism, whose apparatus it employs, and reveals the state's explicit exercise of power.</str>

    <str name="title">Recruiting Young Volunteers in an Area of Selective Education: A Qualitative Case Study</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Dean, Jon</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article presents findings from a small qualitative case study of a youth volunteering brokerage organisation in England, operating in an area of selective state education. Data show how brokerage workers felt grammar schools managed their students in a concerted way to improve students' chances of attending university. Conversely, workers expressed difficulty in working with comprehensive schools, feeling they were less willing to utilise volunteering services. These impressions lead the volunteering organisation to focus intently on recruiting potential volunteers from local grammar schools. As a result there is a need to reframe current debates in the sociology of education around institutional habitus, with a focus on the perceived habitus/doxa of schools. It is ultimately this (mis)recognition of institutional practices that leads to unequal policy outcomes, in this case reinforcing the advantage of academically elite students attending grammar schools.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores the contrasting predispositions of a group of working-class and middle-class undergraduates to using nepotism to gain advantage in the labour market. Drawing upon a Bourdieusian framework, it is argued that the middle-class students, whose habitus was aligned to the field, were more likely to express a willingness to utilise whatever networks they could to secure a &amp;quot;foot in the door.&amp;quot; Meanwhile, the working-class students, who were more insecure about the legitimacy of their participation within a middle-class field, expressed a commitment to a form of honour which ruled out using contacts on the grounds that it was morally unacceptable. They discussed a desire to &amp;quot;prove themselves&amp;quot; which is arguably symptomatic of a deeply ingrained reliance on meritocracy. I explore how this may arise due to their habitus having developed within a dominated position in society where respectability is crucial to generating feelings of self-worth and value.</str>

      <str>Atkins, Liz</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Little work on the significance and implications of decision-making has been undertaken since that led by Hodkinson in the 1990s, and the experiences of young people on vocational programmes and their reasons for undertaking them remain under-theorised and poorly understood. Drawing on two narratives from a study exploring young people's motivations for undertaking vocational programmes, this article explores the relationship between their positioning in fields and career decision-making. The article argues that social positioning is significant in its relationship to decision-making, to the way in which young people perceive and construct their careers and to the influence of serendipity on their transitions. Drawing on a range of international studies, the article explores the implications of these findings in terms of young people's future engagement with the global labour market, giving consideration to (dissonant) perceptions of vocational education and training as contributing to economic growth whilst addressing issues of social exclusion and promoting social justice.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Morrice, Linda</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Debates about integration, British values and identity, who can belong and who can become a citizen, have been fuelled by concerns about growing cultural diversity in the United Kingdom. To promote a shared sense of national identity and claim a universal and normative citizen subject, the UK government, along with many other western nations, has introduced compulsory citizenship and language testing. This article traces and critiques the evolution of the British citizenship test since its introduction in 2005 and argues that the regime fails to recognise the gendered and segmented nature of migration, and functions as a silent and largely invisible mechanism of civic stratification and control. Drawing on Home Office data, it is argued that citizenship testing enables the government to cherry pick migrants who conform to an idealised citizen subject, while containing cultural difference by excluding others, particularly women, who are tolerated but remain symbolic non-citizens.</str>

    <str name="description">Despite rates of participation in post-compulsory full-time education reaching approximately 84% in Wales, social class inequalities continue to shape young people's transitions from compulsory to post-compulsory education. This article draws upon data from a project which explored how young people's educational decisions and transitions in Wales, UK are influenced by national economic landscapes, the popular narratives framing them and the structure of local employment opportunities. The analyses revealed that young people from similar social class backgrounds, but living in different localities, make very different sorts of transition from compulsory to post-compulsory education; in essence, they are either &amp;quot;pushed&amp;quot; or they &amp;quot;jump&amp;quot; into post-16 education. The article aims overall to contribute both empirically and theoretically to understandings of the complexity of educational decision-making, revealing how class and location intersect to frame decision-making processes, in so doing producing and reproducing educational inequalities.</str>

    <str name="description">This article provides insights into teachers' and school administrators' responses to the current &amp;quot;fetishisation&amp;quot; of school performance data in Australian schooling. Specifically, the research investigates the accountability practices that emerged in a Queensland metropolitan primary school in response to this broader focus upon performance data. Drawing upon interviews with teachers and school administrators, literature and theorising on educational performativity and data, and Bourdieu's theory of practice, the article reveals how performative, data-driven practices play out at the level of the school. This process reveals a &amp;quot;field of schooling practices&amp;quot; characterised by contradictory and contested logics of deifying, delivering and denying data. We describe this as the &amp;quot;doublethink of data,&amp;quot; involving teachers engaging with performative processes for purposes of compliance but without any real sense of the value of doing so. The research reveals the extraordinary energy involved in this work, and cautions against these performative practices and associated technologies.</str>

    <str name="title">Mainland Chinese Students at an Elite Hong Kong University: Habitus-Field Disjuncture in a Transborder Context</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Xu, Cora Lingling</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Drawing on in-depth interview data from 31 mainland Chinese (MLC) students in a Hong Kong university, this article conceptualises MLC and Hong Kong higher education as two dissonant but interrelated subfields of the Chinese higher education field. The article argues that these MLC students' habitus, one that possesses rich economic, social and cultural capital, prompts a strong sense of entitlement to anticipated privileges. However, this sense of entitlement is disrupted by the differential capital valuations across these fields. There is thus notable habitus-field disjuncture, which, exacerbated by the hysteresis effect, gives rise to a sense of disappointment and ambivalence. This article demonstrates how the Hong Kong education credential, which these students initially set out to pursue as a form of capital, can become a disadvantage at multiple levels; the article illustrates that capital valuation and conversion in a transborder context is not a straightforward, but rather a complicated and sometimes contradictory, process.</str>

    <str name="description">This article investigates to what extent scholarships are unequally distributed among students in Germany and how these inequalities can be explained. Following sociological theory, the article argues that elites seek qualitative ways of distinguishing themselves in a mass higher education system. Using student surveys, we demonstrate that class effects cannot merely be explained with reference to class differences in academic achievement but that higher classes have better access to scholarships independent of earlier school performance. Class differences were particularly persistent when the intermediate classes were compared with higher classes with more education. These findings illustrate that social classes have different strategies when it comes to participating in higher education and suggest that information about and access to scholarships is important in gaining a class advantage.</str>

    <str name="description">Empirical studies have repeatedly shown that in Germany educational success still strongly depends on the social origin of individuals. Using the National Educational Panel Study, we analyse the effects of fathers' and mothers' education levels on their sons' and daughters' educational attainments across three successive birth cohorts in West Germany. We calculate the predicted probabilities of reaching low, medium or high education levels on the basis of the level of education of the mothers and the fathers. Our results show: a persistence of the status maintenance model, with very few exceptions; a growth in the educational level of women via medium-level education connected to segregation in the labour market; and finally that the first transition of girls to medium-level education has been completed, leaving space for daughters to attempt to outnumber sons in tertiary education, mainly due to the pressure of mothers.</str>

    <str name="description">This article employs Bourdieu's conceptual tools to unpack family influences on students' subject and university choices in China. This empirical study employed mixed research approaches, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, to examine students' choices of subjects and universities in a sample of secondary school students from the age of 16 to 18 in China. This study reveals that while there are few class differences in subject choice, students' choices of a selected university is significantly associated with higher family income level. The data show that the probability of entering a top university for students from high-income families is greater than that of students from low-income families.</str>

      <str>Youdell, Deborah</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article makes a case for biosocial education as a field of research and as a potential framework for education practice. The article engages with sociology of education's contemporary interests in embodiment and affect, the possibilities offered by concept studies, and uses of assemblage and complexity theory for thinking about educational phenomena. It also considers broader social science and political theory engagements with epigenetics and neuroscience. The article examines the legacy of the biology/sociology split and the risks, limits, and potentialities of degrounded collaborative trans-disciplinary biosocial research. It considers developments in biosciences that may have particular resonance and promise for education, in particular the epigenetics of care and stress and the metabolomics of diet. The article argues that sociology of education should engage with bioscience to interrogate the folding together of the social, cultural, biographical, pedagogic, political, affective, neurological, and biological in the interactive production of students and learning.</str>

    <str name="description">Studies of migrant pupils in schools have paid little attention to people with special educational needs and/or disabilities, reflecting a broader normative ableism of existing scholarship. This article, based on a case study of a special school in the east of England, explores the perspectives of staff and new migrants on their experiences. The article exposes how migrant families' interactions with schools were shaped both by their previous migration histories and current broader processes of &amp;quot;integration&amp;quot;. Teachers were empathetic and supportive, but it was the extended remit of the work of migrant and minority staff (including translation and wider caring roles) that proved particularly vital for families. We employ an intersectional approach to interpret these encounters, exposing the tensions and dilemmas arising. Further research is needed to develop understanding and critical engagement with the challenges facing these families, arising from the specific intersections of disability, migration, social class and gender.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Keddie, Amanda</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article presents interview data from a study involving nine primary school leaders. Five are leaders of local authority schools while four are leaders of schools within a large academy chain. The article examines their perspectives about the current regimes of performativity in the English education context and, in particular, the accountability demands of Ofsted. Mindful of contemporary concerns about the tensions between performativity and professionalism in education, the analysis highlights the different ways in which each group responds to external accountability demands. The article illustrates how investments in traditional and entrepreneurial professionalism continue to impact on how the current demands of performativity are understood. It highlights the significance of conceptualising educator professionalism beyond dichotomies that idealise the former at the expense of the latter and the importance of an ongoing critical focus on the ways in which professionalism is currently being articulated in schools.</str>

    <str name="description">Hyper-femininity and the construction of the &amp;quot;girly girl&amp;quot; label have been documented widely, but there has been less attention to their content (or any distinctions between these constructs). Indeed, it can be argued that the content of femininity remains a controversial and somewhat under-researched topic in feminist scholarship. This is also the case in relation to science, which has been widely characterised as a masculine terrain, but there has been less attention to why femininity is excluded from/by science. This article attempts to unpick some of these issues, with a particular focus on the construct of the &amp;quot;girly girl&amp;quot;, in relation to access to science. Drawing on qualitative data from the Economic and Social Research Council-funded ASPIRES 2 project, we analyse the discourses used by young people and parents in discussion of &amp;quot;girly girls&amp;quot; and physics. We show the misogynist and excluding discourses projected onto the &amp;quot;girly girl&amp;quot;, and indeed that are used to interpolate femininity more broadly. We found that in discussions of science and (hyper-)femininity, even potentially positive feminine attributes were denigrated. Hyper-femininity was produced as &amp;quot;more than lack&amp;quot;: vacuous, but also a risible presence. In reflecting on our findings we consider whether femininity may be more derided in some discursive contexts (e.g. science discourse) than others, and whether femininity can or should be conceived as more than lack.</str>

    <str name="description">The neoliberal turn in public education positions the parent as a consumer within an expanding educational marketplace. This shift is premised on the notion that the free market is best suited to promote equity. Critics of this claim highlight how a larger choice arena creates additional opportunities for privileged parents to mobilize their resources to further their child's advantages. While extremely important, this framework of analysis ignores the role that educational choice plays in producing parent subjectivities. In this article, we explore how parents at one specialized arts high school construct notions of the &amp;quot;good/moral&amp;quot; parent around the decision to &amp;quot;choose the arts,&amp;quot; and how these categories work to reinforce dominant race, class, and gender hierarchies within the school. We hope to illuminate how educational choice is not solely about shaping the material and symbolic conditions of the child; it is about producing parent subjectivities as well.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Cui, Dan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article examines the school experiences of Chinese Canadian youth, a population often ignored by the academy under the model minority discourse. Drawing on Bourdieu's theoretical insights, I raise and discuss the concept of teachers' racialised habitus. I explore how teachers' racialised habitus structures their practices of knowledge construction via formal and hidden curricula, and how it consequently affects Chinese Canadian youth's identity construction. I argue that habitus, as an important theoretical tool that links the social and the individual as well as past, present and future, can also be used to study other forms of social inequality beyond class. This article makes both theoretical and empirical contributions to the research on habitus by highlighting teachers' racialised habitus in relation to the perpetuation of racism in the educational field.</str>

      <str>Hein, Nina</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores the subject of parents with respect to children's bullying at school. The overarching claim is that parental agency and positions on children's bullying at school are produced and made possible by an apparatus of multiple, concurrent forces that provide poor conditions for a constructive partnership between parents and schools in cases of bullying. This research adds to the existing literature in the field by suggesting that the connections between schools, parents and their children's social behaviour at school must be seen as complexly entangled and involving a range of forces at local, societal and political levels. Furthermore, based on an emergent research design, the article contributes to the discussion of post-qualitative research, drawing upon varied, qualitative empirical material and analytically experimenting with combining Adele Clarke's idea of situational analysis and Karen Barad's concepts of intra-action and apparatus.</str>

    <str name="description">While an extensive body of research has examined the role of cultural capital in reproducing social class inequality in educational outcomes, the role of habitus and school context has received less attention in quantitative studies. We attend to this gap in the literature by considering the relationship between cultural capital, habitus, and the transition into higher education across high schools with low and high college-going cultures in the United States. Findings indicate that the relationship between cultural capital and transition into higher education is context specific and manifested only in schools with a high college-going culture. In addition, students from less advantaged family backgrounds benefit more from cultural capital than their more advantaged counterparts, but this is the case primarily in schools with a high college-going culture. Habitus, however, is related to the transition into higher education regardless of the high school context and benefits all students equally.</str>

    <str name="description">Studies of young people's experiences of parental influence on their educational choice in different family contexts are lacking. This study explores such experiences among youth in Norway, where educational choice is normatively construed as an autonomous decision. The article draws on data from a survey of 2029 youths that includes open-ended qualitative descriptions of experiences of difficult decisions. The analyses show no differences in experiences of parental influences related to social class. Minority students experience their parents as positive/supportive to the same degree as majority students but as more strongly influencing the decision-making process. Nevertheless, minority and majority youth express having made their own choice to the same extent. Negative and strong parental opinions sometimes complicate the choosing process and threaten young people's sense of autonomy. In the case of youths' indecision and need for guidance, parental involvement may be a precondition for a young person's ability to make an autonomous decision.</str>

      <str>Beilmann, Mai</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Although it is arguably a fundamental democratic or human right of a child to feel safe at school, many children and adolescents have to face peer victimisation in schools on a daily basis, and occasionally through several levels of education. Long-term victimisation may have detrimental consequences for the victim, including a negative effect on educational attainment. This study provides an insight into the lives of five young people who have dropped out or are at risk of dropping out from Estonian vocational schools because of peer victimisation. The study is based on in-depth face-to-face personal interviews. Four superordinate themes with associated subthemes are addressed: &amp;quot;experience of victimisation&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;'social context&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;lack of support&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;quitting as a survival strategy&amp;quot;. The stories of the bullying victims reveal how the victimisation has shaped them and their educational pathways by compelling them to discontinue their vocational training.</str>

    <str name="description">Despite rapid growth at the 12-year compulsory education stage, Hong Kong's non-Chinese language minority students make up only 1.3% of the whole full-time postsecondary student population; their attendance rate is 13.8%, far behind the overall rate of 43.8%. Policy and research focus on their secondary school graduation with a widely recognized nexus between Chinese language deficiency and academic underachievement. Yet lower participation rates in postsecondary education (PSE) and nonlinguistic risk factors that account for under-representation have received scarce regional attention. The current study attempts to fill this gap. Utilizing the multiplicity and convertibility of capital in the Bourdieusian conception, this study elicits non-Chinese language minority students' voices and identifies the interplay effects of multiple capitals on the participants' pathways to PSE. Findings provide insights into the dynamic processes of convertible capitals and accessing PSE when developing holistic policies that are able to address linguistic and non-linguistic hurdles in the college choice process.</str>

    <str name="description">This article aims to revisit the relationship between school-level variables and students' educational opportunities through the lens of institutional habitus. This approach is particularly well suited to explore the notion of school culture because it brings to the forefront the impact of social context, avoiding some of the limitations typically associated with the long-dominant perspective of school effectiveness research. Drawing on an ethnographic approach, the article explores how institutional habitus unfolds in two urban public secondary schools in the city of Barcelona. Breaking the notion down into three main components (educational status, organizational practices and expressive order), the analysis identifies two main types of institutional habitus--one based on action and inclusion, and another based on reaction and expulsion. Ultimately, these results give insight into the complex interplay of these three components, as well as on their combined impact on students' educational opportunities.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article argues for the importance of studying the moral meanings that young people attach to their aspirations and plans for the future. Drawing on semi-structured interview data with 29 young people from a sixth-form college in a disadvantaged area of East London, I show that aspirations are closely connected to the formation of individual and group identities, and the making of inter-group boundaries. I argue that young people develop aspirations as part of a normatively evaluative narrative about who they are and the kind of person they hope to become. Focusing on moral meanings helps us to better understand young peoples' range of motivations for pursuing particular goals, and may help to explain why aspirations can remain high even in the absence of capitals, resources, or opportunities.</str>

    <str name="description">Despite a long-standing concern within the sociology of education for ameliorating educational inequality, the challenge of improving educational opportunities for disadvantaged students remains deeply entrenched. While 'macro' issues such as segregation and systemic inequalities in school funding and access to qualified teachers must be addressed as matters of social and educational justice, Basil Bernstein's novel focus on &amp;quot;relations within&amp;quot; education as the site of pedagogic discourse offers teachers and those working inside school systems a particularly powerful vision for promoting more equitable outcomes for students. This paper examines this assertion through a case study of the &amp;quot;mixed&amp;quot; pedagogical practice of a successful teacher in a fifth-grade urban classroom in the United States.</str>

    <str name="description">This study compares the educational attainment of Muslim and Christian White-British boys and girls at the following junctions: Key Stage 2, Key Stage 3, GCSE, getting into universities and achieving a place at a Russell Group university. The study utilises the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England waves 1-6 with linked data from the National Pupil Database. The analysis shows that once we take previous school performance into account, Muslim students seem to be performing as well as the majority group, even in attending Russell group universities. Muslim girls seem to now be outperforming Muslim boys, especially in relation to their school performance. Furthermore, parental expectations and students' own expectations play an important role in determining the attainment of students. The study concludes that the higher achievement of young Muslims may be strongly correlated with their own unusually high expectations of going to university; but a primary source of the latter is likely to be the parents' unusually high expectations, the messages they receive and the discipline in place in relation to schoolwork at home and their relationship with their parents and their parents' norms.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    <str name="description">In 2014, the city of Birmingham (UK) became embroiled in a high-profile scandal that would bring it and the wider education system under disrepute. The 'Trojan Horse' affair, as it become known, began with an anonymised letter that claimed hard-line 'Islamists' were plotting and planning to take over a number of schools in Birmingham. Amongst the allegations were that some of the schools had been promoting gender segregation and that children were not safeguarded against the risks of extremism. This article examines some of those issues in relation to the Trojan Horse scandal and uses a qualitative study focused on participants from the area of Birmingham. As the tribunal hearings against the teachers have now found no wrongdoing, the findings reported in this article suggest that Muslim communities feel unfairly categorised as extremists and that such issues have impacted upon their sense of identity and belonging.</str>

    <str name="description">The number of families who choose to home educate has significantly increased in the last decade. This article explores the experiences of British Muslims who home educate using data from a larger study exploring the views of a diverse range of families. Drawing on the work of Beck, we discuss how 'risk' is understood in relation to Muslim home educators. For these families, decisions to home educate were often made in response to identifying risks associated with their children attending school. At the same time, OFSTED has identified 'risks' of radicalisation associated with the 'Trojan Horse' affair which they linked specifically to Muslim families who home educate. We argue that Muslim families are both marginalised by the perception of 'risk' associated with radicalisation and also by their consequent decisions to home educate.</str>

      <str>Hoque, Aminul</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article examines the lives and multifaceted identities of a group of young Bangladeshis from east London. Qualitative research--involving predominantly group and in-depth one-to-one interviews--was undertaken with 16 young Bangladeshis aged 15-19. Two key findings emerge from this research. Firstly, the knotty and fluid concept of identity is important to these young people as their narratives demonstrate that they are negotiating meanings of what it means to be a British-born Bangladeshi Muslim. Secondly, through a detailed examination of two aspects of their multifaceted identity--the mother tongue and the hijab--this article argues that their identity problematic poses important questions for educational spaces. One of the key conclusions of this article is that by embracing a culturally responsive model of education and exploring--however difficult and ethically challenging it may be--our pupils' cultural, linguistic, ethnic and religious identities within the curriculum can be meaningful and ultimately educational.</str>

    <str name="description">This article draws on an analysis of the narratives of teachers, policy-makers and young Muslim working-class women to explore how schools worked towards producing the model neoliberal middle-class female student. In two urban case-study schools, teaching staff encouraged the girls to actively challenge their culture through discourses grounded in western post-feminist ideals of female 'empowerment.' The production of the compliant 'model Muslim female student' appeared to be a response to the heroic western need to 'save' the young women from backward cultural and religious practices. While this approach had many positive and liberating effects for the young women, it ironically produced forms of post-feminist 'gender friendly' self-regulation. The article concludes with a black feminist intersectional analysis of race, religion, gender, sexuality and class in the context of British multiculturalism and rising Islamophobia, exploring the contradictions of gendered social justice discourses that do not fully embrace 'difference' in educational spaces.</str>

    <str name="description">The last 15 years have seen a remarkable shift in the educational representation of British-born Muslim young men. In the media-led reclassification of them, from South Asian to Muslim, they have moved from ideal student to potential jihadist. This article draws upon a three-year ethnographic study with young Muslim men located within the West Midlands. A shared emphasis on structural issues across critical theoretical frameworks on neoliberalism, government discourses, such as Prevent, and counter narratives on Islamophobia serves to underplay young Muslim men's subjectivity, and in so doing limits their self-authorization. We argue that at a time of intense state/institutional surveillance as a 'suspect community' and the criminalization of ethnic and religious difference, Muslim young men are in the process of negotiating late-modern urban masculine identities. Simultaneously, deploying a methodological reflexivity indicates that a re-reading of their narratives provides insights into recent political changes and national belonging.</str>

    <str name="description">This research contributes to the booming literature on the mobility of international students in higher education. We analyse university-level factors that affect the sorting of Chinese international students across British universities. We produced a unique data-set merging university-level data from the 2014 UK Higher Education Statistics Agency and the Higher Expectations Survey, supplemented by qualitative evidence from six focus groups for illustrative purposes. Our results, using nationally representative evidence for the first time, confirmed that university prestige is the most important driver for the sorting of Chinese students across British universities, together with further effects of the broader social and cultural offerings that the universities provide. Interestingly, the cost of study and marketing strategies deployed by universities do not seem to drive the Chinese students' university choices. Our findings underline the importance of diffuse institutional factors such as university rankings and their taken-for-granted status by students themselves.</str>

    <str name="description">This article proposes an inquiry into Foucault's approach of subjectivation, extending it to the institutional actors and individual subjects in the educational field in the Global South. The article takes Senegal as a case study and examines the reactions of these categories of actors to the Education for All global policy and to the national policies drawn from it. The article focuses on the resistance practices without ignoring the conformity dimension. The theoretical extension proposed is based on the complementary association of Foucault's works on 'resistance' with the theoretical models of Hirschman, of Bajoit and of Le Bourhis and Lascoumes. This enables the development of a typology of forms of reactions to global educational prescriptions, going from a variety of resistance practices to conformity attitudes.</str>

Data are discussed from nine months of classroom observations of nine secondary science classes from six inner London schools (approximately 200 students, aged 11-15), interviews and workshop data from the nine teachers and 13 discussion groups conducted with 59 students. The approach resulted in noticeable changes in practice, which were perceived by teachers and students to improve student engagement, cultivate a range of science-related dispositions and promote wider student participation and 'voice' in classes. Issues, limitations and possibilities for sociology of education are discussed.</str>

    <str name="description">This article centres on the problem of raising the level of school knowledge, particularly science knowledge, for all. The article describes studies in science education developed in Portugal by Morais and Neves and collaborators. These studies are mainly based on Bernstein's model of pedagogic discourse (PD), and on his theorisation on knowledge structures. The concepts of classification (power) and framing (control) are revisited to highlight their potential to characterise educational code modalities, through an extensive external language of description. Examples of instruments are presented in order to discuss the potential of using classification to analyse the status and the conceptual level of school knowledge (the what of PD) and also of using classification and framing to distinguish power and control relations between subjects, discourses and spaces (the how of PD), in educational texts/contexts. Educational code modalities which encourage school success are discussed in terms of their implications for greater equity.</str>

    <str name="description">We examine school choices made by western expatriate parents in post-colonial Hong Kong in order to understand the essence of imagined global citizenship and its implications for existing ethnic and class inequalities in the education system. Responding to changes in the global job market, a small but increasingly visible group of parents are seeking to challenge what they see as the constraints of expatriate life by developing global opportunities for their children through Cantonese language acquisition in the local education system. Drawing on the sociological literature on school choice and middle-class identity, we argue that these parents are negotiating for themselves a global imaginary in which cultures can easily be traversed and social class is levelled. But such global desires, we suggest, can also replicate colonial privilege in a way that marginalises poorer schools and other ethnic minorities in the education system.</str>

    <str name="description">The discrimination of Roma groups across Europe has been highlighted by several international organisations. For many, poverty, racism and their children's systematic exclusion from education are 'push' factors when deciding to migrate. This study explores Roma mothers' views of their children's education post migration and their attitudes to education more broadly, by adopting an intersectional framework and examining issues of difference and belonging as experienced by Roma mothers and their children. While Roma mothers recognised the value of education for social mobility, they remained aware of the limited resources they could draw upon, in the absence of desirable economic and cultural capitals, and as a result of their ethnicity, social class, gender and 'undesirable migrant' status. There was a perceived hopelessness in relation to the chances that Roma children have to overcome their marginalisation through schooling, pointing to the need for dedicated policy interventions when working with Roma families.</str>

    <str name="description">There is substantial research about international postgraduate students but little research about their experiences as parents or their children's experiences. We focus on four postgraduate international students with young children navigating early childhood education and care in New Zealand. A narrative analysis, informed by socio-cultural understandings of learning and post-structuralist understandings of identity, revealed emotional complexities, stress and transformation as parents and children made many transitions. Parents wanted their own culture respected and their host culture decoded. Families experienced tensions around the use of home and host languages as they juggled children's present and future linguistic needs. Supporting international students in their family identity has positive effects for them, their children and their doctoral studies, and hence for universities. Further research about the experiences of international students who are parents and of their children could assist in the formulation of policies to effect such support.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Islam underlines equality between women and men regarding their spiritual and intellectual potential. However, given interpretations of religious texts are often availed to suppress women in most Muslim societies, with serious implications for gender equality in the domestic and the professional spheres. This article draws on data from a study of Muslim women academics from three Malaysian universities to highlight the impact of dominant discourses on these women's professional lives and their perceptions of gender equality, and discusses its implications for their professional journeys. The article argues that the feudal patriarchal structures of most Muslim societies, reinforced by vested interpretations of religious texts, validate a powerful discourse of male authority which contributes to the perception that submitting to male authority is a Muslim woman's religious obligation. The seductive power of these discourses couched in religious authority influences the terms of their professional engagement and their conceptualisations and understanding of gender equality.</str>

    <str name="description">This article reviews three books: (1) &amp;quot;Elite Education: International Perspectives&amp;quot; (edited by C. Maxwell and P. Aggleton); (2) &amp;quot;Class Choreographies: Elite Schools and Globalisation&amp;quot; (J. Kenway, J. Fahey, D. Epstein, A. Koh, C. McCarthy, and F. Rizvi); and (3) &amp;quot;Corporate Elite and the Reform of Public Education&amp;quot; (edited by H.M. Gunter, D. Hall, and M.W. Apple). These three books, published within a few years of each other, are all aiming to expose aspects of the relationship between elites and schooling. They offer, in different but complementary ways, very valuable contributions to contemporary debates on (elite) schooling and on the role education plays in social reproduction. They point to competing processes inflicting elite schools today--an imperative to become 'global' on the one hand (which includes neoliberalisation and changing financial pressures and imperatives) and yet a need to remain insular, exclusive and isolated from the wider world.</str>

    <str name="description">This article aims to analyse Polish history teachers' understanding of the role of teaching history. Drawing on the results of qualitative research conducted in Wroclaw, we argue that teachers see history education through the prism of nationalism. Teachers construct the past in equivocally nationalist terms. They regard nationalist representations of the past as taken for granted. Moreover, teachers reproduce a dominant nationalist discourse by using history to promote the idea of the homogeneous nation. We argue that teachers see their role primarily in terms of imposing the dominant structures of collective memory on the pupils. We also discuss the differences between teachers pertaining to the understanding of the concept of the nation, the way of teaching Polish history and the type of obligation towards the nation. We also demonstrate that teachers do not see a contradiction between history defined as an objective science and history understood as a &amp;quot;nationalising&amp;quot; tool.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Whilst there has been increasing focus on the impact of neoliberal education policy on the curriculum covered in schools, as well as on teacher and student subjectivities, less research has been done on the possibility, or otherwise, for teachers to challenge curriculum constraints. Arguing that these curriculum constraints are not simply imposed by an external censor, this article takes up Judith Butler's concept of the &amp;quot;domain of the sayable&amp;quot; to theorise what it is possible to imagine teaching in the primary school classroom in the first place. I draw on two different ethnographic data episodes to explore the parameters of the domain of the sayable in the space of the classroom in which I taught, mapping the silences and sudden swerving away from topics that seem to be straying close to what is impossible to say or hear. This process offers new insight into how we might conceptualise teacher resistance and counter politics within the current educational policy milieu in the United Kingdom.</str>

    <str name="description">Drawing on Bourdieu's theory and using Durkheim's concepts of &amp;quot;social fact&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;regulation&amp;quot;, this article examines the place held by public universities within the French higher education (HE) system, breaking with the purely bureaucratic vision prevailing in France today. By setting aside some of the main received ideas about the effects and meanings of student selection and drop-out, the article suggests that public universities play an essential role in regulating the successive flows of first-generation students through French HE. It is precisely because public universities are non-selective that they are able to play this role. Finally, the distribution of HE choices and students' dropping out are both considered as products of a structural and institutional process of regulation.

    <str name="description">Research on school bullying has its roots in the field of developmental and educational psychology, and appeals to the need for a theoretical and methodological widening in order to grasp its ambiguity and complexity. The article draws on ethnographic fieldwork in which 144 pupils and seven teachers participated from seven school classes in three Swedish public primary schools. A constructivist grounded theory guided data gathering and analysis. This article offers an interpretative portrayal of school bullying. It paints a picture of the core process of misfitting and how this process involves the selective use of normativities from the macro, meso and micro levels. When bullying is conceptualized as simply caused by individual characteristics, teachers and others become blind to gender norms, heteronormativity, racism and a range of other oppressions taking place in bullying, and this will fail to offer an appropriate knowledge base on how to counteract and reduce bullying.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article draws on the case of academic work produced by Colombian scholars, to address the debate on the persistent failure of policy efforts to improve school effectiveness. Realist meta-theory plays a significant role in this research, because it provides a general framework to identify ontological problems and inconsistencies in empirical and theoretical positions informing policy debates in the country. The analysis focuses on the contributions and weaknesses of empiricism, structuralism and post-structuralism in the work of Colombian scholars, and concludes by arguing for the need to deploy research methodologies that study stratified emergent social processes behind observable educational outcomes.</str>

    <str name="title">Little Room for Capacitation: Rethinking Bourdieu on Pedagogy as Symbolic Violence</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Watkins, Megan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In Bourdieu's early work on education, he declares that &amp;quot;All pedagogic action (PA) is objectively symbolic violence insofar as it is the imposition of a cultural arbitrary by an arbitrary power&amp;quot;. This article rethinks Bourdieu's proposition. It questions whether all PA is symbolic violence and the very notion of a cultural arbitrary upon which this view is based. For Bourdieu, culture is framed narrowly in terms of class, and pedagogy a mechanism by which it is reproduced. As such, it functions as a form of violence having much in common with Foucault's notion of discipline. Unlike Foucault, however, who also acknowledges the enabling potential of power as a technology of the self, Bourdieu has no such equivalent. His concept of PA leaves little room for capacitation wherein, rather than a cultural arbitrary, certain skills can be seen to have an inherent use value equipping individuals with capacities that are a means for social transformation.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">The professionalisation of teaching in Australia is a policy shift that transpires within broader policy dynamics which are increasingly influenced by neoliberal logics. In this article we examine teacher responsibility through analysis of a new measure introduced in Victoria. This requires teachers to prove professional development hours in the area of teaching students with special needs in order to maintain their professional registration. Through our analysis of this policy move we draw out some tensions that emerge in relation to teacher responsibility, accountability and autonomy to reveal that (often hidden) neoliberal governing logics can operate to shift teachers' focus from care of the student towards care of the (professional) self. With the theoretical support of Nel Noddings' &amp;quot;ethic of care&amp;quot;, we argue that teacher responsibility to care can be torn between market-based regulations and the care of the student, paradoxically de-professionalising teachers' work in the act of attempting to professionalise.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Buddel, Neil Anthony</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The notion that the stories of our lives shape dispositions towards imagined futures is another lens through which university underrepresentation should be viewed. A storied lens attends to how futures, like university attendance, are storied during childhood to the extent that some youth imagine, and therefore plan, these futures as natural progression. Such was the case for study participants, indicating that childhood stories contain answers for mitigating social reproduction connected to parental education and cultural forces within the home. Examining social mobility through the underexplored storied-futures grand narrative presents unique solutions that lay hidden within the dominant meritocratic grand narrative.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Glackin, Melissa</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Drawing on qualitative data, this article presents an analysis of six secondary science teachers' expectations and practices related to teaching outdoors during a professional development programme. Using Foucault's and Bernstein's theories of &amp;quot;space&amp;quot;, routines and set practices, I argue that participant teachers' fear of losing control of their students when in contexts outside the classroom was constructed as place specific in terms of boundaries (or lack of), familiarity and disturbance. Teachers' &amp;quot;fearful&amp;quot; expectations when outside triggered the initial use of regulatory technologies that were frequently more assertive and controlling than their usual classroom practice, resulting in increased authoritative teaching approaches. However, once technologies of power were developed for use outside, teachers were able to translate and apply their normal dialogic teaching approaches from the classroom. The article concludes with a discussion of student self-regulation through collaborative group work as a step towards resolving the tensions between dialogic pedagogy and teaching in new contexts.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines the school choices of families who have recently experienced downward mobility during the economic crisis in Spain. Based on semi-structured interviews we analyse the educational strategies of the families in a Bourdieusian framework, focusing on how they cope with the loss of their perceived social status. Prior to the crisis, these families of working-class origin improved their social position as a result of their success in economic capital accumulation with a humble increase in social and cultural capital. Our research suggests that the concerns of families confronted with downward social mobility are manifested in tensions related to their school choice in terms of their strategies of resistance and negotiation with regards to the ownership, social composition and corresponding perceived quality of the school. School can symbolically represent the last resort, an indispensable investment in one's own future and that of the next generation.</str>

    <str name="title">Cultural Capital as Whiteness? Examining Logics of Ethno-Racial Representation and Resistance</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Wallace, Derron</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">There is a significant, longstanding tradition in British sociological research that renders cultural capital synonymous with whiteness. This article suggests that one substantive factor that contributes to the enduring relationship between whiteness and cultural capital is the paucity of research on the Black and ethnic minority middle classes. Studies of social class in the United Kingdom frequently render middle-class life synonymous with whiteness and all too often fix ethno-racial identities to the working classes. The article draws on a 14-month comparative ethnography as a case study to provide an asset-based reading of cultural capital among the Black Caribbean middle classes in Britain. The findings suggest that the seemingly exclusive link between whiteness and cultural capital is problematised by Black Caribbean young people, and therefore should be further critiqued in sociological and educational research, especially when developing cultural capital analyses.</str>

    <str name="title">The Hybrid Professional: An Examination of How Educational Leaders Relate to, with and through Managerialism</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Machin, Denry</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines how one particular class of educational leader--international school Heads--relate to managerialism. Representing a novel site of new theorisation, the independence enjoyed by these leaders allows a 'purer' view of managerialism as experienced 'in here' (inside the subject), not just as a reaction to what is 'out there' (i.e. to policy). Through analysis of twenty-five face-to-face interviews, they were found to have relationships to managerialism that are not compliant or transgressive, educational or managerial, but hybridic. Some Heads relate to managerialism pragmatically; they reluctantly 'do' managerialism but avoid, segment and/or moderate managerial influences on their identities. Other Heads proactively use managerialism to discipline their staff and organisations; they draw power from managerial discourses; and they claim its values as their own. Seen through the lens of hybridity, educational identifications remain important, indeed they remain paramount, but for some subjects, they have been conjoined with complimentary managerial ones.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article considers moral agendas projected onto parents that mobilise them to supplement school literacy education with private tutoring. The theoretical frame draws on the concepts of responsibilisation as emerging market-embedded morality, 'nudge' social policies, edu-business and hidden privatisation in education. This framing is applied to two empirical moments: firstly, debates around the Australian government's 'Tutorial Voucher Initiative' of 2004; and secondly, tutoring advertisements and items in school newsletters collected in early 2016. In the first moment, parents were somewhat reluctant to take up free supplementary tutoring; in the second, private literacy tutoring is increasingly normalised and legitimated as parents are nudged to supplement the work of the school.</str>

    <str name="description">Researchers have begun to explore the role that faith schools play in contemporary educational markets but the emphasis to date has been on urban rather than rural contexts. This article approaches the issue of marketisation through a qualitative case-study comparison of two Anglican primary schools in contrasting rural localities in England and Wales. Engaging with a range of stakeholders, including parents and pupils, the article explores reasons why the schools were valued, drawing on wider constructions of childhood, religion and rurality. The consequences of the schools' popularity on factors such as traffic, parking, school ethos and local community ties are also considered. The findings of the study problematise some of the prevalent assumptions about marketisation, including the role of social class and geography in these processes. As such, the article makes an important contribution to the sociological literature on faith schools, rural schools and educational markets.</str>

    <str name="description">The competitive university has brought about changes in structural conditions and created contradictions which are embedded in institutions. The present study is based on interviews with 42 early career researchers in the field of education sciences in Sweden. We analyse how members of this group handle career possibilities and limitations in relation to gender and to the structural ambivalence embedded in the higher education system. Our results illustrate that the structure of education sciences contains power relations and processes of differentiation, which give researchers different access to resources that can be used to handle structural ambivalence. This is illustrated in how, for example, women researchers, more than men, lack resources to solve the experienced tensions surrounding them, and therefore often work in areas where they are able to cope. Men researchers can often solve their career ambivalence by avoiding traps and gaining recognition, and are therefore able to advance.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Friedman, Jonathan Z.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Cosmopolitanism has been cast by some in recent years as a form of cultural capital, disproportionately available to students on elite educational pathways. This article tests this supposition, by comparing the enactment of global citizenship education reforms at two high-status and two low-status universities in the United Kingdom. These enactments have indeed differed, as some students are being encouraged to cultivate a sophisticated cosmopolitan disposition for positions of leadership, while other students are not--even if they are being encouraged to learn more about the world, or to develop social tolerance. Comparing the practices and meanings attributed to the global citizenship agenda among universities in different positions in the higher education field, this article illuminates dynamics related to the creation, legitimation, and differentiation of cosmopolitan capital among different groups of students. The article also extends understanding of how the institutional hierarchy of higher education provision positions students for the global economy unequally.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Raaper, Rille</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Guided by a Foucauldian theorisation, this article explores Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) experiences of their work and subjectivity in a neoliberalised higher education environment. By drawing on a research project with GTAs from one UK university, the article argues that GTA work is increasingly shaped by neoliberal reforms. The GTAs interviewed are critical of internationalisation, marketisation and client culture, and see these processes as acting on their subjectivity. The GTAs position themselves as mediators between demanding students and overworked academics: they have turned into much-needed 'peacekeepers' and 'machine factories'. The findings also demonstrate that the subjectivity enforced by a dominant market ideology is further negotiated in the GTA experience. The discourses reveal that a lack of institutional control and coordination of graduate teaching provides the means for, and indeed enables, the GTAs to express some, but often limited, discontent with neoliberalism.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Cultural reproduction is rarely, if ever, theorised through clandestine practices of sexual offending by teachers in the gendered hierarchies of state schools. Drawing upon Freedom of Information requests and other official qualitative data provided by a U.K. teaching council, this article endeavours to explain the form of a gendered cultural reproduction by reference to the diversity of ways in which identities are constructed and 'contracted' for female student victims. The article begins by looking at this taboo subject matter in the context of a historical patriarchal order and cultures of heterosexuality in schools, followed by a feminist perspective through which empirical theorisation is documented. Michel Foucault's work on the micro-physics of power and normativity informs the emphasis of the contemporary feminist prism. It is argued that this offending occurs under the auspices of the professional teacher-student hierarchy and produces distinctive and damaging power effects.</str>

      <str>Schuller, Karin</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The present article analyzes the development of the ethnic gap--with respect to the attainment of vocational degrees--over the immigration cohorts 1960-2001 by examining how social integration indicators and general secondary school education may help to explain the trend. It was found that the gap between natives and migrants increased. Above all, the large increase in the gap over cohorts between Germans and Turks is alarming. In contrast to that the gap and its increase between the group of immigrants from Central-/Eastern-/Southeastern European countries as well as from other former recruitment countries and German natives is comparably small and can to a large extent be explained by a growing gap regarding the level of general secondary education among the newer immigration cohorts and native Germans due to educational expansion and to a growing impact of the secondary school education for the achievement of vocational education. The effect of social integration plays a smaller role compared to general secondary school education and it even decreases over immigration cohorts.</str>

    <str name="description">Despite being a protracted refugee crisis that entails international debates and controversies, discussions about Palestinian education have frequently sidelined the perspectives, needs and priorities of the Palestinian refugee population. Drawing upon a qualitative study in the West Bank and engaging with theoretical ideas of Johan Galtung, Paulo Freire and Pierre Bourdieu, we argue that the nexus between educational motivation and motivation for Palestinian liberation, which was particularly significant during the periods of 'Palestinian uprising', seems to be declining today in the present day context of oppression and structural violence. The growing disassociation among young refugees with Palestinian liberation, and with education as a means to this liberation, can be seen as a process of symbolic violence. Building upon these findings, we propose a new analytical framework for understanding the interrelationship between education, violence and struggle for social and political transformation in conflict-affected societies.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores the changes in intergenerational mobility seen in Spain during the last century. It examines educational and occupational mobility, paying particular attention to the existence of a differentiated gender effect. The magnitude of the historical changes that have taken place in Spain during the twentieth century and the scarcity of studies in this field increase the value of this paper. More specifically, the paper seeks to describe how the situation has changed with the social-economic and education policy developments in democratic Spain, especially with regards to women. The main results show that while educational mobility has improved, there has been no such significant change in occupational mobility.</str>

    <str name="description">This article argues that there is a double problem in international research in cultural capital and educational attainment: an empirical problem, since few new insights have been gained within recent years; and a theoretical problem, since cultural capital is seen as a simple hypothesis about certain isolated individual resources, disregarding the structural vision and important related concepts such as field in Bourdieu's sociology. We (re-)emphasize the role of field theory in cultural capital research in education, taking into consideration current concerns in international quantitative research.</str>

    <str name="description">Research on the socially-situated nature of learning shows how practices and identities are affected by participation in communities, but very little is known about how mature-age students experience the relational dynamics of university. Based on data from a qualitative study of first-year students, we consider written accounts by older learners to examine how they negotiate the culture of higher education. We found that mature-age students encounter a university culture dominated by younger students, who draw separating boundaries between the social and the academic and stigmatise older students because of their academic practices. Drawing on Lave and Wenger's learning theory, we examine the way mature-age students negotiate the process of becoming legitimate members of the learning community, and the resistance they face in doing so. Knowing how mature-age students learn, and how to support them, depends on examining their negotiation of university culture, as well as their differing aspirations and needs.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Falabella, Alejandra</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Using qualitative data from two Chilean public schools, I interrogate the expectation that standardised testing motivates staff to critically self-assess themselves and to be accountable for failing evaluations. The research findings bring new insights into looking at ways in which school members, especially head managers, strategically debate, highlight and obscure scores, classifications and ranking positions to generate narratives of institutional success, while defending themselves from negative outcomes. Members are both disciplined by state technologies, but are also actively committed to produce school identity narratives in creative ways as a manner to make sense of the school and maintain its value.</str>

    <str name="title">White Working-Class Male Narratives of &amp;quot;Loyalty to Self&amp;quot; in Discourses of Aspiration</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Stahl, Garth</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper intends to show the processes and identity negotiations of white working-class boys surrounding their own learner-identity within a &amp;quot;raising aspirations&amp;quot; rhetoric. The current dominant neoliberal discourse, which prioritizes a view of aspiration that is competitive, economic, and status-based, shapes the subjectivities of these young males. Focusing on the deeply engrained values of a group of 23 working-class boys from South London, ages 14-16, this research critically considers the conception of aspiration and persistent &amp;quot;educational underachievement&amp;quot;. White working-class boys in the United Kingdom are frequently labelled as having &amp;quot;low aspirations&amp;quot; or, indeed, no aspirations at all. Through the use of habitus as a conceptual tool, the research intends to serve as an exploration of how the aspiration rhetoric influenced the boys' conception of &amp;quot;loyalty to self&amp;quot; and their sense of average-ness/ordinariness/&amp;quot;middling&amp;quot;. The boys' habitus undergoes complex &amp;quot;identity work&amp;quot; in order to reconcile competing and contrasting conceptions of aspiration.</str>

    <str name="description">In Italy, as in other European countries, students of foreign origin are over-represented in the vocational school tracks, with relevant consequences on their limited chances of attaining a university degree. While research has long underlined the weight that a family's social, cultural and economic capital has on a child's school performance, educational expectations and choices, the role that school and teachers themselves play in the transition from lower to upper secondary school has been rarely explored in Italian sociological research. The present study aims to bridge this gap in the literature, showing how teachers' orienting practices, interacting with highly differentiated patterns of family participation in the school guidance process, can play a relevant role in reproducing foreign-origin students' segregation into the lower tracks of the school system.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Since the Human Genome Project mapped the gene sequence, new biological sciences have been generating a raft of new knowledges about the mechanisms and functions of the molecular body. One area of work that has particular potential to speak to sociology of education, is the emerging field of epigenetics. Epigenetics moves away from the mapped genome and the search for causes of disease and difference in candidate genes and gene variations across the genome, and towards understanding how environmental factors bring about molecular changes that regulate genes and impact their expression. Put simply, epigenetics is exploring how the environment influences what genes do. There has been very limited direct engagement to date with epigenetics by the field of education. In this article, the author discusses a selection of texts that she believes are highly relevant to the field of education, and to sociology of education in particular, but which are more or less removed from the field. These are David Moore's &amp;quot;The Developing Genome,&amp;quot; which is a particularly helpful epigenetics primer that will be useful to anyone wanting to obtain a science-eye view of the field; Maurizio Meloni's &amp;quot;Political Biology,&amp;quot; which offers a compelling treatment of epigenetics as unavoidably political; Celia Roberts' &amp;quot;Puberty in Crisis,&amp;quot; which demonstrates how a 'bio-psycho-social' reading challenges established policy, public and feminist thinking about early sexual development; and Samantha Frost's &amp;quot;Biocultural Creatures,&amp;quot; which is a feminist posthumanist account of the human that demonstrates the inseparability of the biological and the cultural. Together, these texts begin to suggest what is required for and what might be achieved through biosocial approaches in education.</str>

      <str>Ball, Stephen J.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper extends the author's previous enquiries and discussions of governmentality and neoliberal policy technologies in a number of ways. The paper explores the specificity and generality of performativity as a particular contemporary mode of power relations. It addresses our own imbrication in the politics of performative truths, through our ordinary everyday life and work. The paper is about the here and now, us, you and me, and who we are in neoliberal education. It draws upon and considers a set of ongoing email exchanges with a small group of teachers who are struggling with performativity. It enters the &amp;quot;theoretical silence&amp;quot; of governmentality studies around the issues of resistance and contestation. Above all, the paper attempts to articulate the risks of refusal through Foucault's notion of fearless speech or truth-telling (parrhesia).</str>

    <str name="description">This paper contributes to a growing body of literature on widening university participation and brings a focus on the classed and embodied nature of young people's imagination to existing discussions. We interviewed 250 young people living in disadvantaged communities across five Australian states who had experienced disengagement from compulsory primary and secondary schooling. We asked them about their education and their educational futures, specifically how they imagined universities and university participation. For these young people, universities were imagined as &amp;quot;big&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;massive&amp;quot; alienating schools. The paper explores how the elements of schooling from which these young people disengaged became tangible barriers to imagining and pursuing participation in university education. The primary barrier they described was their relationships with school teachers. Our analysis shows how relationships with teachers can impact the imagined improbability/probability of university participation. We offer suggestions for how barriers to university created by poor relationships with teachers may be overcome.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper analyses tuitional practices after a major curriculum change (2005) in primary schools of Turkey. Group discussions conducted with teachers and parents in five maximally contrasting schools (e.g. schools in a squatter and a middle-class neighbourhood of Istanbul) show that tuitional practices, being only &amp;quot;loosely coupled&amp;quot; with the official curriculum, are strongly influenced by generation-specific orientations in teachers' organisational milieus, by orientations prevalent in the social milieus of pupils and their parents, and by different forms of capital on the part of teachers, parents and school organisations. Combined with empirical analysis, the paper proposes a theoretical framework that complements the assumptions of New Institutionalism by using the basic concepts of the sociology of knowledge and Bourdieu's concept of capital. This framework offers a new way to understand the intrinsic logic of the growing differences and inequalities within and between school organisations in complex societies.</str>

    <str name="description">Drawing on Bernstein's notion of pedagogic culture or the &amp;quot;mode of being&amp;quot; of the school, this paper develops and uses a theoretical framework for the analysis of school organization that draws attention to specialization of instructional practice. An understanding of the ordering principles of the school emerges from the analysis, fundamentally understood as relations of power and control in the school as an organization. The paper considers how the ordering principles of the school are related to differential performance. The framework is deployed in an analysis of six primary schools located in poor communities in South Africa.</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores the economic relationships between individual students' unions and their wider institutions, and the ways in which they articulate with a pervasive consumerist agenda across the higher education sector. We draw on data from a UK-wide study to argue that students' unions have an ambivalent relationship with consumerist discourses: on the one hand, they often reject the premise that the higher education student is best conceptualised as a consumer; yet, on the other, they frequently accept aspects of consumerism as a means of, for example, trying to protect their independence and autonomy. We explore whether this particular form of positioning with respect to consumerism is best conceptualised as a form of resistance, or whether it has become extremely difficult for students' unions to take up any other position in a system that is driven by market logic.</str>

    <str name="description">Established literature suggests that language problems lead to lower attainment levels in those subjects that are more language dependent. Also, language has been suggested as a main driver of ethnic minority attainment. We use an original dataset of 2,020 secondary school students to show that ethnic minority students in Cyprus underperform overall, but they do not perform less well in subjects considered more language dependent. We suggest that the main determinant for their low performance is not linguistic but cultural. This is the first study to investigate the performance of Georgians as an ethnic minority group in a European country. It is also one of the very few studies which were deliberately designed to compare the attainment of ethnic minority students on more and less language-dependent subjects. Methodologically, this is an instructive study using a repeated-measures design and combining teacher assessments with test results to alleviate floor and ceiling effects.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper draws on actor-network theory and on the sociology of cultural consumption to examine the phenomenon of corporate Massive Open Online Courses. Through an analysis of texts available in the public domain, the paper argues that over a short period (between 2012 and 2013) digitisation technology became associated with the emergence of a hybrid &amp;quot;actor&amp;quot;: the digital video-recorder teacher. A parallel is drawn between the &amp;quot;interactive affordances&amp;quot; of digital instruction and the playback and cataloguing options that have contributed to shifts in television viewing habits. The digital video-recorder teacher is described as an artefact in the service of a postmodern project of self-improvement through cultural consumption, which recruits digitisation to meet a growing demand for &amp;quot;upgrades to the self&amp;quot;. In the conclusion, the paper explores how the study of digital education could benefit from an interface between sociomaterial studies and the sociology of culture.</str>

    <str name="title">Music on the Move: Methodological Applications of Bernstein's Concepts in a Secondary School Music Context</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>McPhail, Graham J.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In 2002 Parlo Singh outlined Bernstein's theory of the pedagogic device, elaborating the potential in Bernstein's complex theoretical framework for empirical research. In particular, Singh suggests that Bernstein's concepts provide the means of making explicit the macro and micro structuring of knowledge into pedagogic communication. More recently, Power has noted that use of Bernstein's ideas remains relatively unrepresented in the literature. This paper makes a case for the use of Bernstein's ideas as a particularly rich resource for educational researchers. It provides illustrations of a number of concepts as part of a methodological procedure in a research project examining the approaches to curriculum and pedagogy of six secondary school music teachers within the dialectic of western art music and popular music. Through utilisation of Bernstein's concepts of knowledge discourses, recontextualisation, and regionalisation, the study is able to identify, describe, and shed light on a key problem for music education and education generally: developing the pedagogical means for the utilisation of informal knowledge as a pedagogic resource within the secondary school curriculum. In turn, the music context suggests a number of extensions to Bernstein's concepts.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Tran, Ly Thi</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper unpacks the meanings and implications of the mobility of international students in vocational education--an under-researched group in the field of international education. This four-year study found that transnational mobility is regarded as a resourceful vehicle to help international students &amp;quot;become&amp;quot; the kind of person they want to be. The paper justifies the value of re-conceptualising student mobility as a process of &amp;quot;becoming&amp;quot;. Mobility as &amp;quot;becoming&amp;quot; encompasses students' aspirations for educational, social, personal and professional development. Theorising mobility as &amp;quot;becoming&amp;quot; captures international students' lived realities and has the potential to facilitate the re-imagining of international student mobility with new outlooks. By theorising mobility as &amp;quot;becoming&amp;quot;, this research suggests the importance of drawing on the integrated and transformative nature of Bourdieu's forms of capital in understanding the logics and practice of the social field--international student mobility.</str>

    <str name="description">Using PISA 2009 data for Croatia, this paper addresses the relationship between socio-economic background, cultural capital and educational attainment. Following Bourdieu, we emphasized the importance of interpreting cultural capital effects as effects of family habitus. The results indicated that the material and the relational dimension of cultural capital had independent effects on science literacy results. Although there was no significant interaction effect between socio-economic status and cultural capital, the analysis suggested both a tendency for social reproduction as well as the possibility for social mobility of students with lower socio-economic status.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper investigates the role of ethnic majority staff in the perpetuation of monocultural education that excludes non-western, ethnic minority cultures and reproduces institutional racism in schools. Based on qualitative data collected through semi-structured interviews in four ethnically diverse schools in the Flemish educational system, we specifically investigate the role of ethnic majority staff in the reproduction of monocultural school practices through a discursive theoretical lens. The study advances the current literature on institutional racism by showing how situated meanings of monocultural school practices at the micro level of individuals are discursively inter-linked with the macro-level monocultural model of education.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">In recent years the proliferation, speed and reach of school-based surveillance devices has undergone what could be labelled as a revolution. Drawing upon Foucault's concept of biopower to explore the disciplining of bodies and the biopolitical management of populations, this paper examines &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; school surveillance technologies enabling biometric measurement, electronic detection, substance screening, video observation and data monitoring. Klein's notion of surveillance 2.0 is utilised to further examine emerging features of school monitoring practices, including the impact of &amp;quot;data doubles,&amp;quot; playful student resistance and the commodification of surveillance. It is concluded that invasive school surveillance practices are becoming normalised, that politically motivated, data-driven simulations could increasingly be used to support education interventions and that a function creep is occurring as recreational devices become embroiled in institutional surveillance practices.</str>

    <str name="description">This study examines the differential patterns of school success of rural students as a result of China's market transition. The process dimension, how families from different social backgrounds within rural society get involved in rural schooling and how this contributes to the inequality of school success within rural society, is investigated. The data analysis suggests that schools as institutions provide few official channels for rural parents to participate in rural schools and help their children to achieve school success. This raises the importance of families' strategic initiatives to employ &amp;quot;guanxi&amp;quot; within family, community and between school and family. These make the point that &amp;quot;guanxi&amp;quot; and their employment have become an important mechanism for social inclusion and exclusion in the competition for advantages in school success in post-socialist China.</str>

    <str name="description">A growing body of literature has begun to explore the individual identities, motivations, and school choices of middle-class, typically white, parents who choose to reside in socioeconomically and racially mixed central city neighborhoods. Drawing on qualitative research in three US cities, we argue that a focus on middle-class parents' collective engagement in schooling is particularly important in under-resourced urban contexts. In these environments, we show, middle-class parents' use of social networks often extends beyond basic information-sharing about school quality to encompass a range of activities undertaken with other families &amp;quot;like them&amp;quot; who have also chosen to enroll their children in an urban public school. We find that, in some instances, middle-class parents' collective actions can benefit an entire class or school. Yet in other instances, their activation of social capital can contribute to processes of social reproduction in urban schooling by excluding or marginalizing low-income students and their families.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Smith, Emma</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines the role that social characteristics play in determining the academic success of students who begin university with roughly similar entry grades. The data used were drawn from the administrative records of over 38,000 UK-domiciled undergraduate students from one British university between 1998 and 2009. Results show that the characteristics of entrants have varied only slightly over this period and intake is still largely in favour of &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; entrants: namely those from professional occupational backgrounds, the privately educated and those of traditional age. The relationship between background characteristics and eventual academic success also reflects patterns seen at earlier education stages. However, when prior attainment was taken into account, the link between degree outcome and many social characteristics does diminish -- notably for students who were privately educated and who came from professional occupational groups. This suggests that once students have overcome barriers to admission, it is entry grades rather than social characteristics that may most strongly influence eventual academic success.</str>

      <str>Carolan, Brian V.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Building from the classic Wisconsin model of status attainment, this study examines whether a specific style of parenting, concerted cultivation, and a close friend's school-related attitudes and behaviors mediate the relationship between a family's socioeconomic status and their child's academic achievement in the United States. Using a recursive path model on nationally representative panel data of high school students (N = 10,350), the results confirm a direct association between socioeconomic status and concerted cultivation. In addition, concerted cultivation and close friends are shown to mediate the relationship between a family's socioeconomic status and their child's academic achievement.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">The field of academia is frequently associated with traditional norms that aim to regulate scholarly activity, especially research. The social web, as another field, is often viewed as challenging long-established conventions with novel knowledge production practices. Hence, the two fields seem to oppose rather than complement each other. Using a Bourdieuian lens, this research examines research participants' accounts of their approaches to practice on the social web in relation to academia. The paper reports on the habitus dissonance between the two fields, before discussing the effects of the two fields' competing doxas on individuals' habitus.</str>

    <str name="description">Based on Bourdieu's conceptualization of social capital (the social stratification perspective), this study examines the impact of social capital on the educational outcomes of young people in Sweden, with a focus on the extra-familial aspect of social capital -- that is, social capital generated by parental networks and active membership in various social organizations and friendship networks. The results indicate that the class background of respondents is the main predictor of access to all three forms of extra-familial social capital. However, after controlling for class background, the children of racialized immigrant groups are more likely to have access to more types of social capital than others. All three aspects of extra-familial social capital positively influence the educational performance of pupils.</str>

    <str name="description">In this paper I examine the &amp;quot;pedagogies of positioning&amp;quot; performatively played out within the Australian high school classrooms I observed. The study aimed to develop a better understanding of how teachers pedagogically racialise the classroom in and through discursive encounters with students. The social analysis of these data accepts that teachers and students (and the researcher) performatively do race in ways that locate, construct, and negotiate racialised identities and relationships. A collection of &amp;quot;chronicles&amp;quot; are presented that help reveal the &amp;quot;everyday&amp;quot; discursive practices of both teachers and students that continue to rely on racially stereotypical social scripts that sustain discriminatory racialised hierarchies. The article aims to (re)emphasise why the classroom remains a valuable location to interrupt the reiterative power of Whiteness, in addition to gesturing to potential ways forward with opening up alternative &amp;quot;lines of flight&amp;quot; for young learners.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines the importance of &amp;quot;self-determination&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hard work&amp;quot; found within interviews with a group of young people in Manchester, England. The author suggests that moments of apparent contradiction within the interviews have much to offer, particularly when analysed in relation to discussions of inequality and political economy. Data from this paper show that while the young people mostly spoke about work choices in primarily individualistic ways, they used the recession as a means to acknowledge that acquiring jobs simply cannot just be about &amp;quot;choice&amp;quot; or working hard, but is also configured by the market and structural inequality.</str>

    <str name="description">In Britain, educational qualifications gained at school continue to play an important and central role in young people's educational and employment pathways. Recently there has been growing interest in documenting the lives of &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; young people. In this paper we analyse the Youth Cohort Study of England and Wales in order to better document the experiences of those with &amp;quot;middle&amp;quot; levels of school General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) attainment. The overall pattern of school GCSE attainment is one of increasing levels of performance. GCSE attainment is still highly stratified. Girls performed better than boys, and there were some marked differences in attainment for pupils from the main minority ethnic groups. Most notably, parental socio-economic positions are the most important factor. The analyses fail to persuade us that there are clear boundaries that demark a &amp;quot;middle&amp;quot; category of school GCSE attainment. We conclude that sociologists should study &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; young people; however, school GCSE attainment is best understood as a continuum, and measures such as the number of GCSEs or point scores are preferable.</str>

    <str name="description">The rapid pace of urbanisation in China has seen a massive increase in the movement of the rural population to work and live in urban regions. In this large-scale migration context, the educational, health, and psychological problems of floating children are becoming increasingly visible. Different from extant studies, we focus our investigation on the rural dispositions of floating children through interviews with leaders, teachers, and students in four schools in Beijing. Drawing on Bourdieu's key notions of habitus, capital, and field, our study indicates that the rural habitus of floating children can differentiate these children from their urban peers. This habitus can be marginalised and stigmatised in certain fields but can be recognised and valued as capital in other fields. Our paper offers some implications for research and practice in relation to the schooling of floating children.</str>

    <str name="description">The impact of participation in adult literacy programmes on learners' identities is examined through an interrogation of their past and current experiences and the assessment of the effect of particular pedagogies. The findings show how learners' positive experiences in their programmes had caused them to re-evaluate their previous understandings and enabled the construction of new identities as people that are able to learn. These changes had come about through the challenging of negative discourses, the creation of new figured worlds and imagined futures, and the use of a learning curriculum where learners' experiences were utilized as positive resources.</str>

    <str name="description">This article is concerned with teachers' negotiation of global transitions premised on improving educational opportunity with implications for professionalism. The study blends sociology of gender, work, and organisations and gender policy analysis to theorise teachers' policy negotiations. I explore how 20 Argentine teachers mediate 3 programmes' demands for care work. Policy as practice and street-level bureaucracy are applied to data to interrogate for gendered boundary work. I propose the addition of care work, gender, and a street-level view to Maguire's global teacher.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines the experiences of children learning to read in a multi-ethnic London primary school. The data are drawn from doctoral research, based on ethnographic fieldwork, with children aged six to seven years and ten to eleven years. Reading is revealed as a strongly emotional realm for children. The children are weak to resist teacher assessment of themselves, but nonetheless seek to create consoling narratives against what they perceive to be the negative identity of &amp;quot;poor reader.&amp;quot; The data are distinctive, as resistance to school hierarchies and strong feelings about educational failure are manifested in the narratives of children as young as six years old.</str>

    <str name="description">Despite 50 years and more of &amp;quot;progressive education&amp;quot; in the United Kingdom, classed patterns of educational success and failure stubbornly prevail. So how, where and when does it all go wrong for the many children who continue to fail or underachieve? Drawing on the work of Basil Bernstein, this article centres processes within early years education which are claimed to help launch children into careers as either educational successes or failures. Our data suggest that children more or less happily play their lives away in the progressive play pedagogies of early years education, in the process learning their position in social and ability hierarchies that help define their future careers inside and outside schools. That such hierarchies prevail is the fault of neither teachers nor parents. Indeed, it is what early years education settings are legitimised to do: sieve and sort, and make children &amp;quot;school ready,&amp;quot; pliant and prepared for a lifetime of learning to succeed or fail.</str>

    <str name="description">Using the 2000 and 2009 waves of Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) data, we examined the relationships between family socio-economic status (SES), cultural capital, and reading achievement among students in five post-socialist Eastern European countries while comparing the findings with three Western bench-marking countries. Findings: In all studied countries, higher-SES students possessed higher levels of cultural capital and exhibited higher reading achievement. Cultural capital was uniformly positively associated with reading achievement. We found the least stratification by SES in Russia both in the distribution of cultural capital and reading achievement. The findings provide no evidence of the overall decline of the importance of cultural capital over time; most of the associations between cultural capital measures and reading achievement remained stable across the waves. Between-country variation in the findings does not indicate East-West divide (with the exception of Russia).</str>

    <str name="description">This article gives an account of the use of knowledges from emerging scientific fields in education and youth policy making under the Coalition government (2010-15) in the UK. We identify a common process of &amp;quot;translation&amp;quot; and offer three illustrations of policy-making in the UK that utilise diverse knowledges produced in academic fields (neuroscience, network theory and well-being). This production of &amp;quot;new knowledges&amp;quot; in policy contexts allows for the identification of sites of policy intervention. This process of translation underlies a series of diverse revisions of the rational subject of policy. Collectively, these revisions amount to a change in policy-making and the emergence of a different subject of neoliberal policy. This subject is not an excluded alterity to an included rational subject of neoliberalism, but a &amp;quot;plastic subject&amp;quot; characterised by its multiplicity. The plastic subject does not contradict the rational subject as central to neoliberal policy-making, but diversifies it.</str>

    <str name="title">Negotiating Queer and Religious Identities in Higher Education: Queering &amp;quot;Progression&amp;quot; in the &amp;quot;University Experience&amp;quot;</str>

    <str name="description">This article addresses the negotiation of &amp;quot;queer religious&amp;quot; student identities in UK higher education. The &amp;quot;university experience&amp;quot; has generally been characterised as a period of intense transformation and self-exploration, with complex and overlapping personal and social influences significantly shaping educational spaces, subjects and subjectivities. Engaging with ideas about progressive tolerance and becoming, often contrasted against &amp;quot;backwards&amp;quot; religious homophobia as a sentiment/space/subject &amp;quot;outside&amp;quot; education, this article follows the experiences and expectations of queer Christian students. In asking whether notions of &amp;quot;queering higher education&amp;quot; (Rumens 2014) &amp;quot;fit&amp;quot; with queer-identifying religious youth, the article explores how educational experiences are narrated and made sense of as &amp;quot;progressive&amp;quot;. Educational transitions allow (some) sexual-religious subjects to negotiate identities more freely, albeit with ongoing constraints. Yet perceptions of what, where and who is deemed &amp;quot;progressive&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;backwards&amp;quot; with regard to sexuality and religion need to be met with caution, where the &amp;quot;university experience&amp;quot; can shape and shake sexual-religious identity.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Gholami, Reza</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Taking the English National Curriculum as its main example, this article argues that an overly nationalistic, normative and &amp;quot;fact-based&amp;quot; citizenship education curriculum is failing to engage the dimensions of young people's identities which they experience as deeply meaningful. There is thus a chasm--albeit a false one--between official discourses and pedagogies of citizenship and what young people consider to be their &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; selves. I argue that citizenship education must develop a more sophisticated understanding of the complexities of how identities are formed and performed, especially in light of globalisation and increasing migration. I also make a somewhat unorthodox argument for conceptualising &amp;quot;relating-to-otherness&amp;quot; in the same way that we think of music consumption. This has implications for how we experience, interpret, value and create &amp;quot;others&amp;quot;. The article also makes some recommendations for how these ideas can begin to be implemented in educational settings.</str>

    <str name="title">Busy yet Passive: (Non-)Decision-Making in School Governing Bodies</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Young, Helen</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">School governing bodies in England have considerable powers and duties, and their formal role positions them as decision-makers. This article draws on qualitative research in the governing bodies of four maintained schools. Using deliberative democracy as a sensitising concept, the article considers some processes by which decisions are made (or not made) in governing bodies. Without claiming that governors never make decisions, it explores constraints and limitations on their ability to do so. Governors exhibit a paradoxical combination of busy-ness and passivity. On the one hand, governing bodies are constituted and structured around activity and technically decisions were made. On the other, decisions could rarely be attributed to active choices by governors. Rather, their more passive agreement with actions and positions was presented as almost unavoidable &amp;quot;common sense,&amp;quot; either due to the national policy context or the headteacher's presentation of the available options.</str>

    <str name="description">In recent years, many teachers suffered different kinds of negative emotions in the context of education reforms. A typical explanation was that the education reforms disempowered teachers in teaching, so teachers were forced to do much non-instructional work. Teachers considered their work meaningless but were powerless to change it, and eventually indulged themselves in negative emotions. However, the present research suggested that this explanation had neglected teacher agency and might be incomplete. Arguing from the perspective of social constructionism, the research showed that teachers in Hong Kong experienced negative emotions in education reforms because, on top of the disempowerment, the reforms structurally displaced teachers' educational goals with administrative goals. The goal displacement impeded teachers' evaluation of the instructional values of their work. Thus, teachers perceived their work as inconsistent with their major purpose of teaching (i.e. making a difference) and they felt negative towards work.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article critically considers the promise of computer adaptive testing (CAT) and digital data to provide better and quicker data that will improve the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of schooling. In particular, it uses the case of the Australian NAPLAN test that will become an online, adaptive test from 2016. The article argues that CATs are specific examples of technological ensembles which are producing, and working through, new subjectivities. In particular, CATs leverage opportunities for big data and algorithmic approaches to education that are symptomatic of what Deleuze saw as the shift from disciplinary to control institutions and societies.</str>

    <str name="description">&amp;quot;Delayed participation&amp;quot; in higher education (HE) is an increasingly important feature of modern HE systems in many countries. Despite this, surprisingly little empirical research has been undertaken seeking to better understand levels of delayed adult participation in HE across Europe. The present article responds to this gap by analysing country-level data on delayed adult participation in HE across 15 European countries and by modelling associations between participation levels and a range of theoretically derived economic, social, demographic and systemic factors. The findings suggest that there is considerably more cross-national variation in levels of adult delayed participation and that prevalent typologies of HE, such as Trow's, fail to give recognition to the importance of delayed participation. The modelling work finds that social and demographic factors exhibit relatively strong associations with delayed participation in HE. This questions the pre-eminence of economic factors within much of the academic literature, policy discourse and policy activity.</str>

    <str name="description">This article investigates the social justice dispositions of teachers and principals in secondary schools as inferred from their metaphoric expressions. Drawing on a Bourdieuian account of disposition, our focus is the use of metaphor as a methodological tool to identify and reveal these otherwise latent forces within our data. Our analysis shows evidence of redistributive, recognitive and activist conceptions of social justice. We argue that these three social justice dispositions may be insufficient to meaningfully address persisting inequalities in the school system and that a capability-based social justice disposition--absent in our data--is needed. We conclude by highlighting that: social justice dispositions can change; a valid interpretation of metaphors requires 'contextual stabilization'; and metaphors for social justice are differently constructed in different contexts, influenced by the different social, cultural and material conditions of schools.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores the growing importance of measures of progress in judgements of schools' effectiveness in England, with a focus on the role of the early years (settings for children aged 2-5) in providing data for these measures. Qualitative data from a research project involving three diverse school-based and pre-compulsory early years settings are used to explore how teachers and school leaders prioritise the collection of data in their every-day practice, in order to show how children make continual progress. The need for a narrative of progress as children move up through the primary school, an &amp;quot;Ofsted story&amp;quot; for the school inspection service, is discussed alongside recent policy which requires a &amp;quot;baseline&amp;quot; assessment at age four. We argue that there is a reification of progress in schools and early years settings, and that this changes the status of early years within the sector.</str>

    <str name="description">Rather than assessing its causal effect on educational attainment, the authors of this article aim to use the concept of cultural capital to define a huge, complex and interconnected collection of educational and school strategies adopted by students and families and to examine the way that these strategies are related to school inequalities. Data analysed come from the 2009 Italian survey for the Program for International Student Assessment run by the OECD. A Latent Class Regression Analysis has been applied to categorize four groups of individuals who share specific cultural habits, educational dispositions and choices, and social status; in short, the four groups differentiate individuals with a different endowment of the intangible asset, cultural capital. Moreover, using the socio-economic status as a covariate we link the latent class membership probability with individuals' social standing and, consequently school choices.</str>

    <str name="title">Reproducing Vulnerability: A Bourdieuian Analysis of Readers Who Struggle in Neoliberal Times</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Jaeger, Elizabeth L.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The neoliberal agenda promotes education as a route toward success in university and career. However, a neoliberal economy requires large numbers of workers willing to accept low-paying, dead-end jobs. The students most likely to take these jobs are those who have struggled with literacy and so schools must, in Bourdieu's terms, re/produce, vulnerable readers. This paper tracks the ways in which the neoliberal economy depends on these readers and how schools participate in this process of re/production: from educational policy, to instructional context, to reader identity. In contrast, from a radical democratic viewpoint, the primary goal of schooling is civic engagement and such engagement is bolstered by universal literacy. The paper concludes with alternatives in the realms of policy and classroom practice that are more likely to support teachers and students and foster radical democratic views.</str>

    <str name="title">Conceptualising the Surveillance of Teachers</str>
    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Schools are risky places: the risk of a poor Ofsted report, the risk of sliding down league tables, the risk of teachers abusing children, the risk of teachers being falsely accused of abuse. As a result of risk anxiety and the ever-increasing sophistication of technology, the surveillance of teachers has proliferated, becoming a future-oriented pursuit to manage this risk. Drawing on the surveillance studies literature, this article attempts to theorise the surveillance of teachers. Firstly the article argues that there are three types of teacher surveillance: the vertical perpetuated by Ofsted and senior school leaders such as teaching observations and learning walks, but also students recording their teachers on mobile phones; horizontal surveillance enacted by peers in terms of concertive control, but also parental surveillance via online and offline networks; and, finally, intrapersonal surveillance embracing reflective practice, data reporting and self-policing proximity from children. The article then concludes by arguing that while surveillance in schools embraces the themes of modern surveillance in general, by doggedly retaining the proximal and the interpersonal, it should be considered a hybrid form between traditional and modern forms of surveillance.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines the different uses of equality in one elite international school in India. We focus on how conceptions of equality can be enrolled into particular scripts of benevolence and gifting through which elite distinctions are constituted and enacted. Our analysis of interviews with students, teachers and parents in the school highlights three dominant and interrelated uses of equality that are examined with respect to entrepreneurial social ideals in contemporary neoliberal India: equality for profit; equality as deferred; and equality as a differential inclusion of the poor. We call this concept &amp;quot;enterprise equality&amp;quot; and consider its performative effects, namely in reconstituting and justifying normative inequality. Enterprise equality does two related things which have significant global consequences: it can function as a process of &amp;quot;decontestation&amp;quot;--a way to &amp;quot;block hearing&amp;quot; about alternative political/economic arrangements of equality; and it can reaffirm the cultural rhetoric of the elite as meritorious in their privilege.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article takes a historical approach to the rise and fall of the public university, relating its fate to specific developments in public policy. Particular attention will be paid to the United Kingdom since it has developed an explicit drive towards the marketization of higher education in the context of an earlier commitment to public higher education, although the latter was initially first developed in the United States. Both countries are typically characterized as liberal policy regimes and therefore the article considers how wider social structures are implicated in recent changes to higher education. In particular, the article addresses how the functions of the university and its corporate form are being transformed and relates this to wider developments in the nature of the corporation and the relation between business and citizenship (or market and democracy).</str>

    <str name="description">The aim of this article is to explore the structure of social capital in peer networks and its relation to the unequal access of educational resources within mathematics classrooms. We hypothesise that learners can gain access to mathematics through friendship networks which provide more or less help from peers that might sustain (or curtail) their mathematics learning based on a Bourdieusian framework. We report a social network analysis of mutually-recognised helping within friendship groups. This is complemented by observation and interviews that illustrate how different classrooms have different network structures, positioning learners of different ethnic minorities and genders in significantly different ways regarding access to learning. We argue that friendship networks mediate social capital and access to further cultural capital, and that this may help explain structural differences in attainment. Because ethnicity and gender, &amp;quot;inter alia,&amp;quot; mediate friendship networks, they also mediate access to capital in the classroom.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Çelik, Çetin</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Resilience research has increasingly gained ground in the field of education research, due to its potential for ameliorating inequalities. This article deals with the emergence of educational resilience, with particular attention to parental network structure, by employing a Bourdieusian social and cultural capital approach. While much of the literature discusses resilience normatively as a personal trait, this article frames it as an outcome of larger societal processes. Drawing on a comparative study of the experiences of resilient student-mother and dropout-mother pairs living in inner-city areas of Istanbul, the article illustrates that the emergence of resilience is strongly linked to resources such as parental networks and that parental networks significantly differ along the nexus of ethnicity.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Courtney, Steven J.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article builds on the established notion that schools are hierarchised through policy, accruing different amounts and types of symbolic capital, by examining how this is reflected in the habitus of the leaders of new, privileged school types. The article uses Bourdieu's concept of hysteresis, or a dislocation between the habitus which formerly produced success in the field and the habitus currently necessary following changes in field conditions. Using crafted narrative accounts from two headteachers, I argue that rather than simply being an effect of change, hysteresis may be an actively sought outcome whereby the state intervenes in a field--education--to deprivilege welfarist leaders and privilege corporatised leaders through structurally facilitating their habitus and mandating its dispositions for the field. However, insofar as deprivileged actors may draw strength and an identity from rejecting corporatisation, the concept of hysteresis must be extended to include notions of agentic dissidence.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lehmann, Wolfgang</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article reviews three books: (1) &amp;quot;Access to Higher Education: Theoretical Perspectives and Contemporary Challenges&amp;quot; (edited by A. Mountford-Zimdars and N. Harrison); (2) &amp;quot;Student Lives in Crisis: Deepening Inequality in Times of Austerity&amp;quot; (L. Antonucci); and (3) &amp;quot;Higher Education, Social Class and Social Mobility: The Degree Generation&amp;quot; (A. M. Bathmaker, N. Ingram, J. Abrahams, A. Hoare, R. Waller, and H. Bradley). Drawing on a range of theoretical and conceptual perspectives, all three books provide important contributions to the understanding of the important role class plays in the formation of young people's decisions to attend post-secondary education, their experiences in it, and the value they can gain from a degree once they have graduated. In addition to the centrality of class, the books also address the roles of race and gender, as well as national and institutional contexts that shape access to and experiences in higher education (HE). On their own, each of the three books appeals to quite different readerships. Those interested in access issues will find a wealth of empirical, theoretical, and comparative information in &amp;quot;Access to Higher Education&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Student Lives in Crisis&amp;quot; will appeal to readers concerned about the material circumstances that shape university experiences; whereas &amp;quot;Higher Education, Social Class and Social Mobility&amp;quot; adds a methodologically rich voice to the growing body of literature that takes a Bourdieusian, cultural approach. Read together, however, the diversity of perspectives offers readers rich accounts of the complex relationship between class and HE.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Ortiga, Yasmin Y.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article demonstrates how neoliberal higher education has come to play a distinct role in the global market for migrant labor, where a growing number of developing nations educate its citizens for overseas work in order to maximize future monetary remittances. Located in the Philippines, this study shows how local colleges and universities attempt to impose an ideal notion of flexibility, quickly shifting academic manpower and resources to programs that would produce the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; types of workers to address foreign labor demands. Based on qualitative interviews with Filipino college educators and students, the article then discusses how such &amp;quot;flexible&amp;quot; strategies undermine the job security of college faculty and lead to the constant restructuring of physical space within university campuses. Such changes negatively affect both students and teachers.</str>

    <str name="description">Contemporary global economic contexts are shaped by a neo-liberal paradigm of hyper-individualism and meritocracy strongly influencing national policies in education and welfare. As social safety nets diminish, citizens are expected to be more personally accountable. This creates challenges for the poor and marginalised who are positionally disadvantaged in highly competitive neo-capitalist economies. Young people from such social categories are particularly vulnerable. Resource poor, many struggle to connect with schools and find meaning in a world that has relegated them to the margins. They make up the apparently growing numbers of &amp;quot;disengaged&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;at risk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dangerous&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sick&amp;quot; youth who have become a focal point for official interventions that may be punitive and/or therapeutic or medical. Drawing upon the contrasting perspectives of teaching staff and youth workers in one Australian state, this article argues for a change in the way schooling authorities construct and respond to the phenomenon of schooling &amp;quot;disengagement&amp;quot;.</str>

    <str name="description">Although short-term mobility programmes are increasingly promoted to university students as sources of competitive advantage, there is little research on academic learnings arising from these initiatives. A &amp;quot;field analysis&amp;quot; of outbound mobility is undertaken to identify convergences and disjunctures between institutional discourses, staff perceptions and student experiences at one Australian university where outbound mobility is actively promoted as a &amp;quot;strategy of distinction&amp;quot;. Self-reported &amp;quot;personal transformations&amp;quot; commonly associated with the mobility experience are interrogated in favour of alternative constructions of self-other relationships. An argument is made for greater institutional effort to enable students to make critical connections with &amp;quot;other-ness&amp;quot; both in and out of place.</str>

    <str name="description">This article discusses friendships and peer groups of migrant and minority ethnic youth in schools in England and Spain, and critically considers them in relation to existing notions of &amp;quot;peer social capital&amp;quot; and bridging (heterogeneous) and bonding (homogeneous) peer networks. The article argues for an extended understanding of peer social capital and discusses the complex composition and outcomes of bridging and bonding peer networks.

    <str name="description">The aim of this article is to illustrate how Swedish schools construct different pedagogic identities in the way they marketize themselves. We examine through a Bernsteinian lens how upper secondary schools promote themselves; what identities are being called for by the schools and how these identities are expressed. Moreover, the article intends to study how these identities are reflected in studied school actors and how they can be understood in relation to the labour market. We have analysed texts from various kinds of marketing materials, including websites and prospectuses of the schools. The empirical data also include interviews with various school actors. In addition, we attended and recorded observations at open houses and school fairs. Our findings indicate a strong differentiated market-oriented education system, mediated not only through distinctions in courses and programmes, but also through schools creating highly specific niches and targeting specific students as valuable commodities.</str>

    <str name="description">Social class mobility from grandparent to grandchild is a relatively neglected topic. Grandparents today are often healthier and more active, and have longer relationships with their grandchildren than in previous generations. We used data from the UK's Millennium Cohort Study (n = 8570) to investigate the influence of maternal and paternal grandparents' social class on the aspirations of children at age seven. Using path analysis and controlling for family income, mother's and father's education, lone motherhood, and child's ethnicity and gender, we found very small direct effects from the paternal grandmother's social class to the grandchild's classed aspirations, and small, indirect effects, via parents' class, of grandparents' class on child's classed aspirations. Multi-group analyses found few differences by ethnicity and gender. There was no evidence that, at this age, mixed-class parentage raises the aspirations of working-class children (the &amp;quot;sunken middle-class&amp;quot; hypothesis).</str>

    <str name="description">Research in the sociology of education argues that the educational system provides different learning opportunities for students with different socioeconomic backgrounds and that this circumstance makes the educational process an important institutional context for the reproduction of educational inequality. Using combined survey and register data for more than 56,000 students in 825 schools, this article conducts the first empirical test of the argument that instructional strategies which emphasize student responsibility and activity, also referred to as student-centered instruction, increase educational inequality. We analyze whether the impact of student-centered instructional strategies on academic achievement differs for students with different socioeconomic backgrounds. Results suggest that a student-centered instructional strategy has a negative impact on academic achievement in general, and for students with low parental education in particular. Our findings support the argument that the instructional strategy of schools is an important mechanism in generating educational inequality through the stratification of learning opportunities.</str>

      <str>Tomlinson, Michael</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article first offers a survey of what has become an area of increasing interest in higher education: the rise of the so-called &amp;quot;student-consumer&amp;quot;. This has been linked in part to the marketisation of higher education and the increased personal financial contributions individual students make towards their higher education. Drawing upon a qualitative study with students across seven different UK higher education institutions, the article shows that while there is evidence of growing identification with a consumer-orientated approach, this does not fundamentally capture their perspectives and relationships to higher education. The article shows the degree of variability in attitude and approaches towards consumerism of higher education and how students still perceive higher education in ways that do not conform to the ideal student-consumer approach. The implications for university relations and how policy-makers and institutions themselves approach the issue are discussed.</str>

    <str name="description">Internships are now widely promoted as a valuable means of enhancing graduate employability. However, little is known about student perceptions of internships. Drawing on data from a pre-1992 university, two types of graduate are identified: engagers and disengagers. The engagers valued internship opportunities while the disengagers perceived these roles as exploitative and worthless. Few were able to distinguish paid, structured internship opportunities from unpaid, exploitative roles. We conclude that higher education institutes need to be more proactive in extolling the value of paid internships to all students and not just those most likely to engage with their services.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines an effort to spatially re-organise urban public schools in the largest city in Turkey. Recently, the Turkish government has made an effort to relocate inner-city public schools in Istanbul to less desirable parts of the city. Analysing how education policy in the country is tied to wider political mechanisms and considering the results of the studies carried out in various parts of the world, this article argues that the interaction between education and urban life in Turkey displays unique characteristics in terms of the populations implicated in the policy change and the spaces transformed as a result. Two salient characteristics are the involvement of the secular middle class and the perception by them that school relocations entail de-secularisation of the city and the education system. The article argues that these characteristics should be conceptualised in the context of particular conjunctures of forces driven by different contradictions.</str>

    <str name="description">Public education is commonly perceived as a social good endowed with the capacity to equalise western citizens' chance of 'success'. In 2008 Australia introduced standardised testing and reporting procedures to improve educational quality and equity through two policy tools (NAPLAN/MySchool). Ensuing public debate culminated in two Senate Inquiries. Qualitative critical analysis of all (N = 268) submissions to Inquiry One evidenced two major themes: marketisation and data (mis)use; and competition, commodification and practice. Marketisation's hegemony shaped discourse and recommendations, with institutions and individuals promoting/engaging in self-aggrandising performance-driven activities seeking market advantage, often whilst simultaneously objecting. Submissions largely opposed MySchool and supported NAPLAN despite detailing maladaptive impacts and recommending changes. Drawing upon Latour, we suggest actors' interactions with these tools (re)produced and re-enacted marketisation principles. Where marketisation, commodification or political rhetoric drives educational change, one ought to be cautious authentic approaches are not truncated by stakeholders lacking legitimate means to compete for resources or social status.</str>

With this article we aim to make a contribution to the domain of educational research. We explore strategies that schools can adopt to improve the involvement of Roma parents. Using a theory-based stakeholder evaluation, we more specifically analyse how the organizational model of a primary school contributes to the establishment of trust between both parties. The results show that the theoretical principles guiding the daily school practices and interventions are aligned with the needs and specificity of the target audience, but are also broadly supported by the school staff. As such, the organizational structure of the school contributes to the support of the school staff for the global school vision and to the overall success of the approach. Nevertheless, some tension remains between team members working on the &amp;quot;care&amp;quot; aspect and teachers working solely within the classroom.</str>

    <str name="description">This article is based on a comparative study of working-class students' experiences in English and Irish higher education. It highlights the lack of comparative studies on this topic based on qualitative research and why filling this gap is important in understanding access and widening participation. Drawing on biographical interviews with 139 people in a range of elite and non-elite institutions, the article discusses similarities as well as some differences between the data from the two countries in terms of class, identity and how working-class students view and value higher education. It maps out how the research relates to recent debates over social class and outlines the theoretical implications of these findings.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines &amp;quot;neoliberalism&amp;quot; inside two American public high schools. The work of one leading critical theorist, Mark Olssen, is explained and examined. Particular attention is paid to Olssen's concepts of &amp;quot;homo economicus&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;manipulatable man.&amp;quot; It is concluded that Olssen's theories on neoliberalism accurately describe developments in public education in the West since the early 1980s. It is also believed that his theories could benefit from a study that &amp;quot;looks inside the black box&amp;quot; and reveals what neoliberalism looks like inside schools. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 teachers and two principals at two public high schools in the American state of Louisiana. Analysis reveals that an educator's sense of professional autonomy relates to students' socioeconomic backgrounds. That is, educators at poor schools tend to have dramatically less freedom from local school boards than educators in non-poor schools.</str>

    <str name="description">Although delinquency in US schools is near historic lows, concern over delinquency in US schools remains a pressing issue among school officials, parents, and policy-makers. Many scholars argue that the current approach to discipline in the United States is highly punitive. While some projects have assessed the effect of punitive security on students' perception of safety and general well-being, little attention has been given to understanding the role these measures play in extracurricular activity. Using the Educational Longitudinal Study (2002/2004), we examine the role of security measures in predicting student extracurricular activity cross-sectionally and over time. Results show that schools with greater numbers of security measures have students who are less involved in extracurricular activities, although the presence of security measures does not relate to decreased levels of participation over time.</str>

    <str name="title">Reappraising the Pedagogic Device's Evaluative Rules: State-Reformed Examinations of Chinese Middle Schools in Singapore</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Wong, Ting-Hong</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Bernstein's theory of the pedagogic device has two under-developed elements as far as its treatments of evaluative rules are concerned. It has never explained the processes through which an assessment's hegemony is erected, and it overlooks the fact that evaluations can also be crucial apparatuses in social selection and exclusion. Using the historical example of state exam reforms on Chinese middle schools from the late-1950s to the mid-1960s, I seek to rectify these deficiencies in this article. I contend that assessments could actualize official pedagogic discourse more effectively when they also exert profound impacts on allocation of valued social positions and educational opportunities. My contention is illustrated by the case of postwar Singapore, where the ruling regime had more success in replacing the Sino-centric pedagogic discourse of Chinese institutions with a more Singaporean-centered one after state-run exams targeted to students' futures in education and employment were imposed.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Isling Poromaa, Pär</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article examines the objective possibilities of Swedish schools to offer an equal and functional pedagogical practice for students' acquisition of knowledge and skills. The data consist of policy documents, observations, and interviews with students, teachers, and head teachers in three educational settings distinguished by different social demographics. The focus allows for a comparative understanding of how tangible objects generate formations of schools as a relational phenomenon depending on geographic location and social background of students. The article indicates that the impact of materiality lies in its preceding power. It shapes the condition of institutions visualised in architecture, buildings, and the quality of and design of facilities and artefacts. From this material root emanates schools' values, appeal, social status, and pedagogical organisations--school effects--that empower or weaken the school's attraction and self-confidence. Different materialities influence each school's institutional habitus, producing school effects with unequal educational outcomes.</str>

    <str name="description">Currently dominant human capital and knowledge economy rhetoric holds that education can raise wages, empower workers and enhance working conditions. Education, however, can also have the opposite impact in the workplace and labour market, an impact that has received only limited attention. In this article we draw together a broad range of literature focusing on youth and entry-level employment in order to analyse the different frames of status, process and promise in which education serves not as a &amp;quot;premium&amp;quot; but as a &amp;quot;penalty&amp;quot;, used to diminish worker power and claims to good conditions of employment in the present.</str>

      <str>Kulz, Christy</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper explores how the contradictions of neoliberal education reform and its companion, the self-made aspirational subject, are embodied by Sir Michael Wilshaw, former headteacher of Mossbourne Community Academy in Hackney, East London, through his leadership practices. Wilshaw creates powerful mobility and morality tales that pave over the contradictions and ambiguities inherent in the academies programme and Mossbourne's approach. Drawing on a larger study of Mossbourne, the paper focuses on how raced and classed pathological discourses are mobilised and inverted both by Wilshaw and policy rhetoric, cultivating compliance through a belief in the aspirational subject capable of transcending social structures. The paper argues that neoliberal academy reforms are not about autonomy, but the imperative to comply with centralised policy demands at the expense of democratic participation and accountability.</str>

    <str name="description">This article investigates how risk perception amongst teachers within an outdoor educational initiative, Forest School, both shape and are shaped by their understandings of childhood, pedagogy and their own professional identity. Drawing on a social constructionist perspective in theorising risk and childhood, the article argues that contemporary, hyper-sensitised concerns regarding children's vulnerability emanate from both fears of the modern world, and the proclivity towards over-protection which these fears precipitate. Rather than treating this hyper-sensitivity as irrational or paranoid, the paper draws on socio-cultural theories and qualitative methods to interrogate how risk is perceived, managed and performed by teachers within an initiative which aims to reintroduce risk into children's lives. The research found that while these teachers' motivations to participate in Forest School were derived from a desire to expose children to formative risk-taking in the outdoors, the hegemonic cultural and institutional risk aversion which they were attempting to counter, aligned with their contested occupational identity, created tensions in how they managed and performed risk which militated against the full realisation of a Forest School pedagogy.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article examines how two primary schools in rural England with overwhelmingly White populations (of students and teachers) dealt with incidents of racist bullying in relation to their race equality policies. The data are drawn from in-depth interviews with parents, head teachers and teachers. The article draws on the work of Foucault to argue that students are situated in a &amp;quot;historical moment&amp;quot; in which schools acknowledge racism formally and publicly, but this does not reflect their informal, private practices. Consequently, whilst systems are established that could respond to racist bullying, in practice these do not necessarily emerge in the school. A local discourse emerges that counters suggestions of racism by pointing to the existence of anti-racist systems and describing racism as something distanced geographically and historically from rural settings. White identities are both privileged and protected by this process whilst non-White students are disadvantaged.</str>

      <str>Choi, Tat Heung</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article examines how educational transitions in Hong Kong are concurrently classed processes and practices, and how learner identity is developed and negotiated in an education system that prizes English as capital. Through the lens of habitus, the connected but distinct autobiographical accounts suggest that the stronger the insulation between the home and the school, the keener an individual's sensitivity may be towards class distinction in adapting to a new field. Learner identity associated with academic success is potentially negotiable and self-sustained through determination, self-regulation, and reflexive strategies, rendering the availability of resource support less important for working-class students' identity development.</str>

    <str name="title">Emotional Pedagogy and the Gendering of Social and Emotional Learning</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Evans, Rhiannon</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Social and emotional learning (SEL) has predominantly been conceptualised as a neurological process, which has precluded understanding of how social, cultural and material discourses inform the expression of emotional experiences. Gender remains a notable omission. This article explores the micro-practices through which gender structures the development of young people's emotional subjectivities within the context of a school-based SEL intervention. Particular emphasis is placed on the gendering strategies utilised by educational professionals during the course of their emotional pedagogy. Three strategies are considered: the overt coercion of girls to demonstrate their learning; the permission of boys' passivity, with their docile bodies being indicated as a signifier of participation; and the restricting of occasions for emotional expression in accordance with perceived gender norms. Efforts to inculcate students with a gendered emotional subjectivity mean that differential learning opportunities are on offer, raising concerns about the introduction of new forms of gendered educational inequalities.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Best, Shaun</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In his liquid-turn writings, Zygmunt Bauman has come to identify liquid modernity as a period of interregnum. Education has a central role to play within the contemporary interregnum by opening up a new public sphere for dialogue. However, the processes of liquefaction manifest themselves in conditions that severely limit a person's ability to exercise their human agency. Bauman provides no indication of how the educators can escape the processes that limit agency, nor does he explain how educators can combat the seductive consumerism that students need to overcome before they can engage in a reconstruction of the public sphere.</str>

    <str name="description">This article investigates whether schools that match Coalition Government criteria for excellence can enable hardworking students, regardless of background, to achieve good examination results and improved chances of social mobility. Students at two case-study academies were interviewed about family influences on their development and choice of education and employment pathways. In a &amp;quot;best case&amp;quot; scenario, where prototype academies have rigorously implemented government policy, are students less reliant than before on family resources, influences and dispositions? Our data suggest that family background continues to be an important influence on participants' attitudes, values, occupational interests and preferences. There are few signs that the new academy regime is creating improved opportunities for social mobility.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Singh, Parlo</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Researchers interested in new modes of social control and regulation through pedagogic means have increasingly drawn on Bernstein's theories of social control through pedagogic means and the emergence of a totally pedagogised society. This article explores this aspect of the Bernsteinian theoretical project by extrapolating and contrasting Foucault's and Bernstein's theories of power knowledge relations, pedagogic discourse and different types of knowledge structures. It elaborates on Bernstein's theory of the complex division of labour within the field of symbolic control, consisting of agents from different class factions engaged in conflicts and struggles over the production and recontextualisation of different types of scientific knowledge. The article provides two case studies of empirical research to illustrate how Bernstein's concepts can be used to theorise different modes of pedagogic governance. It demonstrates the possibilities of Bernstein's later theoretical oeuvre to studies of social reproduction, interruption and change in and through pedagogic relations.</str>

    <str name="description">This article considers the effect of information technology upon teaching, learning and research in the &amp;quot;digital university&amp;quot;. In less than a generation the university has become a business like any other. It does so in the determining context of neoliberal globalisation and the computer revolution. The university develops through what we may now see as a disastrous &amp;quot;category error&amp;quot;. The article argues that humans are analogue creatures who have constructed analogue worlds that they recognise in large measure, in nature. Digital logic is nowhere recognised in nature, and is ultimately alien to us. The university is the key institution for enabling us to understand who and what we are, yet it is being undermined through the suffusion of the market logic and the digital technologies that drive it from a past we look to less, to a present we dwell in more, and a future we are less able to shape.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article argues that education reform agendas which use policy levers, standardised testing and new regulatory authorities to steer teachers' work at a distance are creating a new temporal politics. Evidence from interviews with teachers and principals in Australian schools suggests that these reforms are impacting on individual experiences of the rhythms of their day-to-day work. First, there is a disquieting perception of an acceleration of their working life. Second, and related, many teachers and principals spoke of feeling &amp;quot;out of time&amp;quot; or out of rhythm, with the new expectations of their work. Using Deleuze's control societies, we posit that this arrhythmia exemplifies the experience of the classroom being &amp;quot;opened up&amp;quot; for the purposes of comparison. This breakdown of the enclosed classroom is affected through the datafication of teaching.</str>

    <str name="description">This article discusses how the introduction of technology has led to a fundamental shift in the relationship between education and time. As a means of analysing the extent of such changes on pupils from different backgrounds, I use Bernstein's &amp;quot;conditions for democracy&amp;quot; as a framework for evaluating the impact new understandings of time in education are having on disadvantaged social groups in England. I conclude that Bernstein's framework presents a useful way of illuminating the complex interplay of personal agency and the external environment. Consequently, here we see that new definitions of time in education, specifically with regard to synchronous versus asynchronous learning, have resulted in new inequalities for those in deprived areas.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>McLeod, Julie</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores how temporality and temporal regimes might be engaged in qualitative research in the sociology of education, proposing that such questions matter in relation to how research is done, not only to the topics and themes researched. The article shows how temporality enters into research designs, practices and imaginaries, arguing that research methodologies mobilise intersecting temporalities. Debates in the philosophy of history regarding the collision of temporalities are canvassed, and approaches are outlined for conceptualising temporality in reference to qualitative studies. To illustrate these arguments, an account is offered of theoretical and methodological approaches framing a new qualitative longitudinal study of young people and secondary schooling in Australia; to highlight the historicity of methodologies, comparisons are also drawn between this study and an earlier related longitudinal study undertaken in the 1990s. The article concludes by inviting a re-consideration of the possibilities for a renewal of historical sociology of education.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Accelerationism is a theoretical movement that seeks to mobilise reason and technological development as a strategy for moving beyond capitalism. The first wave of accelerationism took the effects of capitalism at their most pernicious and suggested that they have not gone far enough. More recent work has complicated this project and explored political, epistemic and aesthetic accelerations. The central push to accelerate, and therefore to manifestly alter time, has consequences in terms of how one understands temporality in education. This article outlines the development of accelerationism and examines whether this theoretical movement can aid critical analysis of the growing presence in education of commercial technology providers, new modes of data analytics, and the application of machine learning algorithms to analyse data. These developments provide a useful example in relation to which a critical question can be asked: is it possible to accelerate technological development in education separate from its capitalist development?</str>

    <str name="description">Modern societies are characterised by forms of acceleration, which influence social processes. Sociologist Hartmut Rosa has systematised temporal structures by focusing on three categories of social acceleration: technical acceleration, acceleration of social change, and acceleration of the pace of life. All three processes of acceleration are closely linked to processes of internationalisation and globalisation. Given this background, developments in the context of school education are analysed in this article, paying special attention to the question of which areas of academic learning the categories of social acceleration affect and whether internationalisation and globalisation speed up these processes. The analyses show that effects of globalisation in the fields of management, market, and performance on education are closely linked to social acceleration.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">In 2014, Thomas Piketty's &amp;quot;Capital in the Twenty-first Century&amp;quot; rocked the economic and political world, with its argument that inequality is destined to increase; in the field of education, however, this book has been almost entirely ignored. I argue that Piketty's treatise is relevant to educational theories for three reasons: his rejection of meritocracy contributes to theories of social mobility; his critique of human capital theory provides fodder for debates about educational purpose; and his interdisciplinary analysis supports the political economy tradition in education. However, I also argue that it is necessary to move beyond the economic determinism in Piketty's arguments, to explore the transformative potential of education as a consciousness-raising process, the agency of communities, the production process, and alternative solutions to inequality. I argue that education scholars should use the renewed interest in inequality generated by Piketty's book to shift the dominant discourses about education, schools, and social justice.</str>

    <str name="description">Thomas Piketty's &amp;quot;Capital in the Twenty-first Century&amp;quot; documents the foreboding nature of rising wealth inequality in the twenty-first century. In an effort to promote a more just and democratic global society and rein in the unfettered accumulation of wealth by the few, Piketty calls for a global progressive annual tax on corporate capital. Employing a critical feminist and race perspective on the political economy, this article examines Piketty's historical understanding of inequality, and considers how his proposed solution to redistribute corporate profits through a global tax on corporate capital would impact the racialized, gendered, and geographically based inequalities experienced by marginalized girls and women, including access to education, employment, and other basic needs. The article argues that Piketty's proposed solution would leave corporate strategies for accumulating wealth untouched, and would do little to transform the durable, deeply entrenched inequalities experienced by poor, racialized girls and women.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Robertson, Susan Lee</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">When Piketty's book &amp;quot;Capital in the Twenty-first Century&amp;quot; was released in 2014, it became an overnight success. Piketty focused on the concentration of wealth in a tiny social elite, and showed that their wealth had increased following the financial crisis in 2008. Yet the value of Piketty's book offers something more than this for social scientists concerned with social inequalities. His work on a large data-set of long-run income and wealth statistics illustrates that the assumptions and models which have guided the work of neoclassical economists are flawed, but that societal arrangements matter. Yet despite this insight, Piketty's solution to the problem of inequality is to argue that &amp;quot;… the best way to reduce inequalities with respect to labor … is to invest in education&amp;quot;. In this article I argue that there are major problems with this proposed solution and outline three lacunae that need to be addressed.</str>

    <str name="description">Piketty's &amp;quot;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&amp;quot; has brought the issue of inequality to the centre of political debate. This article explores contemporary research on the relationship between education and inequality in conflict-affected contexts with a view to seeing how Piketty's work speaks to these issues as a field of research and practice. The article provides a critique of Piketty's approach, arguing for a broader, interdisciplinary and holistic approach to exploring and addressing inequality in education in conflict-affected contexts in their multiple economic, cultural and political dimensions. In doing so the article also lays out an analytical framework inspired by cultural political economy for researching education systems in conflict contexts which seeks to go beyond narrow human capital framings of education and address the multiple potential of education to promote sustainable peace and development in and through education.</str>

    <str name="title">The Under-Recognition of the Significance of Social Class Conceptions of Education in Piketty's &amp;quot;Capital&amp;quot;</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Dale, Roger</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Piketty's &amp;quot;Capital&amp;quot; has created enormous interest around the world, not least in educational circles. One reason for this may be his readiness to refer, in a book largely focused on economic history, to the ways that education has, and might, contribute to better and more equal social outcomes. This article welcomes this approach, but argues that Piketty's suggestions remain somewhat limited due to his adherence to a more or less distributional, rather than relational, approach, and then sets out to address this issue by arguing that the assumption that it is the distribution of credentials which accounts for their contribution is mistaken. Instead, the article advances arguments which recognize the separate contributions of the content of credentials, and their valorization. The main focus of this article is thus on the different ways educational credentials are realized, which, it is argued, is a major basis for the maintenance of educational inequality.</str>

    <str name="description">While scholars have analyzed global higher education (HE) competition, they have largely failed to address how global spaces of equivalence are tied both to coloniality and to competition. Using the OECD's International Assessment of Higher Education Learning Outcomes (AHELO) as a case study and drawing on concepts from coloniality including Fanon's zone of being/non-being and Mignolo's geopolitics of knowledge, we reveal how coloniality underpins the desire for global spaces of equivalence through: the desire for opportunity and belonging; and the desire for recognition and pride. We illuminate how the nature of global competition is not simply tied to market-based economic or political rationalities, but also operates under psychosocial dimensions interlinked with belonging in the international community. We argue that AHELO represents the mediation and internalization of a HE competition focused on teaching and learning, which reproduces coloniality by valuing characteristics of the enterprising, globally competitive institution.</str>

    <str name="description">Universities, as part of the neoliberal regime imposed on them, are being co-opted into a &amp;quot;war for talent&amp;quot;, in which national economic success is heavily invested. We examine part of this &amp;quot;war&amp;quot; that affects universities directly--the recruitment of &amp;quot;the brightest and the best&amp;quot; internationally mobile students and their subsequent retention by the host country as high-skill workers. After an account of this war for talent and its implications for higher education, we review the literature on study-migration transitions by international students and identify gaps in both data and theorization. We propose a three-part model that uses the notion of &amp;quot;flows&amp;quot; to organize a research agenda in this field and the possible roles of universities in implementing it. We conclude that only by resisting full recruitment into this global talent war can academic researchers continue to maintain the integrity and value of their professional and disciplinary calling.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>David, Matthew</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">UK media coverage of global university league tables shows systematic bias towards the Russell Group, although also highlighting tensions within its membership. Coverage positions UK &amp;quot;elite&amp;quot; institutions between US superiority and Asian ascent. Coverage claims that league table results warrant UK university funding reform. However, league table data for all years to 2012 (when major funding reforms were implemented--most radically in England) do not show either US superiority or Asian ascent. Citation bias defines media content. Text itself is structured by three discursive &amp;quot;ratchets&amp;quot;: highlighting US successes but never failures, rising Asian institutions but never falls, and claiming that UK results warrant the same policy irrespective of whether results improve or worsen. These combine with selective doubt by &amp;quot;elites&amp;quot; who question but are not questioned. These four discursive mechanisms fabricate an illusory threat of global competition. This threat is then used to warrant neo-liberal policies at home.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">International graduate students' occupational trajectories have rarely been studied, although many studies exist on their learning experiences in foreign universities. Based on 80 qualitative interviews, this article aims to understand how, where, and why these students obtain jobs in academe and corporations. I focus particularly on Korean professionals who received graduate degrees from US universities and who later obtained jobs in Korea or the United States. The theoretical component of this work is based on two important concepts--global cultural capital and global positional competition--both of which are seen to be based on a global hierarchy of academic degrees and professional knowledge. This study empirically tests and elaborates Phillip Brown's three rules of inclusion and exclusion in global positional competition. By looking at international students' transnational occupational trajectories, this study aims to understand how global education, transnational job opportunities, and social inclusion and exclusion interact in diverse ways.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Brøgger, Katja</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The initiation of the Bologna Process was accompanied by a radical transition of governance in higher education throughout Europe from government to governance. This article argues that this shift in the design of governing was connected to the need to subtly bypass the European Union (EU) subsidiarity principle that kept education out of the EU's legislative reach. The new mode of governing is orchestrated through the Open Method of Coordination (OMC), which constitutes the policy ontology of the Bologna Process. The OMC presents the ambition to harmonise education systems through standardisation as a main technology to govern performance. This article argues that the Bologna mode of governance is powered through the follow-up mechanisms that work as a material-affective infrastructure of the policy ontology. These monitoring techniques are affectively wired. They produce an affective politics of naming, shaming and faming that ignites a competitive, mimetic desire making the Bologna mode of governance feasible.</str>

    <str name="description">As higher education (HE) institutions globally become increasingly performative, competitive and corporatised in response to neoliberal rationalities, the exigencies of HE leadership are being realigned to accommodate its value system. This article draws on recent British Council-funded research, including 30 semi-structured interviews, to explore women's engagement with leadership in HE in South Asia. A potent affective economy was discovered. Leadership was associated with affects such as competitiveness, aggression, impropriety, stress and anxiety, in ways that were intensified by highly patriarchal and corporatised HE cultures. Indeed, its difficulties and toxicities meant that leadership was rejected or resisted as an object of desire by many women. We illuminate how different forms of competition contribute to the affective economy of HE leadership. The research also raises wider questions about the possibilities of disrupting dominant neoliberal constructions of HE if those who question such values are excluded (or self-exclude) from leadership positions.</str>

    <str name="description">Drawing on Foucault's elaboration of neoliberalism as a positive form of state power, the ascendancy of neoliberalism in higher education in Britain is examined in terms of the displacement of public good models of governance, and their replacement with individualised incentives and performance targets, heralding new and more stringent conceptions of accountability and monitoring across the higher education sector. After surveying the defeat of the public good models, the article seeks to better understand the deployment of neoliberal strategies of accountability and then assess the role that these changes entail for the university sector in general. Impact assessment, I claim, represents a new, more sinister phase of neoliberal control. In the concluding section it is suggested that such accountability models are not incompatible with the idea of the public good and, as a consequence, a meaningful notion of accountability can be accepted and yet prized apart from its neoliberal rationale.</str>

    <str name="description">This article contributes to the emerging theoretical construct of what has been called &amp;quot;transnational academic capitalism&amp;quot;, characterised by the blurring of traditional boundaries between public, private, local, regional and international, and between market-driven and critically transformative higher education visions. Here we examine how these issues are reflected in higher education policy in the Arab Gulf, asking: what kinds of capital are being constructed and traded? By and for whom? What is the relationship between higher education competition, governance and the public good? We find contradictory trends, which we see as strategic ambivalence pointing to country-specific readings of similar regional markets and attempts to hedge bets between rival forms of apparent capital. The exploration offers a counterpoint to more widely cited examples, hereby helping to shape new paradigmatic &amp;quot;glocalised&amp;quot; understandings of this field.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Mok, Ka Ho</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Globalisation and the evolution of the knowledge-based economy have caused dramatic worldwide changes in the character and functions of education, particularly higher education. In the search for global competitiveness, many emerging economies have begun to expand their higher education systems, which has significantly affected the relationship between higher education and graduate employment. Recently, international comparative studies have suggested that increasing enrolment in higher education does not always promote upward social mobility, and can intensify inequality in education. This article critically examines the impact of the expansion of higher education in East Asia on graduate employment and social mobility in the context of an increasingly globalising economy and changing labour market needs. The article discusses emerging trends in the Greater China region, with a particular focus on Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Taipei, and argues that the massification of higher education has not necessarily led to more occupational opportunities for youth or opportunities for upward social movement, particularly since the significant changes in the global labour market after the 2008 global financial crisis. On the contrary, the intensification of &amp;quot;positional competition&amp;quot; among college graduates seems to reflect growing social inequality.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Wong, Mei-Yee</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines the factors shaping teacher-student power relations, based on observations, interviews and document analysis from a Hong Kong study. It identifies and examines six factors: China's traditional culture of respect, examination-oriented teaching and religious culture were found to encourage imbalanced teacher-student power relations, whereas curriculum reform, values education and some school cultures facilitated relatively balanced teacher-student power relations. The paper depicts teacher-student power relations in Hong Kong as a reflection of multileveled intertwined interactions, and as affected by the interplay of various factors. It provides empirical evidence to supplement existing understandings of the nature of teacher--student power relations, especially in a non-western context with varied socio-cultural, educational, school and classroom levels.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines reflections on work placement experiences generated for the Creative Contexts website by higher education students. The article outlines the aims of Creative Contexts to generate and share placement experiences and stories. The article analyses the reflections films available on the website, and reveals a continuum of agency in which students' contributions generally foreground the individual at the expense of the structural. The analysis reveals that whilst Creative Contexts can help foreground the subjective dimensions of employability, the students' focus on individual dispositions and attributes does little to question industry and placement norms and structural challenges.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Akar, Bassel</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Education for active citizenship continues to be a critical response for social cohesion and reconstruction in conflict-affected areas. Oftentimes, approaches to learning and teaching in such contexts can do as much harm as good. This study qualitatively examines 435 students' reflections of their civics classroom learning experiences and their existing conceptualisations of good citizenship. The majority of students revealed notions of citizenship representing high levels of engagement in community-building activities. Furthermore, students either described or illustrated how the prescriptive nature of the textbook and memorisation of material contradicted their notions of active citizenship. While details of how students conceptualised active citizenship illustrated formal and informal learning opportunities, the findings suggest that civics as currently instructed in classrooms may, by and large, be undermining the aims of education in Lebanon for active citizenship.</str>

    <str name="description">This article draws on the sociology of Basil Bernstein to show how his detailed theories of &amp;quot;recontextualisation&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;pedagogic device&amp;quot; provide useful analytic levers to examine the politics of educational change. We focus on recent policy developments that have significantly impacted Australian school education: the Program for International Student Assessment; the National Assessment Programme for Numeracy and Literacy; and the government's public dissemination of school achievement data through the MySchool website. The analysis illustrates the ways in which the logics of economic rationalism not only have become ubiquitous in Australian education policy, but have come to recontextualise--or reshape--discourses of social and educational equity through new norms of competition, standardisation and commensurability. In doing so, the paper highlights the value of a Bernsteinian approach to understanding the vernacular character of neoliberalism in contemporary educational policy.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines student accounts of credentials, talent and academic success, against a backdrop of the enduring liberal ideal of an education-based meritocracy. The article also examines Bourdieu's account of academic qualifications as the dominant source of institutionalised cultural capital, and concludes that it does not adequately account for comparative differences in the social structure of competition and ideological shifts in class (re)production in different national contexts. This analysis is based on an empirical investigation of elite students at Oxford University and Sciences Po in Paris. We investigated how they understand the competition for a livelihood and whether they see themselves as more &amp;quot;talented&amp;quot; than students from non-elite universities. This investigation revealed important similarities and differences between British and French students that have significant sociological implications for the (re)production and legitimation of educational and labour market inequalities.</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores how different ways of experiencing poverty affect the possibilities of poor children to make the most of their education. The study uses the concept of conditions of educability to reflect how the different dimensions of the experience of poverty facilitate or hinder the success of educational practices and the learning of poor students. In the first part of the article, the concept of conditions of educability is discussed in relation to the notions of capabilities and functionings, and a framework to investigate conditions of educability is presented. The second part of the article is based on the results of a study conducted in Belo Horizonte, the capital of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Through an analysis of interviews conducted with students, families and teachers, the different dimensions of the social experience of the children who inhabit the &amp;quot;favelas&amp;quot; are described. Two cases are presented and discussed as analytical examples of the conditions of educability of poor children. The last section of the article assesses some of the consequences of conditions of educability for the policy debate.</str>

    <str name="description">The 2012 Quebec students' protests against university tuition fees fostered a debate on access to higher education in Quebec, and specifically on the Quebec &amp;quot;educational lag&amp;quot;. Using census data, we show that degree-holding is the same among Quebec French-speaking and Ontario English-speaking populations. Using event history analysis, we show that, during the second half of the twentieth century, university access increased at a different rhythm in each province and, within each province, within socio-linguistic groups. Quebec current education policy should not focus on the &amp;quot;educational lag&amp;quot;, which past policies have helped make up for, but on inequality in university access.</str>

    <str name="description">This article focuses upon perceptions of girls' education in the family context within which decisions around children's education and opportunities are made. The article presents a framework showing how parental attitudes to girls' education are shaped by an objective logic framed by the notion of returns, relating to potential benefits of daughters' education, and respectability, relating to girls' modesty and threats that education may present to normative expectations for girls. Drawing upon data collected in 2011 in rural areas of the districts of Faisalabad (Jaranwala town) and Chiniot (Tehsil Chiniot) in the province of Punjab, the study highlights how assumptions around the liberating effects of education implicit in global education programmes fail to take into account cultural values around gender norms that are central to informing parental attitudes towards their daughters' prospects for education.</str>

    <str name="description">We analyse the utility of social capital for children's achievement, and if this utility interacts with family human capital and the quality of the parent-child relationship. Our focus is on parental activities directly related to children's school work. Our data stem from a Swedish cohort born in 1953 and consist of both survey and register data. We find that parents with more human capital tended to offer their children more social capital. OLS regressions showed that, when present, social capital was directly related to children's grades and its utility for achievement did not depend on parents' human capital. The utility of social capital was enhanced when combined with a very good parent-child relation.</str>

    <str name="title">Turning Collegial Governance on Its Head: Symbolic Violence, Hegemony and the Academic Board</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Rowlands, Julie</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article draws on Bourdieu's theorisation of domination and Gramsci's notions of hegemony within the context of a larger empirical study of Australian university academic governance, and of academic boards (also known as academic senates or faculty senates) in particular. Reporting data that suggest a continued but radically altered form of collegial governance in which hegemony is exercised by management rather than by the professor, it theorises the domination of academic boards within western democratic universities. However, traditional collegial governance is also dependent upon a community of scholars, a role historically played by the academic board. In view of the suggested transition in collegial governance and the resultant convergence of academic work and management, the article concludes with questions about whether academic boards can continue to serve as communities of scholars in future.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores citizenship discourses empirically through upper secondary school student's understandings, as these emerge in and through their everyday experiences. Drawing on a post-structuralist theorisation inspired by the work of Michel Foucault, a discourse analysis of data from interviews with students is carried out. This analysis characterises three discourses of the active citizen--a knowledgeable citizen, a responsive and holistic citizen, and a self-responsible &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; citizen. The analysis raises questions over the implications of contemporary efforts for the intensification of standardising forces through citizenship education. It also stresses the notion that engaging students actively does always also involve discourses other than those stressed through the curriculum, which nurtures the body and nerve of democracy itself.</str>

    <str name="title">Bourdieu's Collective Enterprise of Inculcation: The Moral Socialisation and Ethical Enculturation of Medical Students</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Emmerich, Nathan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper introduces the idea of enculturation to sociology as a compliment to socialisation in the context of Bourdieu's &amp;quot;collective enterprise of inculcation&amp;quot; and social theory. Enculturation is positioned as a concept that can be used to address formal education as a factor in social reproduction. Following a discussion of socialisation and enculturation and their interrelation, they are further examined in the context of medical education. In particular, I focus on the moral and ethical aspects of medical education and the social or professional reproduction of medical students. I differentiate between &amp;quot;medical morality&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ethos&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;medical ethics&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;eidos&amp;quot;, arguing that the reproduction of the former is predominantly a matter of socialisation whilst the reproduction of the latter is a primarily a function of enculturation. Nevertheless I make clear that any eidos is not independent of the ethos in which is exists and that, therefore, any medical ethics is dependent on the socio-cultural institution of medicine and its moral ethos. Utilising the concepts of eidos and enculturation in Bourdieuan social theory facilitates a focus on the neglected cognitive aspects of social life, including explicitly pedagogic activities, and provides for a degree of indeterminacy or &amp;quot;freedom&amp;quot; in a theoretical perspective that has been criticised for its deterministic implications.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Donnelly, Michael</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">A new approach to researching school effects on higher education participation is proposed here, which combines insights from the school effectiveness field of research with sociological theories and concepts of schooling. In doing so, it draws attention to some of the problems with the dominant approach often taken in this area and attempts to offer a more analytically precise way of measuring and explaining school effects on higher education choice. It will be argued that whilst past approaches can make it difficult to decipher school effects, the new approach proposed here provides greater understanding about the extent and nature of the school's influence.</str>

      <str>Gartland, Clare</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Employing students to market higher education (HE) and widen access is established practice in the United Kingdom and other developed countries. In the United Kingdom, student ambassadors are held to be effective in aspiration and attainment-raising work and cited as &amp;quot;role-models&amp;quot; for pupils. The focus of this paper is student ambassador outreach work in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics including medicine) at two contrasting universities. The study deployed ethnography and approaches from across the social sciences to trace and analyse discourses surrounding ambassadors, and to explore their positioning within learning contexts, relationships with pupils and the learning that takes place. Findings indicate that where ambassadors work collaboratively with pupils in contexts with &amp;quot;informal attributes&amp;quot;, pupils can identify closely with them. However, in contexts with more &amp;quot;formal attributes&amp;quot;, differences, not similarities, are highlighted. Stakeholder interests are found to significantly impact on learning contexts and on ambassadors' efficacy as HE &amp;quot;role-models&amp;quot;.</str>

    <str name="description">Although many international students experience transitional issues, most research assumes these issues will disappear over time. Using principles of social capital theory, this study addressed whether after three years of study students were able to build multi-national and host social capital links. In this quantitative study of 81 students from 28 nationalities, the results indicate that Confucian Asian students lived in separate social worlds, while English and other international students developed substantial multi-national networks over time. Learning networks after 14?weeks were predicted by group allocation and initial friendships, indicating a positive effect of mixing multi-national groups.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Brady, Norman</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper is based on a qualitative case study of undergraduate curriculum design and pedagogic practice in the new University Business School (UBS). Data were collected using semi-structured interviews with 24 academics from across a range of business sub-disciplines together with an extensive documentary review of materials relating to two undergraduate degree programmes. The case study found that the UBS curriculum had become recontextualised as a &amp;quot;business project&amp;quot; in which programmes were constructed as &amp;quot;products&amp;quot; for the higher education market. The associated pedagogy was largely confined to behaviourist problem--solution routines based on narrow projections of the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; of business. This paper contends that UBS undergraduate programmes were designed in a generic mode in response to the material and discursive influences of marketisation. As a consequence, &amp;quot;epistemic chaos&amp;quot; had arisen in which knowledge and pedagogy had become fragmented and amorphous.</str>

    <str name="description">Considering data from a research project with two Gypsy communities (2010-2012) in South West England, this article explores issues of education and identity. The two communities have contrasting experiences within the education system. Informed by inter-disciplinary perspectives on identity and assimilation theories, the article explores these experiences within the wider context of the researcher's work with Romani communities over the past two decades, exploring the impact of schooling on cultural identity and group membership. Questions are raised about theories concerning hybrid and multiple identities. Finally, the author emphasizes the need to acknowledge the heterogeneity of minority groups in formulating policy.</str>

    <str name="description">Students studying art at university in the United Kingdom tend to be female, from higher social classes and from majority ethnic groups. This paper considers some of the complex and deeply-rooted social and economic factors that militate against wider participation in the arts and describes how we started to tackle under-representation at Goldsmiths using a participatory action research approach. Working in partnership with local colleges, the project aimed to increase student diversity and widen participation in the Goldsmiths BA Fine Art Degree. The need for university applicants to have the &amp;quot;right sort&amp;quot; of cultural capital is particularly marked in Fine Art, indicating that standard widening participation aspiration-raising activities would not solve the problem. A range of interventions were developed to support potential applicants, underpinned by participatory action research. The flexibility and responsiveness of the research model allowed us to reflect on and respond to issues as they arose and to achieve immediate positive impact.</str>

    <str name="description">Despite entering higher education in good numbers, candidates from some black and minority ethnic groups are concentrated in less prestigious institutions. A similar pattern is evident in candidates' applications, raising important questions about the role of &amp;quot;self-exclusion&amp;quot;. Statistical analysis confirms that candidates from some minority ethnic groups tend to target lower-ranking institutions, but these differences are almost entirely explained by other variables, particularly academic attainment, type of school attended, number of A-levels taken and subject mix. It follows that some minority ethnic groups appear to be indirectly disadvantaged by patterns of schooling that do not prepare candidates for elite higher education. Similar processes are evident in relation to social class, although candidates from less privileged family backgrounds remain less likely to target high-status institutions even when other variables are taken into account.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Latent profile analysis was used to identify different categories of students having different &amp;quot;profiles&amp;quot; using self-reported classroom behaviour. Four categories of students with unique classroom behaviour profiles were identified among secondary school students in Oslo, Norway (n = 1570). Analyses examined how classroom behaviour categories are related to gender and school performance and whether a dual understanding of gender in school is helpful when trying to explain achievement differences as supposed to classroom behaviour categories. Analyses showed that gender was a better predictor of school achievement than classroom behaviour categories, even though the behaviour categories did contribute to the explanation of variance in students' academic marks above and beyond gender.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines gender gaps in academic performance (grades in mathematics and reading) between boys and girls of ninth-grade elementary schools in the Czech Republic. Our analysis is based on 2003 data from the Programme for International Student Assessment, encompassing the academic performance and family background of ninth-grade pupils. Similar to research on other countries, we find that girls strongly outperform boys in grades in Czech language, but that this gender gap is not explained by measured ability in reading nor on family background or student attributes. We also find gender bias in mathematics grades, after controlling for measured ability and other factors. Girls are also substantially more likely than boys to apply to secondary grammar schools, as well as aspire to a college education, even after controlling for measured ability. We put forward a number of theoretical perspectives that shed light on the possible causes of these empirical findings.</str>

      <str>Paek, Kyong-Mi</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Over the past decades, many art advocates have argued for the intrinsic value of learning in the arts. Nevertheless, the arts continue to struggle to find a secure place within the school curriculum. Concerned about the arts' impact on classroom practice, this paper aims to cast light on diverse realities constructed by art teachers as insiders in marginal contexts. This will be done by reviewing a critical cultural inquiry into art education practice in South Korea. Two interpretive analyses of individual teachers' life stories have disclosed the practitioners' relationships to established power dynamics between the dominant practice and a developing alternative practice network within the system. The discussion focuses on the inherent contradictions and opportunities identified within the context of Korean education. This paper provides cultural resources for conscious professional transformation of practitioners and contributes to broader discussions on the socio-educational status of art in education.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Kloot, Bruce Charles</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper provides a history of academic development by examining how a South African institution coped with the potent social forces confronting it before the collapse of apartheid. Theoretically, it draws on the framework of Pierre Bourdieu and engages with a paper written a decade ago by Naidoo, who also used Bourdieu to understand institutional change in South Africa in the late 1980s. Through contrasting the habitus of two professors, it is argued that academic development helps to preserve the autonomy of the university field by refracting forces impinging on it from the economic and political realms.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper provides a critical exposition and analysis of the work of an acclaimed Italian educator, Lorenzo Milani, and ideas that emerged from his experiences in two Tuscan localities. His work is well known in Italy and many parts of southern Europe. Despite the translations of his works into English and Spanish, in the early 1970s, and their use in sociology of education classes in the United Kingdom, he seems to have had a very limited impact on the Anglo-North American-dominated critical education field. The paper revisits his ideas, in this 90th anniversary year, indicating their contemporary relevance and the signposts they provide for a critically and sociologically engaged pedagogy.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines the long-term association of family socioeconomic status (SES), educational, and labor force outcomes in a regional US longitudinal sample (N = 2264). The results offer insights into the mechanisms underlying the role of family SES in transitions from secondary schooling to early work experiences. It was found that the academic achievement gap associated with SES widens during secondary schooling due in part to course-level tracking. Family SES relates to college enrollment mainly via its association with academic gains in school, but also through family income and father's occupational status. Family SES is weakly but significantly related to adult offspring's earnings but more strongly related to occupational status. Educational qualifications and cognitive skills make independent contributions to the explanation of labor force outcomes.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper focuses on one aspect of a qualitative study concerned with investigating the place and meaning of &amp;quot;physical education&amp;quot; to practitioners and children at three preschools in Scotland. We examine the ways in which the participants engaged with discourses related to physical activity and health in order to construct their subjectivities. Fourteen practitioners and 70 children participated. Research methods employed were observations, interviews with adults, a group drawing and discussion activity with children, and interviews with children. Both the adults' and children's talk illustrated the dominance of neoliberal, healthism meanings that position individuals as responsible for their own health. While the children's talk primarily centred on health as a corporeal notion, the practitioners tended to talk about physical activity and health in both corporeal terms and in relation to the self more holistically. The practitioners also talked about physical activity as a means of regulating children's behaviour.</str>

    <str name="description">Based on a qualitative study involving 124 professional and managerial class families in Catalonia (Spain), this paper describes the aims and objectives these families have for the education of their children. During the fieldwork, when asked what they were aiming for in the education of their children, almost all of the parents replied &amp;quot;for them to be happy&amp;quot;. But what kind of happiness are they talking about? What kind of education might lead to happiness? Drawing principally on the work of Kellerhals and Montandon and their &amp;quot;contractual model of education&amp;quot; and Bauman's concepts of &amp;quot;secondary security&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;homo eligens&amp;quot;, although also taking into account the related contributions of Lareau, Vincent and Ball, Stefansen and Aarseth, and Kusserow, the paper aims to demonstrate the strong connection these families make between happiness and &amp;quot;absolute&amp;quot; autonomy, understood as two sides of the same coin and seen, by the participants, as the guiding principle that should shape the way they bring their children up.</str>

    <str name="description">Homework is an increasing yet under-researched part of young children's everyday lives. Framed by the international agendas of starting strong and school accountability, homework in the lives of young children has been either overlooked or considered from the perspective of adults rather than from the perspective of children themselves. This paper redresses this situation by reporting on an Australian study of 120 young children, aged four to eight years, where homework emerges as a key part of their everyday lives. Children's own accounts of their everyday decision-making, using audio-taped conversations and concurrent paper-based timeline activities, show homework as accomplishing the institutional purposes of the school, while affording the children opportunities to demonstrate their competence in operating in an adult-generated education regime.</str>

    <str name="description">While student parents now represent a significant proportion of the higher education population in England, this group has been given limited consideration in policy circles. Using a social constructivist and feminist theoretical framework, this paper draws on a research project investigating the role of higher education policies in supporting student parents in England. It focuses on findings from 40 interviews conducted with student parents enrolled on university programmes. It shows that, in the context of the default construction of the university student as carefree, student parents often describe their experience of navigating academia as a struggle, in which time-related, financial, health and emotional problems prevail. However, the stories they tell also emphasise the benefits associated with their dual status. By doing so, they resist the discourse of deficit typically applied to &amp;quot;non traditional&amp;quot; students and produce a counter-discourse that disturbs the long-lived binary opposition between care and academia.</str>

    <str name="description">This article investigates the relationship between class origin, educational attainment, and the capabilities of agency and voice. The main objectives are to investigate how class origin and educational attainment interact and to consider whether higher education reduces any structural inequalities in the social aspects of life. A longitudinal approach is applied, using a national survey of 1058 Swedish young people, controlling for baseline values of agency and voice. The empirical analysis reveals an association between class origin and agency and voice. University education proves to be of central importance for the capabilities of agency and voice; however, this varied for young people with different class origin. Young people from manual working-class backgrounds benefit from higher education, while no significant result was found for young people with white-collar parents. The results indicate that higher education reduces structural differences in capabilities central for social participation.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article draws attention to the relative lack of theoretically and methodologically elaborated approaches to understand and explain the complex relations between transnationalization of higher education and globalization seen especially from the point of view of global capitalism. The main aim of this article is to contribute to the construction of a theory of transnational academic capitalism (TAC). A theory of TAC argues that those networks, practices and activities that are blurring the boundaries between higher education, markets and states are increasingly becoming transnational without supposing that this transformation implies that local and national levels are insignificant in studying TAC. In this respect, focus is especially on methodological starting points of a theory of TAC. It is argued that a theory of TAC should be based on sociological relationalism and qualified methodological transnationalism.</str>

      <str>Matsuoka, Ryoji</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">While shadow education, organized learning activities outside formal school, has grown greatly around the world, the relationship between formal schooling and shadow education has not been well investigated. This study is therefore intended to empirically test whether formal education's structure (i.e. tracking) affects students' shadow education participation by utilizing a nationally representative dataset consisting of 10th-grade students in Japan. Results of multilevel logistic regression analyses show school socioeconomic compositional and cross-level interaction effects on shadow education participation: students in high-socioeconomic status (SES) schools are more likely to seek shadow education lessons than those in schools of lower SES; and higher SES students tend to take shadow education lessons, especially when in high-SES schools. Additionally, the study finds that the school composition effect becomes relatively weak when extra lessons are free of charge, highlighting the importance of family economic capital to obtain additional learning opportunities.</str>

    <str name="description">Extant research on family migration for education has focused almost exclusively on the education of children. We thus know very little about family migration when it is driven by the educational projects of parents. To begin to redress this gap, this paper explores the experiences of families who have moved to the United Kingdom primarily to enable the mother or father to pursue a degree. It argues that, in common with what we know of UK student-parents, both choices about and experiences of higher education are strongly differentiated by gender.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper asks whether the institutional hierarchies defined by &amp;quot;golden triangle&amp;quot;, other Russell Group, other pre-1992 and post-1992 universities in England, and by ancient, old and new universities in Scotland, have become weaker since the 1990s. Using indicators constructed from Universities and Colleges Admissions Service data for 1996-2010, the article finds a stable hierarchical relationship among the sectors within each country, with some indicators showing a slight widening of status differences between sectors towards the end of the period. The main exception was a slight &amp;quot;upgrading&amp;quot; of new (post-1992) universities in Scotland early in the period. There was little change in the association of institutional sector with social class, but in England the association with private secondary schools became slightly stronger and the association with ethnicity weakened.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Andrew, Yarrow</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Emotions have received increasing attention in educational circles in the last decade. Drawing on Bourdieu, feminist scholars use emotional capital to illustrate the ways gendered inequalities can compound the disadvantages of social class. This paper examines relationships within childcare services in Australia, showing how emotional capital functions as a resource for staff. Data from interviews with childcare staff illustrate key aspects of emotional capital, such as reflexivity, resilience and embodiment. Findings show that investing in emotional capital is the key to a long-lasting commitment to childcare work, and should be valued accordingly.</str>

    <str name="description">In this paper, the authors argue that despite a resurgence of elite studies, the majority of existing scholarship works to reify and legitimize social inequality through its language and method. In particular, the authors utilize Pierre Bourdieu's concept of relational thinking to review and critique contemporary research on elite education and the ways in which such scholarship relies on a stratificationist approach to class analysis. Ultimately, this paper argues that future research on social class, and elite studies in particular, could benefit from using Bourdieu's relational approach as a means to better address the challenges of social inequality.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Traditionally theorists who have written about agency and structure have eschewed empirical research. This article uses the findings of an empirical study into graduate employability to inform the sociological debate on how they relate to each other. The study examined how Dutch and British final-year students approach the labour market right before they graduate. The study revealed that the labour market and education structures are mirrored in how students understand and act within the labour market. It also showed that the interplay between agency and structure is mediated by an intersubjective framework shared by other students. The article argues that previous theoretical views on employability have failed to understand this and suggests how to improve our understanding of agency and structure.</str>

    <str name="description">Social capital is generally considered beneficial for students' school adjustment. This paper argues that social relationships among pupils generate social capital at both the individual and the class levels, and that each has its unique effect on pupils' performance and well-being. The sample in this study consists of 1036 children in 60 first-grade classes in 46 Dutch elementary schools. Multilevel regression results show that a substantial proportion of the variance in school adjustment can be attributed to the class level and that both individual-level and classroom-level social capital have substantial effects on school adjustment. At the individual level, the size of one's network is more important than its structure. At the collective level, social capital also has a &amp;quot;dark side&amp;quot; because it can have negative effects on adjustment, lowering the academic performance in a class.</str>

      <str>Warin, Jo</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article contributes to ongoing discussion of the Bourdieusian concept of cultural capital and current attempts to elaborate this concept and its derivatives. The paper identifies &amp;quot;identity capital&amp;quot;, the capacity to create a narrative of social and self-awareness by constructing a flexible sense of self. This concept explains findings from a longitudinal ethnography with nine children and young people over a 13-year period from pre-school to the age of 17. Analysis of the data shows that this particular capacity is developed through certain kinds of privileged discourses and the opportunities provided within socially advantaged schools and families. Two case studies are selected to reveal how identity capital interacts with other identifiable forms of capital that compound and entrench each other. The paper concludes by arguing that deficiencies in identity capital could be addressed within schooling in order to support the creation of this important resource.</str>

    <str name="description">Robust academic research on the topic of students involved in the sex industry is in its infancy, yet the relationship appears consistent and permanent. This paper draws on findings from the largest study into the stripping industry in the United Kingdom to explore the relationships between students, sex work and consumption. To make sense of the relationship between students and participation in the sex industry, a deeper understanding of other social and cultural processes is needed. In this discussion we argue that the following points are relevant and interlinked: changes to the nature of sexual commerce and sexual consumption as they become part of the marketplace; changes in social attitudes and the rise of &amp;quot;respectability&amp;quot; in sexual commerce; the &amp;quot;pleasure dynamic&amp;quot; amongst students; and changes in the higher education structure that place students as consumers as well as financially fragile. We set out a future research agenda given that this relationship is set to grow as the individual bares the cost of higher education.</str>

    <str name="description">The main objective of this paper is to show to what extent and why students with the same academic aptitude but different social backgrounds have different odds of entering university. For our analysis, we separated primary and secondary factors of social origin in the formation of educational inequalities. The results show that the primary and secondary factors have approximately the same influence on the transition to university. Czech schools do not affect the process of forming educational aspirations and transition to university, and merely &amp;quot;classify&amp;quot; children according to their social origin. This situation emerged during the socialist era and has remained unchanged after the fall of communism (in 1989). However, the mechanism of the social origin effect has changed--while cultural capital with a &amp;quot;direct&amp;quot; impact had a major role to play during the socialist era, at present there is a rather &amp;quot;indirect&amp;quot; influence through economic capital.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Increasing pressure on all levels of educational provision, whether academic or overtly vocational, to be to &amp;quot;relevant&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;useful&amp;quot; prompts consideration of the relation between curriculum and pedagogy in terms of the internal structure of knowledge forms. Following Durkheim&amp;apos;s distinction between &amp;quot;sacred&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;profane&amp;quot; orders of meaning and drawing on the work of Basil Bernstein, this paper questions pedagogic presuppositions that directionality from sensory experience to abstraction posits the everyday life of the student as the foundation for the acquisition of complex, systematic knowledge. Two empirical examples are discussed: one focuses on the internal structure of craft knowledge, while the other focuses on the internal structure of mathematics as school subject. They converge in the finding that transmission of knowledge structure, whether in material or symbolic form, requires the transformation of empirical objects into theoretical objects before a connecting point can be found between the world of everyday experience and specialised knowledge forms. This is what constitutes a &amp;quot;relevant&amp;quot; curriculum.</str>

This article is a theoretical examination of the practice and consequences of a culture-based curriculum that is promoted as the solution. We develop the argument that not only is the &amp;quot;cultural solution&amp;quot; at odds with the complex social reality in New Zealand, but it is itself a contributor to educational under-achievement.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores the layered transitional experiences of a semi-professional athlete named Jack (a pseudonym) between the fields of professional sport and further and higher education. Our analysis is framed by the quadripartite framework of structuration and focuses on Jack's &amp;quot;in-situ&amp;quot; practices at his college and university in order to illustrate how these can operate to reproduce, transform, and challenge the habitual discourses and rituals that circulate within these institutions by generating forms of corporeal empowerment for young athletes who have valued conjunctural knowledge. The findings highlight the fragility of the transition process and raise questions regarding how the experiences of young people are shaped by the relationships between employment and post-16 education. Jack's experiences have implications for both policy and practice within further education and higher education.</str>

    <str name="description">The data for this paper are drawn from a qualitative research project involving a number of alternative education sites in Australia and the United Kingdom. In this paper, we focus only on the motives and teaching philosophies of a sample of teachers who have chosen to work in alternative education sites despite, for some, the prospect of uncertain employment conditions and lower salaries. A thematic approach is used with the data so as to structure participant perspectives on a range of teaching-related issues. We argue that the experiences and perceptions of these teachers provide a starting point for reflection about the impact of many current educational policies that have been shaped or influenced by market-driven neo-liberal paradigms emphasising disciplinary accountabilities for teachers.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Edwards, Gail</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper evaluates the contribution of &amp;quot;social realism&amp;quot; in resolving questions of knowledge and curriculum in the sociology of education. Social realists argue that, in the interests of educational equality, all pupils should have access to &amp;quot;powerful&amp;quot; knowledge produced by specialist intellectual communities. Social realism relies upon a critique of standpoint theory, taking it to be irrealist, relativist and ignorant of the post-empiricist revolution in the philosophy of science. This paper argues however, that social realists fail to appreciate the critical realist response to the post-empiricist revolution and thereby end up critiquing a caricatured version of standpoint theory. The paper concludes that if we are concerned with restoring objectivity, in a manner that avoids both relativism and cultural elitism in school curricula, a turn away from standpoint theory in the sociology of education is not warranted and may be obstructive.</str>

    <str name="description">This article, through looking at mothers&amp;apos; modes of engagement with their children&amp;apos;s education, proposes an integrative analytical approach to the study of the making of mothers, mothering, and motherhood. The article presents and brings into dialogue four different bodies of anthropological and sociological literature: mothering as a form of care work, anthropological work on child-rearing in different cultural settings, sociological studies of the class negotiation of home-school boundaries, and the theoretical and empirical literature on consumption in post-industrial society. Bringing together ideas of care, culture, class, and consumption into one analytical framework is crucial for attending to, in holistic fashion, the complex ways in which mothering, in different social-cultural contexts, is perceived and practiced.</str>

    <str name="description">In this paper we study the effects of power in a bathroom, which is a rarely analysed space in preschools, using empirical examples from a semi-ethnographic study conducted in New South Wales, Australia. We demonstrate that educators' understanding and practices mostly consider their own positioning in discourses and come short in accounting for children's practices in and expressed views on the bathroom. Educators also remain distant from children's bodily experiences. The interplay of the open architectural design of the bathroom space and dominant discourses operating in the preschool constitute some children as &amp;quot;problem bodies&amp;quot; apparently requiring (and justifying) direct intervention. Following this reasoning we argue that the surveillance, regularisation and normalisation in the bathroom is far from total, which leads us to question the adequacy of understanding the bathroom as forming a part of a modern (disciplinary) institution.</str>

    <str name="description">In this paper we offer a unique contribution to understandings of schooling as a site for the production of social class difference. We bring together the rich body of work that has been conducted on middle-class educational identities, with explorations of the centrality of the feminine in representations of class difference from the field of critical girlhood studies. This is done in order to explore how young femininities mediate the representation of class difference in the environment of the private girls' school. Drawing from our two research studies, located in private girls' schools in Australia and the United Kingdom, we argue that the notion of &amp;quot;disgust&amp;quot;, commonly used in recent engagements around class, has only limited purchase in understanding the representation of class difference in these schools. It is the inconsistencies and complexities in how class and class relations are produced that we wish to illuminate.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">The long-standing relationship between social disadvantage and poor educational outcomes continues to preoccupy educational policy-makers, with teachers at the front line of the ongoing struggle. Across the range of equity concerns, gender may be noted as either qualifying disadvantage or compounding it, but the meaning of gender as a simple binary category is rarely challenged. Using data drawn from a study in three disadvantaged urban fringe Australian high schools we argue that the policy-driven gender-as-difference approach can serve to mask educational inequality rather than to challenge it. By demonstrating the ways in which the girls and their teachers respond to, interpret and understand their schooling experience, we suggest the enriched capacity of a relational theory of gender that, while inclusive of earlier theoretical moments and cognisant of progress made, does offer a more coherent and potentially redemptive basis for educational intervention.</str>

    <str name="description">This article focuses on the concerns expressed by three female Muslim educators who are support staff at an English comprehensive school. Consistent with the debates associated with multiculturalism, group rights and feminism, the article illuminates spaces of gender constraint and possibility within the discourses shaping these women's lives and the lives of the Muslim girls they educate. With reference to an initiative at the school designed to support these girls' greater self-determination--an Islamic discussion group--the article highlights the significance of a justice politics that begins with overcoming relations of status subordination rather than on differentiated group identity.</str>

    <str name="title">Theoretical Notes on the Sociological Analysis of School Reform Networks</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Ladwig, James G.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Nearly two decades ago, Ladwig outlined the theoretical and methodological implications of Bourdieu&amp;apos;s concept of the social field for sociological analyses of educational policy and school reform. The current analysis extends this work to consider the sociological import of one of the most ubiquitous forms of educational reform found around the planet: school reform networks. On the one hand, this analysis highlights the extent to which schooling is composed of multiple, co-existing social fields, which offer school reform networks ample leverage points for change. On the other hand, the degree to which reform networks hope to realise their ambitions fundamentally depends on their capacity to leverage the transferability of capitals among those social fields that govern the daily practices of schooling.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Bodovski, Katerina</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This study makes two contributions to the literature. First, it bridges the sociological discussion of social class habitus with psychological notions of adolescents' educational expectations, locus of control, and self-concepts. Second, it empirically examines the relationships between early employed parental practices and expectations and adolescents' dispositions using a recently available wave of data from a nationally representative sample of US students. The findings reveal that students from higher socioeconomic status families had more positive general and area-specific self-concepts, higher educational expectations, higher internal locus of control, and higher academic achievement, and higher parental educational expectations were positively associated with all studied outcomes. The findings provide only partial support for the effects of early parental practices and highlight the role of gender and race/ethnicity in shaping adolescents' habitus.</str>

    <str name="description">The medicalisation of the behaviour of children is a phenomenon that is attracting growing attention, with particular concern about the increased likelihood of children living in disadvantaged contexts receiving a medical diagnosis, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and treatment. This paper reports on a study of professionals involved with children experiencing behavioural problems. The professionals interviewed in this study articulated their own reservations about the medicalisation of children's behaviour and revealed a number of strategies for interrupting the process towards diagnosis. These interruptions, analysed using Deleuze and Guattari's concept of deterriorialisation, took place along linguistic, visual and affective planes and were successful in encouraging teachers and head teachers to see alternatives to the medical route. The findings have implications for existing practice in the response to, and support for, behavioural problems and for teacher education.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper aims to explore and develop a theoretical approach for children's rights research in education formed through an encounter between the sociology of childhood and John Dewey's educational theory. The interest is mainly methodological, in the sense that the primary ambition of the investigation is to suggest a fruitful and useful theoretical base for formulating research problems and undertaking research in children's rights in education. The paper argues that, particularly in educational settings, research into children's rights can and must be attributed to children both as full-status humans in a socio-politically contextual present, and as continually growing and changing, immature and dependent humans. From the theoretical encounter suggested in the paper, the much-used distinction of the child as either &amp;quot;being&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;becoming&amp;quot; can be reconsidered, and another point of departure for the study of children's rights issues in education can be discerned.</str>

    <str name="description">Sex education is a politically contentious issue in many countries, and there are numerous, competing ideologies relating to the most appropriate methods to teach young people about sexual and reproductive health. This paper examines policy and practice in Uganda in light of two contrasting ideologies, namely morally conservative and comprehensive rights-based approaches to sex education. After a brief description of these approaches, findings from a preliminary qualitative study among teachers working in a non-governmental organisation-run secondary school in Uganda are discussed. Teachers' responses are analysed against the background of current Ugandan sex education policies. The paper considers the implications of the conservative morality informing both Ugandan government policy and teachers' implementation of sex education at the focus school. It is argued that, in the light of young Ugandans' attitudes towards and often varied experiences of sexuality, a comprehensive rights-based approach to sex education may be more appropriate in the described setting.</str>

      <str>Shuker, Lucie</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">&amp;quot;Selling yourself&amp;quot; through personal statements and interviews is now a standard practice for university applicants. This article draws on a multi-case-study research project to report on the self-marketing orientations of students within three 16-19 institutions in England. These orientations (active/passive; internal/external; retrospective/prospective; and integrated/segregated) were embedded within and shaped by each site's strategic response to the conditions of the local education market-place. It is argued that the patterns of these orientations across different institutions is related to the resources and support available to students, the educational trajectories that were considered appropriate for them, and the pedagogic identities fostered by the institution as a whole. Where these differentially prepare students to access universities and courses, schools and colleges may be contributing to, rather than challenging, the socially stratifying work of the education system.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines the effects of social capital on the likelihood of dropping out from the compulsory education system (Grades One through Eight) in Turkey. It focuses on the question of whether school-related social capital can provide the means to stay in school in the presence of risk factors such as socioeconomic status, race, or gender that cannot be easily modified. Despite major progress in enrollment rates due to policies enacted in recent years, the overall drop-out rate in compulsory education is close to 15% in Turkey. Data collected from 764 student-mother pairs show that drop-outs are exposed to higher number of social risk factors. We further illustrate that school-related social capital, as measured by quality of in-school teacher-student interactions as well as parental involvement in school, significantly and positively contributes to adolescents' likelihood of staying in school even in the presence of severe social inequalities.</str>

      <str>Newman, Sally</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article is about the educational work of governesses on Australia's remote cattle and sheep stations. These stations occupy vast tracts of land in the outback, and form part of global food supply chains exporting meat to countries around the world. The article explores the nature of governesses' work, the boundaries they negotiate to perform their work, and the spaces and places in which it takes place. The governess occupies a unique position within the occupational and social hierarchy of the station. She lives and works in the same domestic space as the family/employer, unlike other station employees, and is valued for her success in managing the social and spatial dynamics of power both with the students/children and the employer/family. The article focuses on the negotiation of boundaries between domestic/public spaces, paid/unpaid, affective and educational labour involved in governess roles.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    <str name="description">Bourdieu describes capital as the political building blocks of social order that give meaning to social accumulation and consumption. Through a combination of Bourdieu's sociology and critical race theory, this sojourn into Afro-Trinidadian boys' achievement seeks to elucidate an approach to understanding capital as inherently raced. This is premised on an interrogation of Trinidadian society as pigmentocratically structured, where lightness is rewarded with a myriad of social advantages, and darkness denigrated as illegitimate and &amp;quot;other&amp;quot;. The premium placed on lighter skin is manifested interdependently in the forms of social, economic and cultural capital. As such, the operation of capital as politic not only reflects societal structures of power and domination, but importantly also contributes in the maintenance of said structures. The concept of &amp;quot;Racialised facilitative capital&amp;quot; follows as inseparably both facilitator of social status and as racialised process.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper draws on the notions of &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;cold&amp;quot; knowledge in analysing the responses of students to the relevance of different information and sources of such information in university choice. Analysis of questionnaire and focus group data from prospective and first-year undergraduate students provides evidence that many students put most credence on &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; knowledge, from persons in their social grapevine. However, this is supplemented by &amp;quot;warm&amp;quot; knowledge from fleeting acquaintances at university open days. University provided knowledge is often distrusted. We discuss the implications of this given the recent government emphasis in England on the role of information provision in helping students to make informed decisions, including the relevance to the &amp;quot;fair access&amp;quot; agenda.</str>

    <str name="description">Employing a Weberian understanding of the centrality of a strong bureaucracy in the modern nation-state, this article examines the relationship between the state and elite education in France. Through a historical analysis and an examination of two current issues facing education--widening participation and pressures to internationalise--we illustrate how the legitimacy of the administrative and political establishments, as well as the status granted to elite education tracks, has been largely preserved. Furthermore, dominant social classes have actively played a role in this alliance, thereby limiting the circle of eligible individuals who can aspire to future elite positions.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">The educational reproduction of elite masculinity in postcolonial societies has not been properly studied. This is partly because the postcolonial masculinities of non-western elites are accomplished through the cultivation of naturalized practices signifying the body politic of the nation-state. In Singapore, same-sex elite schools of colonial heritage, particularly Christian mission schools, play a central role in cultivating elite masculinity. Focusing on the elite Anglo-Chinese School, I analyze the array of class and racial anxieties displaced by the schooling of imperial white masculinity unto the decolonized field producing a middle-class Chineseness primed for the leadership of men. I also show that the masculinity is being transformed into a cosmopolitan masculinity co-opting maternal femininity, as the elites turn to engage neoliberal globalization. The case of Singapore shows the postcolonial adaptability of elite masculinities formed in the imperial era, achieved through the gender dynamics of resolving ethnic and class contradictions in elite schooling.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores the process of transnational institutional matching between elite institutions in Singapore and Great Britain, and the role of state-sponsored scholarships in enabling this process as political and administrative elites are selected and groomed. Using data gathered from in-depth interviews conducted with Singaporean undergraduates studying at Oxbridge and a dataset of the institutional origins of 580 Singaporean government scholars, the analysis illustrates how students are being matched from two Singaporean junior colleges to Oxbridge and back to the higher strata of the Singaporean Public Service. We show that the educational trajectories of these government scholars need to be addressed in relation to the informational capital acquired in specific elite schools as well as the governing roles these individuals are meant to obtain within the state upon graduation.</str>

    <str name="description">This article draws on ethnographic research that examines the contemporary articulation of class identity in the postcolonial elite school setting of Old College high school in Barbados. From the qualitative data derived from this study, we argue that social class is better conceived as a series of flows, mutations, performances and performatives. We complicate the common-sense notion that class is a stable structure that allows for the categorization of people by providing a nuanced look into the lived experiences of students and alumni at this elite school. We focus on the wearing of uniforms, the use of technological devices, the deployment of language, and student-lead articulations of social class in an increasingly globalized space. Class is defined and (re-)shaped by students' belongings and longings, all of which, too, are, mutable, and can readily mutate in accordance with local and global circumstances of supply and demand.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines how high levels of social-cultural connectedness and academic excellence, inflected by gender and social class, constitute a particular school habitus of &amp;quot;assured optimism&amp;quot; at an elite Scottish girls' school. In Bourdieuian terms, Dalrymple is a &amp;quot;forcing ground&amp;quot; for the &amp;quot;intense cultivation&amp;quot; of a particular privileging habitus. The paper analyses the &amp;quot;institutional&amp;quot; habitus of this particular private girls' school, drawing on headteacher interviews and student survey and focus group data, and relevant documents. The school is currently re-positioning itself to educate girls for global professional futures through the production of a desired habitus and certain spatio-temporalities.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Courtois, Aline</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines how Irish elite schools negotiate change and maintain their legitimacy in times of economic turmoil and rising social inequality. The paper argues that they have not bowed before the demands of democratisation or economic globalisation. Instead they continue to maintain a high level of social closure and control diversity rather than adapt to it. Moral character acts as a principle of distinction and legitimation as these schools pose as the moral vanguards of the nation, in a national context where the economic crisis is commonly blamed on &amp;quot;greed&amp;quot; and moral corruption. Their discourse is based on the defence of a certain social and moral order, somehow at odds with the dominant neoliberal ideology, but consistent with a static view of society and an aristocratic conception of leadership, which their students internalise.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper analyses tendencies that distinguish the internationalisation of education for two class fractions--owners of medium to large businesses and highly qualified university professors and researchers. We identify the importance of cosmopolitan cultural capital, particularly fluency in English, in strengthening the position of both groups and granting them access to an international field of power from which less privileged groups are excluded. Considering the diverging experiences of the two groups compared with Bourdieu's own findings of a high level of ruling-class cultural unity, we argue that these differences are reflective of the greater heterogeneity of the Brazilian ruling class.</str>

    <str name="description">Privileged benefaction in elite schools and the moral dilemmas, contradictions and power politics involved are the focus of this paper. The notion of &amp;quot;the gift&amp;quot; provides our analytical lens. We concentrate on two girls' schools--one in South Africa and one in England. These were both built, in various ways, on the British model of public schooling. These schools pride themselves on their gifting practices. We offer a broad overview of the different local and global manifestations of and justifications for these practices as they occur in these schools and in the transnational organisations of which the schools are members.</str>

    <str name="description">The elite international school is a rich site for sociological inquiry in global times. In this paper, we conceptualize the international school as a transnational space of agonist social class-making given the dynamic positioning of the complement of international school actors. We position international schoolteachers in the middle of these interactions and suggest that the middle position gives much-needed insight into the complex and relational qualities of class-making. To qualify our theorization of middling and social class-making in elite schools, we draw from interviews with Canadian teachers working in international schools in the Global South.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Although we know a great deal about college choice in nations such as the United States, we know considerably less about how college choice operates in settings lacking well-defined hierarchies between higher education institutions. In the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, students from high socio-economic status backgrounds are over-represented in the Ivy League, Oxbridge, and grandes écoles, respectively. In nations without these hierarchies, how do privileged families distinguish between very similar institutions? Using the example of Canada, notable for its relative institutional flatness, I show that privileged families construct their own hierarchies and tap into established hierarchies in other nations. The data come from an ethnographic study of two elite private high schools in Toronto, Canada.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Page, Damien</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article presents findings from a study of heads of construction schools within 14 further education colleges. Moving from a culture of hyper-masculinity, of tough, dirty work, construction lecturers and managers have to renegotiate their identity and work practices to become congruent with the inclusiveness of further education, leaving behind the aggression and discrimination embedded within the discourses and behaviours of the building site. However, they do bring with them desirable organisational masculinities, competitiveness and entrepreneurialism, that are highly valued by the contemporary college. The article presents findings of competitive and entrepreneurial practices in schools of construction and discusses the key role heads of construction play in bringing together multiple masculinities for the benefit of their school and their learners.</str>

    <str name="description">The health of children in affluent economies has become closely tied to the ideal of a normative body weight achieved by monitoring and balancing diet and physical activity. As a result, the education of young people on how to avoid becoming fat begins at an early age through the language and practices of families, the messages embedded in children&amp;apos;s media, and through formal schooling. In this paper we use the concept of biopedagogies to investigate how discourses that connect food, the body and health come together on Internet websites to instruct children on how they should come to know and act on themselves in order to be(come) healthy bio-citizens.</str>

    <str name="title">Counter-Narratives of Educational Excellence: Free Schools, Success, and Community-Based Schooling</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Gerrard, Jessica</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The notion of &amp;quot;competitive excellence&amp;quot; is an enduring cornerstone of UK educational policy. Most recently, expanding and adapting New Labour's Academy project with the introduction of free schools, the Coalition's approach advances and embeds competitive market-based forms of community engagement in education. Responding to this policy paradigm, this paper draws upon history in order to open up the notion of excellence. Through examining alternative practices of achievement and success in histories of community education, I aim to disturb the unquestioned attachment of educational excellence to the ideals of competitive meritocracy. Comparing across two community educational movements--Socialist Sunday Schools (established 1892) and Black Saturday Schools (established 1968)--I explore how achievement and excellence have been mobilised to very different educational aims. In distinct times and circumstances, both of these community initiatives practiced versions of educational achievement that challenged dominant knowledge hierarchies and underlying assumptions of incapability.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article discusses findings from an Economic and Social Research Council-funded study exploring non-disabled children's ideas about disability. This represents the first in-depth sociological investigation of children's ideas about disabled people as members of wider society. Data are presented from focus group discussions with children aged 6-7 and 10-11. The article draws upon William H. Sewell Jr's theorizing of structure and agency and, in particular, employs his concept of &amp;quot;cultural schemas&amp;quot;. The article explores non-disabled children's enactment of various cultural schemas relating to disability and argues that although they are capable of questioning, even transforming, schemas, they are primarily engaged in enacting a series of &amp;quot;hegemonic&amp;quot; schemas that maintain their privileged position as non-disabled people. The article concludes by urging schools and educationalists to do more to encourage non-disabled children to think differently and positively about disabled people.</str>

    <str name="description">The difficulties Traveller pupils experience in school are well documented. Yet those in home educating go unreported. Monk suggests this is because some groups are overlooked; that gypsies and Travellers are often not perceived as home educators. This article highlights how the move to home education is seldom a free choice for Traveller families. Although existing literature suggests this is a consequence of Traveller culture and mobility patterns, this article argues that problems in school drive uptake. Issues of race and ethnicity continue to drive educational inequality and there is an urgent need to redress this is in educational policy and practice.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper explores the notion of a &amp;quot;just imaginary&amp;quot; for social inclusion in higher education. It responds to the current strategy of OECD nations to expand higher education and increase graduate numbers, as a way of securing a competitive advantage in the global knowledge economy. The Australian higher education system provides the case for analysis. Three dilemmas for social inclusion policy in this context are identified: questions of sustainability, aspiration and opportunity. The paper argues that while social inclusion policy has &amp;quot;first-order&amp;quot; effects in higher education, a &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; imaginary is required for more inclusive &amp;quot;second-order&amp;quot; effects to be realized. It concludes that transformation of the current imaginary will require a more robust theorization of relations between social inclusion and higher education, to give new and unifying meaning to existing practices and to generate new ones. Short of this, social inclusion may be little more than just &amp;quot;imaginary.&amp;quot;</str>

Although asymmetrical power relationships dominated the intentional learning communities of their courses, their work was facilitated by collaborative cultures and supportive tutors, and students gained the confidence to construct their own emergent communities of practice for learning. The students attended seven further education colleges in the East Midlands of England. Data were collected by mixed methods within a social constructivist framework from students and their tutors.</str>

    <str name="description">In this paper we examine the factors contributing to gender inequality in secondary schooling in India by critically reviewing the government's secondary education policy. Drawing on the findings of a study in rural Gujarat, we couple this analysis with an examination of the gendered dynamics that restrict girls' ability to fully benefit from the education infrastructure and initiatives that do exist, using Connell's Gender and Power framework. We propose that an extension of the government's current approach to educational reform, focused primarily on expanding infrastructure may aggravate the gender, class and caste asymmetries at secondary level. Fostering an environment that enables vulnerable adolescent girls to benefit from enhanced educational provisions is essential to realizing their rights and the achievement of an equitable system.</str>

    <str name="description">This article uses Chicago public school closings as a case study for the rise of mayoral control and the decline of democratic participation -- two common responses to stiff competition from global markets -- in urban public schools in the United States. In response to the 2013 Chicago decision to close 50 schools and move 30,000 students, this article presents an in-depth look into the history and theory behind the situation. By drawing upon the history of restrictive education and housing policies for African Americans in Chicago and using a &amp;quot;critical spatial perspective,&amp;quot; the authors argue that school closings are highly counterproductive to the fight for the &amp;quot;right to the city.&amp;quot; The authors argue for increased democratic participation for students, parents, and community leaders in urban school systems across the globe.</str>

    <str name="description">When communities fall into decline, disabled people can find themselves alone and invisible in a society of indifferent individuals. Arendt offers an account of such a time in her discussion of the rise of a society of mass labouring and consuming. Bauman's insights into the fragmentation of life, in which established norms, traditional ties and customs fade and solid institutions liquefy, are equally pertinent. Together, Arendt and Bauman point to the conditions and demands that have given rise to the present policy of austerity, current approaches to the education and care of the disabled and the rejection of inclusive education.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines the re-articulation of social justice as equity in schooling policy through national and global testing and data infrastructures. It focuses on the Australian National Assessment Program--Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) and the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). We analyse the discursive reconstitution of social justice as equity in Australian and OECD policy, and analyse NAPLAN and PISA as technologies of governance that re-articulate equity as a measure of performance. These re-articulations are set against the extension of neo-social economistic rationalities to all domains of life and the topological production of new spaces of policy and power.</str>

    <str name="description">The article examines a US public elementary bilingual, multicultural school that attempts to interrupt the reproduction of existing relations of dominance and subordination across a variety of differences. The school's experiences illuminate the complex reality of schools as a site of struggle and compromise between at times contradictory interests, agents, and ideologies and the powerful forces in the (racial) state and civil society that make educating for social equality and justice difficult to accomplish. The article considers the concessions the school has made, and how and why, even in this most antiracist of schools, issues of race and racism persist.</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores Pakistani and Bangladeshi young men's experiences of schooling to examine what inclusion/exclusion means to them. Qualitative research was undertaken with 48 Pakistani and Bangladeshi young men living in areas of the West Midlands, England. The young men highlighted three key areas: the emergence of a schooling regime operating through neo-liberal principles, the recognition of class difference between themselves and teachers, and their awareness of how racialization operated through codes of masculinity. In conclusion, it is argued that research on issues of inclusion/exclusion should be cautious when interpreting new forms of class identity through conventional categories of ethnicity.</str>

    <str name="title">Reconceptualising Learning as a Form of Relational Reflexivity</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Dyke, Martin</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The paper makes a connection between transmission modes and constructivism in sociology and education, respectively. There are parallels between Archer's criticism of upward and downward conflation in social theory, and approaches to learning in education. In her 2012 book, Archer seeks to reconceptualise socialisation as relational reflexivity. This paper seeks to connect this idea to thinking about learning in relational terms and links the analysis to Young's account of &amp;quot;bringing knowledge back in&amp;quot;. The paper uses an example from field work on participation in learning to provide concrete examples that illuminate the points being made. It argues that learning theory needs to move away from transmission and the constructivists' ideas about education and to consider the relational aspects of learning.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">While researchers agree that note passing is predominantly an activity engaged in by girls, there has been relatively little consideration of why this is the case. In this article, I argue that gendered expectations about the appropriate characters of boys and girls in Vietnam are incorporated into the disciplinary framework of schools, and that note passing provides the means for girls to adjust to the gendered disciplinary techniques to which they are subjected. The article is based on extended ethnographic fieldwork conducted within two ninth-grade classes at two lower secondary schools in the northern Vietnamese port city of Haiphong.</str>

We argue, drawing on the Foucauldian literature on governmentality and technologies of the self, that social enterprise-based transitional labour-market programmes can best be understood as neo-liberal technologies of the self that seek to transform persons. In the face of precarious forms of youth labour market participation, the self--the marginalised, unemployed young person--can ill afford to be a smart arse.</str>

    <str name="description">The majority of the still limited literature on education in non-metropolitan areas adopts an understanding of rurality as a fixed and known geographic entity. This paper departs from such a functionalist perspective to explore how rurality is constructed in a programme for at-risk teenagers in remote Australia. Drawing on a range of texts about the programme, including a documentary series entitled &amp;quot;Outback Kids,&amp;quot; we examine how the rural space is imagined as simultaneously therapeutic and disciplining and therefore appropriate for troubled youth. Alongside this discussion we map the way in which other qualities and values associated with bifurcated definitions of the rural as a place of tradition and authenticity, and the urban as a place of disorder and pretence, are engaged in the texts to endorse the programme and its practices.</str>

      <str>Eksner, H. Julia</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores how achievement motivation is framed by the larger context of the devaluation of educational capital that is currently underway in urban centers in Europe. The article elucidates the shared cultural meaning working-class German Turkish youths living in urban marginalized zones in Berlin, Germany create about the decreasing educational and professional opportunities available in their neighborhoods, and the different ways in which they adapt their goals for what to achieve in their lives according to the meaning they make about their circumstances. The article suggests a de-emphasis of ethnocultural group membership in understanding the educational orientations and goals of minoritized youths, and for increased attention to meaning-making processes at the intersection of minoritization, class status, and highly specific ecocultural context conditions. Attention to the new meanings emerging in the local context shifts our understanding of the educational goals and decision-making from paradoxical to rational, congruent, and adaptive.</str>

    <str name="description">Through the lens of post-structural agency, this article focuses on how self-identified smart girls strategically negotiate their academic identities within the gendered terrain of the school. Based on interviews with 51 smart high school girls in Canada, our analysis complicates current narrative of girls' easy achievement in school. Participants discussed balancing the hazards of being overly academic with the rewards of academic success. In response to this tension, girls carefully and consciously performed &amp;quot;smart girlhood&amp;quot;, drawing on resources that are more available to some girls than others, and indicating that girls' academic success is neither easily embraced nor unambivalently accepted.</str>

      <str>Arora, Bela</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The economic downturn has caused governments to reassess levels of resilience and adaptability in the face of new challenges. There has been increased focus on the higher education sector, which has been blamed for developing graduates whose skills do not meet the needs of the economy. The author explores a framework to interpret and understand contemporary policy and practice relating to the employability agenda in UK higher education. The article reflects upon power dynamics driving the creation of more entrenched business-facing universities through the development of the employability agenda and draws upon the work of Antonio Gramsci to provide a theoretical foundation for exploration of the agenda and its rise to prominence. The agenda has, arguably, emerged as an organising principle, which has been framed as common sense.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Morrissey, John</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Universities today inescapably find themselves part of nationally and globally competitive networks that appear firmly inflected by neoliberal concerns of rankings, benchmarking and productivity. This, of course, has in turn led to progressively anticipated and regulated forms of academic subjectivity that many fear are overly econo-centric in design. What I wish to explore in this paper is how, emanating from prevailing neoliberal concepts of individuality and competitiveness, the agency of the contemporary academic is increasingly conditioned via &amp;quot;regimes of performance&amp;quot;, replete with prioritised claims of truth and practices of the normalised self. Drawing upon Michel Foucault's writings on governmentality, and Judith Butler's subsequent work on subjection, I use findings from a series of in-depth interviews with senior university managers at National University of Ireland, Galway to reflect upon the ways in which academics can respond effectively to the ascendant forms of neoliberal governmentality characterising the academy today. I contemplate the key task of articulating broader educational values, and conclude by considering the challenge of enacting alternative academic subjectivities and practices.</str>

    <str name="description">This research examines the understandings and experiences of mono-cultural, mono-lingual local students in relation to intercultural interactions within small group learning activities at university. Bourdieu's concepts of field, habitus and capital are employed to illuminate a number of barriers to intercultural interaction. Using qualitative analysis of interviews with local students, the study revealed intercultural interactions to be co-shaped by multiple co-existing, interdependent and often competing structural and contextual elements, as well as the personal dispositions that students bring to the classroom. The field tends to privilege the capital held by local students (knowledge of small group work, verbal confidence, language), and imposes structural limits on interactions. While students' habitus mediates this effect, the overall result discourages interactions between local students and those from different cultural backgrounds. Implications for universities are discussed.</str>

      <str>Angus, Lawrence</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The launch in Australia of a government website that compares all schools on the basis of student performance in standardized tests illustrates the extent to which neoliberal policies have been entrenched. This paper examines the problematic nature of choosing schools within the powerful political context of neoliberalism. It illustrates how key elements of the neoliberal worldview are normalized in the day-to-day practices of schooling and how certain norms and values that characterize neoliberalism are shaped and reinforced in the education system and also in personal, family and social imaginaries. The task for educational sociology, therefore, is to problematize and 're-imagine' the prevailing neoliberal imaginary.</str>

    <str name="description">Exploring the diverse nature of students' interpretations of their reading experiences, this study moves beyond broad generalizations about boys and girls to consider complexities inherent in the social processes that influence students' engagement in reading. While the study aimed to develop understandings about the ways notions of masculinity are constructed among different groups of boys and the influence of these differences on educational experiences such as reading, the masculine descriptions of some girls' behaviour, or &amp;quot;masculine girls&amp;quot;, was an unexpected finding. Also considered is the unexpected finding that for some boys and girls there were tensions associated with anti-reading peer group cultures. In this paper one particular group of students identified as the Clandestine Readers are discussed. This group of boys and girls personally enjoyed reading although they felt compelled to conceal their endeavours; hence the clandestine factor in the title. The social processes that influenced boys' and girls' engagement with reading are highlighted.</str>

    <str name="description">Since the neoliberal reforms to British education in the 1980s, education debates have been saturated with claims to the efficacy of the market as a mechanism for improving the content and delivery of state education. In recent decades with the expansion and &amp;quot;massification&amp;quot; of higher education, widening participation (WP) has acquired an increasingly important role in redressing the under-representation of certain social groups in universities. Taken together, these trends neatly capture the twin goals of New Labour's programme for education reform: economic competitiveness and social justice. But how do WP professionals negotiate competing demands of social equity and economic incentive? In this paper we explore how the hegemony of neoliberal discourse--of which the student as consumer is possibly the most pervasive--can be usefully disentangled from socially progressive, professional discourses exemplified through the speech and actions of WP practitioners and managers working in British higher education institutions.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Hardy, Ian</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper employs sociological literature on risk and the commodification of education to explain current schooling practices in a context of increased concerns about students' behaviour and results on standardised tests of achievement. Drawing upon teacher and student learning practices in three school sites in south-east Queensland, Australia, the article reveals how specific tests, packages and programmes have been employed as technologies of governance to minimise the risk of adverse student behaviour, maximise student outcomes on standardised tests, and provide teachers with discrete learning experiences construed as improving such outcomes. The sum total of these foci is the construction of education as an increasingly &amp;quot;risky business&amp;quot; which employs a myriad of products and tests to manage perceived and actual risks. The paper also reveals how these products and processes constitute student misbehaviour and inadequate teacher and student learning as &amp;quot;risk objects&amp;quot; requiring constant intervention, but which also inhibit inclusion in schooling settings, and challenge teachers' professionalism.</str>

    <str name="description">Drawing on insights from phenomenological sociology and various strands of socio-cultural theory, this paper reports the findings of a qualitative investigation into critical incidents as formative influences in the research orientation and research cultivation of 22 academics working in research-intensive university education departments. The study first outlines the context in which educational research has taken place, focusing on evidence of tension and conflict associated with differences in epistemological and professional orientation. The research findings indicate two ideal-type categories of educational research professional: the &amp;quot;intellectual-academic&amp;quot;, motivated primarily by the intellectual virtue of research excellence and accountability to the academic community; and the &amp;quot;humanistic-professional,&amp;quot; motivated by service to the wider community. It is concluded that a synergy of both orientations is necessary in producing quality research that is both rigorous and meaningful to a constituency of stakeholders extending beyond the immediate interests of academe.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper draws on qualitative data exploring the experiences of first-generation middle-class Black Caribbean-heritage parents, their own parents, and their children. We focus on the different ways in which race and class intersect in shaping attitudes towards education and subsequent educational practices. We argue that the nature of racism has changed, but it still remains, mainly in more subtle, insidious forms. We conclude that race cannot be simply &amp;quot;added on&amp;quot; to class. Race changes how class works, how it is experienced, and the subjectivities available to individuals. The paper illustrates how the two intersect, in complex ways, in different historical &amp;quot;moments&amp;quot;.</str>

    <str name="description">The global movement of people alters our understandings of social mobility. Here, I draw on ethnographic data collected since January 2011 and utilize the notion of &amp;quot;assemblage&amp;quot; to document and analyze how disparate people, their material objects, and discursive practices are brought together to render refugees as educable, productive, and employable in the United States. I examine the adaptations that result when livelihood paths and educational opportunities become paradoxically diverse due to transnational migrations and are constrained by localized politico-economic environments. My findings complicate the assumption that formal education represents an enduring pathway or necessary precursor to upward social mobility. As refugees are required by resettling agents to become economically self-sufficient as soon as possible, formal education such as English-as-a-second-language courses can limit initial employment opportunities and narrowing families' livelihood strategies upon resettlement, especially during the recent economic downturn.</str>

    <str name="description">This article is a brief personal reflection on the state of research into the relation between education and social mobility. Quantitative methods are both essential and advancing in this field. Sociologists seek scientific solutions but achieve ethical neutrality only with difficulty because all are tempted to bias from social and political background. I commend the political arithmetic tradition but summarise possible sources of distortion in my own biography. Finally I go beyond the boundaries of scientific social science to advocate social policies which might result in a fairer and more equal society.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Sin, I. Lin</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores the perceived role of UK international education as foreign cultural capital, obtained outside the UK, in facilitating middle-class social mobility. Drawing on interviews with students in Malaysia, it extends Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital to explain understandings of the rewards and limitations of undertaking UK education externally. I argue that foreign cultural capital has positive exchange value and an under-researched negative value. I discuss how accumulating local cultural capital is a strategic response to the shortcomings of western knowledge, skills and dispositions. Age, ethnicity, gender and nationality add complexities to the conversion of cultural capital into economic and social advantages. I conclude by arguing for more visibility of external modes of UK international education and the positional possibilities they represent to foreign students seeking distinction within the rapidly expanding global academic marketplace.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Iannelli, Cristina</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper focuses on the role of curricular content on social mobility, an issue largely neglected by social mobility studies. Using data from the National Child Development Study we investigate the extent to which secondary school curricula account for social class differences in the chances of entering into the service class and avoiding a low-skilled occupation. The results show that curriculum matters in the acquisition of different social classes of destination but it matters more for children from advantaged social backgrounds than for children from lower classes of origin. This is because of their higher propensity to choose subjects such as languages, English, mathematics and science, which were found to be highly valued in the labour market. Moreover, net of the effect of origin class and individual ability, all or most of the advantage associated with attendance at selective schools is accounted for by the curriculum studied there.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Reay, Diane</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper problematizes dominant discourses of social mobility. It begins by discussing social mobility from a philosophical perspective before examining current policies on social mobility in the United Kingdom, drawing on data from both recent mobility studies and the contemporary labour market. I then broaden out the discussion by exploring subjective aspects of social mobility, juxtaposing my own personal history with Jackson and Marsden's classic study &amp;quot;Education and the Working Class&amp;quot; in order to exemplify the complexities of mobility journeys. Finally, I argue for better ways of achieving a socially just society, ones that, echoing Tawney, make a case for less distance and greater parity between social classes.</str>

    <str name="description">There has been renewed policy interest in intergenerational social mobility as a route to a fairer society, but in ignoring the sociological evidence this article will argue that the current policy agenda will fail to achieve its goal. Based on an analysis of &amp;quot;social congestion&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;social exclusion&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;social justice&amp;quot;, it also argues that existing sociological research on education and social mobility needs to be extended. In the early decades of the twenty-first century, the experiences of working-class and middle-class students and families are not defined by intergenerational social mobility, but by social congestion and an opportunity trap.</str>

    <str name="description">Drawing upon two ethnographic studies of affluent and elite co-educational secondary schools in the United States, Weis and Cipollone spotlight the explicit &amp;quot;class work&amp;quot; of a now highly insecure middle/upper middle class, as they attempt to maintain advantage via entrance to particularly located post-secondary destinations. Affirming the notion that class position must now be &amp;quot;won&amp;quot; at both the individual and collective level, rather than constituting the &amp;quot;manner to which one is born,&amp;quot; the authors track and theorize intensified preparation for and application to particular kinds of post-secondary destinations in an increasingly segmented national and international marketplace for higher education. Although the US media have taken note of such &amp;quot;application frenzy,&amp;quot; little scholarly work tracks and theorizes this &amp;quot;frenzy&amp;quot; as a distinctly &amp;quot;class process,&amp;quot; one that represents intensified &amp;quot;class work&amp;quot; at one and the same time as class &amp;quot;winners&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;losers&amp;quot; become ever more apparent in the larger global arena.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper uses Raymond Boudon's model of educational expansion to examine the relationship between education and social mobility, paying particular attention to post-compulsory education--an important site of social differentiation in England. The paper shows how Boudon focuses explicitly on the consequences of educational expansion, and argues that his work helps us understand why widening access to post-compulsory education does not necessarily lead to higher rates of social mobility. We investigate Boudon's key theoretical insights and assess the contemporary relevance of his model. The paper argues that the fundamental assumptions of Boudon's model not only remain valid, but have been intensified by systemic changes in English post-compulsory education, and its articulation with the labour market.</str>

    <str name="description">Strategies employed by middle-class families to ensure successful educational outcomes for their children have long been the focus of theoretical and empirical analysis in the United Kingdom and beyond. In austerity England, the issue of middle-class social reproduction through higher education increases in saliency, and students' awareness of how to &amp;quot;play the game&amp;quot; of enhancing their chances to acquire a sought-after graduate position becomes increasingly important. Using data from a longitudinal study of working-class and middle-class undergraduates at Bristol's two universities (the Paired Peers project), we employ Bourdieu's conceptual tools to examine processes of capital mobilisation and acquisition by students to enhance future social positioning. We highlight middle-class advantage over privileged access to valued capitals, and argue that the emphasis on competition, both in terms of educational outcomes and the accrual of capital in the lives of working-class and middle-class students, compounds rather than alleviates social inequalities.</str>

Comparing data from the 1991 British Household Panel Survey and the 2005 General Household Survey, we test these associations for men and women. We find that the relationship between origins and education and origins and destinations has weakened for both sexes. While these findings are supportive of the meritocracy thesis, they are not, however, evidence of a secular trend towards merit-based selection. Contrary to the thesis, we also find the association between education and destinations has weakened for men and women. The relationship between education and destinations is more complicated than is often assumed and the role of meritocratic and non-meritocratic factors in occupational success needs to be better understood.</str>

    <str name="description">In this paper we study to what extent parental field of study affects a person's educational level and field of study. We employ information on 8800 respondents from the Family Survey Dutch Population (1992-2009). Our results first of all show that, over the last five decades, economic fields of study have become more fashionable among men. In sharp contrast, mainly tracks in agriculture have lost most of their appeal. Among women, medical, economic and socio-cultural fields have gained attractiveness. Second, we established that parental field of study is of significant importance for reaching a high level of education for children, and that the relevance of parental field of study is increasing over the years. Moreover, symmetry in fields could be established when it comes to the intergenerational transmission of field of study. Our results support the idea that educational expansion does not necessarily lead to increasing meritocracy in western societies.</str>

    <str name="description">Higher education (HE) is often viewed as a conduit for social mobility through which working-class students can secure improved life-chances. However, the link between HE and social mobility is largely viewed as unproblematic. Little research has explored the possible impact of academic failure (in HE) on the trajectories of working-class students or the ways in which working-class students may re-construct their career aspirations as a result of such academic failure. This paper seeks to fill this apparent gap by focusing on a group of non-traditional students enrolled on a BA undergraduate programme in a post-1992 university. Utilising Bourdieu's notion of habitus, the paper identifies how academic failure contributes to possible trajectory interruptions and whether these are temporary or possibly permanent. It specifically focuses on how working-class students interpret and respond to their academic failure and the possible impact this has on their social mobility.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Drawing on a qualitative case study and deploying Bourdieu's thinking tools, this article attempts to understand rural students' subjectivities and practices in a Chinese elite university, relating the types and volumes of capital they possessed to the process of position-takings. It contextualises their experiences against the backdrop of the rural--urban divide in China and the great educational inequality thus entailed. Rurality in the metropolitan space resulted in a strong feeling of being out of place. Lack of the legitimate cultural forms, together with pervasive financial constraints, constituted a major cause of frustration and alienation for these former academic stars. Exclusion and self-exclusion from the 'consecrated' culture, high-status societies and social activities further handicapped their acquisition of valued capitals. Under such conditions, rural participants produced diversified strategies and practices, through which we catch a glimpse of their evolving habitus.</str>

    <str name="description">This article focuses on questions and attitudes towards higher education in the British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey series. First, we analyse the changing BSA questions (1983-2010) in the context of key policy reports. Our results show that changes in the framing of higher education questions correspond with changes in the macro-discourse of higher education policies. Second, we focus on the 2010 BSA survey responses to investigate how attitudes towards higher education are related to respondents' characteristics. Respondents' socio-economic position predicts attitudes towards higher education. Graduates and professionals are most likely to support a reduction in higher education opportunities, but those who have so far benefitted least from higher education are supportive of expansion. One interpretation -- with potential implications for social mobility -- is that those who have already benefited from higher education are most inclined to pull the ladder up behind them.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    <str name="description">Meritocracy is a powerful ideology that was used by the Chinese Communist Party during China's transition to a market economy. With the &amp;quot;Gaokao&amp;quot; in particular, higher education selection became an ideal vehicle for the Party to associate itself with the ideology of meritocracy. This article investigates the extent to which higher education selection was based on meritocratic principles in contemporary China. A survey study involving around 960 first-year students was conducted in 2007 in two provinces. The statistical analysis did not suggest a strong socio-economic selection. However, a cultural selectivity was indicated in predicting students' &amp;quot;Gaokao&amp;quot; performance as well as their chances of getting into elite universities. Socio-demographic factors appeared to be more significant than socio-economic status in affecting students' higher education opportunities.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Kimura, Maki</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Universities in the United Kingdom have experienced a transformation in the context of the government's initiatives to widen participation and rapid socio-economic changes locally and globally. With more diverse students entering higher education, universities need to consider how they can create an inclusive environment. Indeed, in order to stress their openness and (international) excellence, many universities proclaim their &amp;quot;commitment&amp;quot; to diversity and difference. However, as Sara Ahmed suggests, institutional speech acts, such as a claim to promote equality and diversity, do not go beyond pluralist understandings of diversity and are non-performative. Through the examination of policies and practices concerning issues of equality and diversity in English universities, this article, firstly, considers whether universities are successful in promoting equality amongst different (ethnic) groups. Then, through a case study of a university, it examines how students become raced, classed, gendered, or nationed subjects, while they struggle to form their own agency.</str>

      <str>Morrison, Andrew</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article details the findings of a study into lecturers' perceptions of undergraduate employability. The investigation employed interviews with the staff on a BA (Hons) in Education Studies course at a post-1992 university. The aim was to examine staff beliefs regarding their students' potential employability in the business and finance sectors. The staff believed the degree offered students the opportunity to develop &amp;quot;transferable&amp;quot; skills that could potentially make them employable in business and finance, thus helping the students develop &amp;quot;absolute&amp;quot; employability. However, some interviewees also believed the students may encounter class-based disadvantages in the labour market with the result that aspects of the students' &amp;quot;relative&amp;quot; employability were beyond their capacity to intervene. In light of growing policy pressure upon higher education professionals to &amp;quot;deliver&amp;quot; increasingly employability-driven curricula, it is concluded that further research is needed into staff perceptions of their roles and capacities within this area.</str>

    <str name="description">Based on surveys undertaken by the Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques (France's National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) and by the Direction de l'évaluation de la prospective et de la performance (Directorate of Evaluation, Forecasting and Performance), this article examines the evolution of female student enrollment in scientific streams in secondary and post-secondary education in France over a period of approximately 20 years, from 1985 to 2008. The aim is to study the changes and constants in girls' choices in science and technology education. The results show that girls' choices to study science and technology have undergone clear changes during this period. These changes have been positive at the secondary level, but rather more ambiguous at the post-secondary level. Both an appraisal of positive developments and the persistently low representation of women in scientific fields will be offered.</str>

    <str name="description">This article is part of a project that seeks in part to explore how students understand and use the concept of intelligence. It is based on an ethnographically contextualized study of linguistic events and was conducted in an inner-city upper secondary school in Sweden. The article shows that the concept of intelligence is not spontaneously used by students but is given meaning by them when they are asked, and that this meaning is given in relation to future expectations, hopes, ambitions and the grades and performances in school that are seen as a means to attain them. When doing this the students also appear to describe their education, the demands it places on them and their performances with a sense of irony. Indeed, on closer analysis, irony seems to be an important communicative strategy for these students more generally.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper draws on social capital theory to discuss the way social class plays out in the friendships of teenage students. Based on data from individual interviews and focus groups with 75 students in four London secondary schools, it is suggested that students tend to form friendships with people who belong to the same social-class background as them. Social-class &amp;quot;sameness&amp;quot; is considered to be an element that importantly exemplifies the quality of their friendships, and hence close, inter-class friendships were significantly less common than close, intra-class ones. In addition, class differentials were evident and often reproduced by students, even in the context of the rarer inter-class friendships. This paper concludes that social class is of continuous importance in teenagers' lives and despite some agentic negotiation of class boundaries, as in the case of omnivorousness, students' friendship networks are dynamically informed by class inequalities.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">A priority toward creating &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; citizens has been a feature of curricula reforms in many income-rich nations in recent years. However, the normative, one-size-fits-all conceptions of citizenship often presented within such curricula obscure the significant differences in how some young people experience and express citizenship. This paper reports on research that explored the citizenship perceptions and practices of New Zealand social studies teachers and students from four diverse geographic and socio-economic school communities. Attention was drawn to the scale of their citizenship orientations and participation (local/global). Drawing on Bourdieu's conceptual triad and his species of capital in particular, the author posits that the differences observed between school communities can be usefully explained by a concept of &amp;quot;participatory capital.&amp;quot; The paper concludes with some reflections on the implications for young people who fail to access the &amp;quot;symbolic&amp;quot; global participatory capital associated with much contemporary citizenship education.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper theorises empirical findings from a school in the north of England in order to contribute to theoretical understandings of racial microaggressions, particularly micro-assaults. In so doing, the paper argues that during the teaching of Black History, micro-assaults were articulated as racist humour and stereotyping, to increase tolerance for disparaging Black people and for justifying their unequal treatment. White teachers and their students were complicit in engaging in anti-Black racist humour and stereotyping, but from a Critical Race perspective, the paper argues that Black students' participation is best understood as a coping mechanism for reducing Racial Battle Fatigue (RBF) as a consequence of Mundane Extreme Environmental Stress (MEES).</str>

    <str name="description">Chinese rural students are less privileged than their urban counterparts in accessing Chinese elite universities. Existing studies widely follow a Bourdieusian explanation for this discrepancy in access, focusing on rural parents' capital deficit in their children's education. However, research also shows that Chinese rural parents hold higher educational expectations for their children's education. This study presents the complexity of Chinese rural parents' roles in their children's access to Chinese elite universities, drawing on narratives from a group of rural students and their parents. The findings show that although rural parents' capital deficit constrains their roles in concrete actions, their verbal expression of higher educational expectations acts as a form of motivation contributing to their children's academic success. This article contributes to cross-cultural explanations of parenting through analysing less privileged parents' roles in their children's access to elite universities.</str>

    <str name="description">Studies have highlighted the growing phenomenon of 'concerted cultivation' wherein middle-class parents are enrolling their children into multiple paid-for organised leisure activities as a way of cultivating their skills and reproducing class advantage. In unpacking the class disparities in children's organised leisure participation, researchers have largely overlooked the way race and ethnicity inflect middle-class parents' concerted cultivation strategies. Drawing upon a qualitative study with Greater London-based professional middle-class British Indian parents, this article argues that the time-spaces of concerted cultivation also serve as sites for British Indian children's ethnic and racial socialisation (ERS). Two axes are identified along which racial parenting strategies intersect with concerted cultivation practices in these families: 'cultural (re)production through organised leisure' and '(anti)racism and leisure'. By analysing these processes, we draw out the implications of this interplay between class and race for understanding middle-class parenting and educational strategies in minority ethnic contexts.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Given the lack of studies regarding migrant parents' views towards the education system of their host countries in an era of global movement, this article focuses on the strategies deployed by Latin American migrant parents towards their children's schooling in the Chilean educational field. To understand these strategies in the context of south-south migration, the article is informed by Pierre Bourdieu's theory and a decolonial critical interculturality framework (DeCI). The article concludes that three processes can be distinguished from the point of view of migrant parents regarding their schooling experience, which link to issues around accessing, adjusting and transforming. Additionally, the notion of parents as a source of knowledge emerged strongly among migrant parents as a way of transmitting their cultural capital in the context of migration.</str>

    <str name="description">It is estimated that only approximately 20 percent of adult European Roma have attained higher than primary education. Scholars have identified different potential causes of the unfavourable school outcomes achieved by Roma students. Cultural differences between the (traditional) way of life in Roma families and the values professed by the mainstream society are often blamed for high dropout rates and the low educational attainment of Roma. Yet there is also a group of researchers who disagree with this, and suggest that it is more to do with economic and other differences. Our empirical study is based on a large representative sample of UNDP/WB/EC Regional Roma Survey conducted in twelve European countries. We show that, on average, Roma respondents (in comparison to non-Roma) express remarkably lower levels of educational aspirations for children. However, these differences diminish considerably when controlling for common individual and household characteristics, and again when including culture proxies. Consequently, our study contributes to questioning one of the negative stereotypes about the distinctiveness of Roma and their culture in relation to education.</str>

    <str name="description">Gendered moral rationalities (GMRs) have been proposed as a means of grounding mothers' employment-related choices in the structural, policy, and social support contexts of their maternal routines. This article analyzes a form of GMR that is anchored in the class-ethno-national position of mothers and comprises a manifestation of their maternal responsibility toward their daughters' futures. By focusing on this form of parenting among working-class parents, we are bridging a gap in the scholarship, which has overlooked the salience of the intergenerational transmission of GMRs. Based on the analysis of semistructured interviews with 20 working-class Palestinian mothers living in poverty in Israel, we found that their responsibility for their daughters' future reflects both the struggle to resist early marriage and prioritize education and the struggle to encourage a model of market citizenship. These struggles reshape mothers' own GMRs and their attempts to transmit these values to their daughters.</str>

    <str name="description">Following Bourdieu and Passeron's concept of cultural capital, this article contributes to the study of its transmission within stable fractions of the working classes in France, who are less observed and yet central. On the basis of household monographs and national statistics, this inquiry confirms an overall large aspiration to academic achievement despite the cliché of a parental resignation regarding the academic and professional future of children. This aspiration is notable in academic choices and in homework monitoring. The educational investment of parents from this median section of contemporary working classes -- mothers especially -- can be explained by their modest, albeit not valueless, school capital. The secondary analysis of quantitative data illustrates a new distribution of diplomas among blue- and pink-collar workers. Repeated interviews show how school investments are deeply rooted in the academic and professional experience of those parents who frequently strive to catch up on a 'thwarted education' with continuing training.</str>

    <str name="description">While many school choice studies focus on individual parents' preferences, we simultaneously address the structural context within which families make decisions and the strategies they develop in response. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 24 Black middle-class parents of young children, we demonstrate that they sought well-funded, academically rigorous schools populated by racially diverse middle-class students. Using administrative data, we then show that such schools are exceptionally rare, reflecting the structural realities of US society. To manage the ensuing dilemma, the parents implemented one of two school-selection strategies: 'assiduous rationality', which entailed collecting information to make a maximally informed decision, and 'trusting a close tie', which entailed identifying a network member who had been successful, and following their lead. Regardless of their strategy, the parents exhibited significant institutional mistrust and anxiety. Our results point to the constraint exercised by social structures, which can thwart parental goal realization regardless of class resources.</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores how conceptions of responsible parenting are re-negotiated in present-day Singapore. It discusses how policy changes in the pre-school area have affected parental practices and notions of morally worthy parenting. Pre-school reform promoting children's holistic development and less intensive parenting is part of a wider process of education reform, which has been on-going for the last 20 years. Based on ethnographic fieldwork, we examine how parents and pre-school teachers negotiate these changes in the context of making pre-school children ready for formal schooling. Our main finding is that the changes associated with reform have created a situation, in which well-educated middle-class parents are increasingly insecure when it comes to education. Rather, they are caught off-balance and are struggling hard to figure out which modes of parenting will be counted as responsible and will turn out to be rewarding in terms of their children's educational success and wholesome development.</str>

    <str name="description">Studies have shown the ways in which non-Western middle- and upper-class families are seeking to educate their children in the West. The rationale for this kind of social reproduction strategy is the acquisition of 'valuable' cultural and symbolic capitals which can be advantageous in the graduate job market of both their home country and internationally. Presenting a case study of four middle-class Nigerian fathers, the paper reveals the rationale behind these fathers' decision to opt out of the Nigerian HE sectors. The paper focuses on three Western capitals -- specifically institutional (a Canadian degree), embodied (high proficiency in English language) and symbolic (Canadian citizenship) -- capitals which will position these parents' children advantageously in the future. The paper concludes by presenting an argument that in seeking these Western capitals for their children, these parents become implicated in the Western hegemonic discourse of 'West is best'.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores how nursing education both exemplifies the contradictions of neoliberalism alongside its seemingly all-encompassing influence. We conduct a feminist critical policy analysis to trace the histories of nursing as a feminised vocation located outside the academy, and how this is reflected in recent policy. We then critically explore widening participation and social mobility in relation to nursing education, and demonstrate how a discourse of fairness is used to justify market solutions. The 'special case' of nursing is considered through an analysis of how 'the nurse' as subject is constituted in education policy discourse. Our discussion focuses on the effects of these reforms and demonstrates how historical discourses that centre on women as carers are assimilated into the 'neoliberal social imaginary'. The paper's scope is both local -- the gendered history of nursing education in England -- and global -- the force of neoliberal globalisation in education policy.</str>

    <str name="description">This article provides a critical sociological examination of how Hong Kong youth's relationship towards Chinese identity and China is negotiated vis-a-vis schooling, language policy, and the broader Hong Kong postcolonial condition, and how this mediates these students' aspirational imaginations regarding possibilities of studying and working in mainland China. Through focus group interviews with middle-class senior secondary school students studying in English as medium of instruction (EMI) Hong Kong government schools, we highlight the conflicted relationships students had towards China, which is embedded within historical memory, but complicated by the contrasting values inherent in Hong Kong as a global financial hub and neoliberal node. Despite the school's active policies promoting Chinese cultural identity, deep ambivalences associated with Chinese sociopolitical values affected aspirational capacity. Furthermore, language policy and language acquisition are implicated in the formation of Hong Kong students' spatiotemporal aspirations towards China.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores the practices of division in operation in primary schools in England in response to the pressures of high stakes tests at age 10/11, known as SATs. Using data from interviews with 20 primary headteachers and information from a survey of nearly 300 primary heads, we argue that the organisation of pupils in preparation for SATs involves 1) the use of grouping by 'ability' in sets, despite the increasing evidence of the disadvantages; 2) forms of educational triage, where borderline or 'cusp' children are prioritised, and more complex forms of 'double triage'; and 3) the growth of 'intervention culture' where some children are withdrawn from normal lessons to resolve 'gaps' in their learning. In this article these practices are understood through a Foucauldian lens as micropractices of power which label and categorise pupils within an accountability system that seeks to classify pupils on a norm/Other binary.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper illustrates the influence of a new national assignment system (NSAS) on Chilean middle-class advantage. This system was designed to increase educational equity by changing the previous school admission &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot; that were prejudicial against low-income students. We use Bourdieu's conceptual tools, drawing on concepts of capitals and field, to analyse the influence of the new rules of the game on the value of middle-class capitals. To understand how the new rules shape middle-class families' advantages, we link qualitative and quantitative analyses that empirically explore how families subjectively interpret the policy change and how objectively it shapes their access to desired schools. The qualitative phase shows that middle-class parents experience the NSAS as a risky new scenario. However, quantitative analysis shows the NSAS is associated with only a modest decrease in middle class-advantages. We illustrate the difficulty of transforming marketized educational systems, where previously privileged families react against equity-driven changes.</str>

    <str name="description">Drawing on a multi-sited global ethnography of elite schools, this article explores how these institutions work to produce subjects that will thrive in a globalized world. We examine how despite a similar commitment to global citizenship education and a cosmopolitan orientation across all schools, the intersections between the transnational and national sphere continue to shape the specific futures students are being prepared for. Thus, while all schools understand cosmopolitanism as being acquired by working across difference and having international mobility experiences, the specificities of the national socio-economic contexts and the founding principles of each institution, shapes the kinds of 'leaders' being formed, which in turn differentiates the specific cosmopolitan practices being promoted. Ultimately, these elite institutions are seeking to create an elite class by conferring a cosmopolitan status on their students which will have direct convertibility for the specific futures being envisioned for them.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Rainford, Jon</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Widening participation in higher education is driven by policy that is then enacted by individual practitioners. Practitioners bring with them a wealth of personal and employment experiences which shape their interpretations and enactments. Drawing on 16 in-depth semi structured interviews with practitioners across seven universities in England, a classification is developed in order to conceptualise their orientations to policy enactment. Whilst nationally focused, this study has international resonance especially in marketised higher education systems where policies are similarly enacted. The model developed within the article proposes that personal and professional experience can cause practitioners to orient towards the interests of the institution or the individuals they work with. This orientation can be in compliance with institutional policy or adopt a more transgressive stance. Through deeper theorisation of practitioner positions, we can better understand how to ensure work in this area better serves the individuals whom it is targeted at.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lilliedahl, Jonathan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This study examines parental involvement in urban public schools, focusing on how parents in organised school-centred networks support, navigate, and negotiate from their different social positions. The multiple case study of specialised music programmes provides insights into parent strategies and behaviours in intermediate practices between school-based socialisation and extracurricular activities largely run by the parents associations. The paper draws on data from in-depth focus group interviews with members of parents associations in socially, culturally, and historically different schools. Findings demonstrate that parent approaches to specialised education and their modes of involvement vary according to social class, resources, and school culture. There are class-based differences in parent strategies and the way their collective symbolic capital is used in policy negotiation. However, relationships between a parents association and the school administration are generally regulated by the social and cultural history of a particular school.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines how girls and boys choose their tertiary field of study and how the different factors driving their choices contribute to gender segregation in higher education (GSHE) in France. We present seven theoretical explanations for GSHE, review the relevant literature and discuss their applicability to the French context. Using rich longitudinal data combining administrative sources, students, parents and school head questionnaires, we assess the heuristic value of these explanations. We employ multinomial logit models as well as decomposition techniques for categorical outcome variables. Our results refute explanations arguing that GSHE reflects gender differences in skills or girls' lower career ambitions. We conclude that curricular differentiation and occupational plans are key drivers of GSHE, even when controlling for ability selection into secondary curricula and for parental and teachers' gender-stereotypical influences.</str>

    <str name="description">The use of international curricula by minority diaspora communities poses a paradox for the construction of student identities that juxtaposes ethnonational and global discourses. Positioned in the throes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Armenian School in Jerusalem utilizes a global curriculum while also attempting to sustain collective Armenian identity among its students, who study four languages. This ethnographic case study of the Armenian School analyzes the impact of competing discourses on identity construction. Findings reveal a pervasive ethnonational discourse based upon key ethnosymbols which promotes a powerful sense of belonging to an imagined Armenian transnation. Simultaneously, the international curriculum champions English as a dominant language and prevents the anchoring of Armenian identity within local society. Global discourses associated with the international curriculum, coupled with a lack of attachment to a concrete homeland, tend to orient graduates away from the Jerusalem community and toward opportunities abroad.</str>

    <str name="description">Research has shown that a young person's situation at school, and pupils' relationships with their teachers, have a clear impact on the processes which lead to young people being radicalized. The present study is a retrospective study based on interviews with former neo-Nazis and their teachers at the time when they became involved in neo-Nazi organizations or milieus in Sweden. In order to better understand the logics of pedagogy and what their teachers' decisions to intervene and to confront their extremist beliefs and lifestyles led to, we focus on a particular case study. The results show that teachers' attempts to isolate these students, and thereby contain the &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot;, failed. Confrontations and strategies designed to discipline the students instead led to resistance and stigmatization. Reflecting upon this situation today, both students and teachers agree that these confrontational strategies fueled the radicalization process.</str>

    <str name="title">From Assisted Places to Free Schools: Subsidizing Private Schools for the Northern English Middle Classes</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Gamsu, Sol</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines how the English educational state has consistently acted to support private schooling in areas where fee-paying schools would be otherwise financially unviable. Educational data on private school participation since the 2008 financial crisis reveals the stark regional divides between London and the South-East of England and the rest of the country. This analysis of contemporary trends is framed within a historical understanding of the spatial dualism of the English middle class in relation to education. The paper traces the policy lineages of the spatial logic of state subsidies for elite models of schooling in northern England, noting the continuity between Direct Grant grammar schools, the Assisted Places scheme and the recent conversion of private schools into state-funded academy or free schools. A review of applications from private schools to become free schools highlights, how differentiated local class structures affect the viability of elite education without state support.</str>

    <str name="description">The recent expansion of the overseas education market in China has led to the rise of &amp;quot;Background Promotion Projects&amp;quot; designed to strengthen the applications of elite university aspirants. Based on ethnographic findings of a particular Background Promotion Project, a Chinese high school entrepreneurship competition, this study analyses how international applicants to elite Western universities learn &amp;quot;the art of aspiration&amp;quot; by constructing and performing entrepreneurial subjectivities. Building a link between Arjun Appadurai's concept of &amp;quot;the capacity to aspire&amp;quot; and Elizabeth Currid-Halkett's theory of &amp;quot;the aspirational class&amp;quot;, this study reveals how deepening social stratification in China and the rise of a global meritocracy reinforce each other. Demonstrating how privilege is consolidated and justified through the (re)production of aspirations, this study further contributes to the theorisation of class reproduction and education during a time of post-industrial change and international mobility.</str>

      <str>Evans, Ceryn</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Despite the overwhelming focus on young people who are at either end of the educational or social spectrum in policy and research, vast numbers of young people do not reside at these extremes. Consequently, there have been calls to focus more closely on young people who reside in the 'middle.' This paper considers the utility of the concept of a 'middling' category through examining four selected case studies of young people as they anticipate their transition onto a range of post-18 education, training or employment pathways. It highlights the ways in which intra-class fractional positioning, academic attainment, personal biographies and serendipitous moments intersect and interact to frame young people's decisions about their post-18 pathways. Attention to these multidimensional elements, over a reliance on categories which position young people within sharp social or academic groups, is crucial for fully understanding young people's decisions.</str>

    <str name="description">Drawing on the dramaturgical theory of Erving Goffman, this paper explores undergraduate students' differing experiences of the Cambridge supervision system. Semi-structured interviews with fifteen undergraduate students were analysed to examine the dramaturgical demands of the supervision and students' perceived abilities to meet these. Findings that suggest that female students and those from working-class backgrounds felt less able to deliver credible performances complicate the University's celebratory account of the teaching system. The discussion draws out the relevance of these findings for scholarly literatures addressing student experiences of elite educational institutions, teaching practices in higher education and dramaturgical approaches to the exploration of power.</str>

    <str name="description">Drawing on the code theory of Basil Bernstein, this study set out to examine how primary school teachers operationalize and experience their teaching practice with respect to the weak framing that may underpin teacher-pupil interaction, and how this practice is regulated by certain variables. Questionnaires were completed by 2,238 primary school teachers in China. The findings revealed that the teachers performed weak framing mainly through an invisible pedagogy in interactions with students, which was significantly affected by an interplay between student-based authority, students' linguistic codes and use of textbooks. An elaborated code generates two crucial advantages: it reduces the impact of the constraints of textbooks and traditional pedagogy on student-based teacher authority, and facilitates the teachers in implementing weak framing. Therefore, providing scaffolding resources to underachieving students to assist them in acquiring an elaborated code could be the key to ameliorating the phenomenon of cultural reproduction.</str>

    <str name="description">The present study addresses the question to what extent language skills among students are influenced by the composition of the overall classroom context and the composition of friendship networks within school classes. Furthermore, we ask whether the effects differ between stratified school systems, with a more homogenous student body in school classes, and comprehensive school systems, with a more heterogeneous student body. Focusing only on classroom characteristics, we find positive effects of the socioeconomic and cognitive overall composition of the school class in Germany's selective school system, but not in Sweden's comprehensive system. In contrast, the ethnic composition does not matter significantly in any of the systems, while direct peer interactions, captured with social networks measures targeting friends in a school class, matter slightly more in Sweden's comprehensive school system.</str>

    <str name="description">Transnational distinction is highly relevant in an age when western degree inflation intersects with harsh gender expectations for Chinese women student migrants, a significant group of players in the scene of UK higher education. Drawing on participant observation and interview data and building on existing theories of cultural capital, this article explores how 25 Chinese women students constructed 'transnational distinction'. Through investigating how newly acquired embodied cultural capital during mobility contributed to the construction of distinction, we argue such distinction is manifested through participants' cognisance of field-specific rules. Their understanding of the complex racial/ethnic and class fabrics of the British society impelled them to be creative in constructing their distinction, particularly seeking diverse peer reference groups. This adds to the extant literature through demonstrating that purposeful comparison and connections can be made across home, host and other destinations, in the women students' quest for transnational distinction.</str>

      <str>Paterson, Lindsay</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Denominational secondary schools in Scotland have been an influential means by which Catholics have achieved full social citizenship. Most of the Catholic population of Scotland has its origins in late-nineteenth-century migration from Ireland into low-skilled occupations. Although the church built a system of Catholic primary schools, it could not afford to extend this for secondary education, and so a compromise of 1918 allowed the state to take over the funding and management of almost all Catholic schools while the church retained a role in appointing teaching staff. The resulting public-sector secondary schools provided the Catholic population with unprecedented opportunities. The patterns of social and educational change affecting Catholic schools are studied here using a unique series of surveys of school leavers covering the whole of the second half of the twentieth century.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper focuses on an Australian university short-term study abroad programme in India part-funded by the Australian Government New Colombo Plan -- an initiative that facilitates transformative people-to-people encounters. Our chief interest is extending our reach, through photo diaries and interviews, to understand how participants' experiences are transformative, how their knowledge production practices contribute towards constructions of global citizenship, and where opportunities to shape future participants' learning may exist. We explore decolonial possibilities for short-term study abroad under New Colombo, contextualising our inquiries historically while exploring the concepts of global citizenship and decoloniality -- ideas that provide a framework for analysis. Although short-term ventures are problematic for enabling two-way benefits, we contemplate how such programmes may still offer space for moving toward decoloniality.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines how critical thinking is perceived and transmitted in higher education (HE) classrooms using two Vietnamese undergraduate programmes as case studies. The analysis of semi-structured interviews with teachers, supervisors and institutional leaders from both programmes reveals transmission of critical thinking is impacted upon by power relations from not only outside, in the form of cultural and political ideologies, but also &amp;quot;within&amp;quot; the pedagogic discourse itself. Guided by Bernstein's concepts of the pedagogic device, classification and framing, the discussion centres on how organisational and pedagogic decisions on critical thinking prepare Vietnamese students to think, or not, 'the unthinkable'. While teachers cannot unilaterally alter official curriculum texts to make critical thinking accessible to all students, it is the former's engagement, or not, in the re-organisation of curricular texts, and the use of particular pedagogic practices that can bring about change.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Data infrastructures are suffused with stories of their past, present, and future that govern their use. This article draws on research into 'OneSchool', the state schooling data infrastructure used to manage student data in Queensland, Australia. The political, social, and technical histories of OneSchool's development are shown to govern its current use. In interviews, users from across Queensland's education system shared stories of the ways OneSchool developed to both impede and create problematic truths about students, teachers and systems. The ways in which OneSchool became known as the single point of truth are used to illustrate how the narratives that accompany data infrastructures govern data, those who record the data, and those who are represented within the data. Identifying the governance of stories that travel with data infrastructures facilitates the development of protective and productive data behaviours for educational practitioners globally who are negotiating the discourse of digital educational governance.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Yunus, Reva</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper challenges (inter)national development narratives that propose schooling as a way out of poverty in the global South by interrogating poor children's experience of pedagogic and disciplinary processes in an Indian classroom. It also develops a theoretical framework to interrogate the relationship between urban poverty and classroom processes which attends to wider class and caste relations in the contemporary context of economic liberalism and 'political and social illiberalism'. Drawing upon parent interviews and ethnographic fieldnotes from a classroom in a state school it unpacks the term, 'labour class', used by teachers to refer to pupils' social background. Further, deploying the notion of 'deficit view' it shows how pedagogic practice, physical and verbal aggression experienced by pupils and pupils' struggles to engage with classroom teaching are shaped by realities of deeply stratified schooling, inadequate infrastructure in state schools and the relationship between 'labour class' communities and middle-class teachers.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Drawing on the construct of 'externalisation', this article examines how and why national policy experts use international knowledge in education policymaking. To understand how national policy experts deal with external source of information and expertise, I analysed the bibliographic references in policy documents prepared for an education reform and conducted network-cued interviews with local policy experts in the United States, South Korea, and Norway. The results revealed that national policy actors' utilisation of international knowledge varies across countries in terms of frequency, function, and level of engagement. The national differences suggest that each country has internalised the act of externalisation in the national policy process, reflecting its own policymaking and reform contexts.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Schmaus, Miriam</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Using data from the Millennium Cohort Study, this article contributes to research on disproportionate special needs identification of ethnic and language minority students in England. It addresses the reasons behind such disproportionalities. By considering a comparatively broad set of indicators on students' abilities, behaviours and exposure to risk factors, it examines if these indicators fully account for existing disproportionalities. Remaining discrepancies might hint at teacher bias and discrimination. Results indicate that overrepresentation of minority students within different special needs categories is fully explained by their exposure to risk factors, when a broad set of risk measures is considered. This also holds true for the overrepresentation of Black Caribbean students within the category of social, emotional and mental health difficulties. Underrepresentation, however, remains largely unexplained by students' exposure to risk factors, school-related abilities and behaviours and even tends to increase when this information is considered.</str>

    <str name="description">There is a growing body of scholarship on how students see themselves, and also on how they are conceptualised by other social actors. However, what has been less explored is how students believe they are seen by others, and how this impacts them. Drawing on focus groups with students across Europe -- and particularly plasticine models students made to depict how they felt they were seen by relevant others -- this paper will illustrate how the four most common ways in which students felt they were constructed were as hedonistic and lazy; useless and a burden; clever, hardworking, and successful; and a resource to be exploited. It will argue that such stereotypes had significant material impact on students' lives and how they experienced being a student. Finally, it will analyse how specific national contexts accounted for a range of variations in how students articulated these constructions.</str>

    <str name="description">Young people are encouraged to take responsibility for their educational outcomes by actively engaging in their education (their 'project-of-self'), but many also take responsibility for the care of family members who have serious health concerns (their 'project-of-family'). Drawing on the concepts of responsibilisation and neoliberal governance, and a feminist ethic of care, we aim to better understand how young people with care responsibilities navigate these dual projects. We use national survey data for young Australians aged 13-14 (N = 3,594) to compare boys' and girls' school engagement (projects-of-self) and caregiving for family members with serious health concerns (projects-of-family). Young people with family health concerns report low levels of school engagement. However, caregiving is associated with somewhat increased school engagement for girls, but not for boys. These findings suggest implicit gendered expectations of education systems which are more supportive of girls' than of boys' engagement in projects-of-family.</str>

    <str name="description">School playgrounds are critical arenas wherein children's gender performances unfold, and 'games' of gender subordination or domination transpire. Theoretically predicated on Butlerian and Baradian gender performativity approaches, this qualitative study analyses how children negotiate and perform gender, exploring the material-discursive effects of human and non-human agents (e.g. football, sartorial elements) in their intra-actions with the body. Data were collected through observations and semi-structured interviews with 80 pupils from two Athenian elementary schools. Findings showed that playgrounds were dichotomised into rigid gender zones, and the children reaffirmed their gender allegiances by forming gender-homogeneous playgroups and engaging in diametrical activities. Gender-zone transgressions were frequent, albeit with high social and emotional cost, especially for boys who were uninterested in football and lacked athletic dexterity. Finally, the results highlighted the effects of material-discursive forces in gender identity development and, specifically, how 'successful' masculinity, girly femininity, sissies, and tomboys emerged through the material-discursive intra-actions of playgrounds, bodies, football, and heteronormative discourses.</str>

    <str name="description">The aim of this study is to analyse working-class mothers' narratives of social interactions among parents at their children's schools. A special focus is paid to the emotions that arise in such interactions and their role in the reproduction of class. A narrative analysis of six stories of white, working-class mothers of compulsory school aged children was carried out. The study is set in Iceland, which gives a unique opportunity for classed and gendered analysis of parental communities as the country is at the forefront of gender equality in the world. Additionally, the compulsory school system is still relatively unsegregated. Findings show that the parental communities reproduce the symbolic violence endured by the working-class mothers within the field of education. Accounts of resistance and anger are present in some of the accounts but affective responses such as inferiority and shame are all-encompassing and contribute to the reproduction of class.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lillie, Karen</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">It has been argued that a transnational elite class is emerging, and that elite schools are 'choreographing' this process. This article nuances this developing theoretical framework with empirical data from an economically elite boarding school in Switzerland. It demonstrates that young men and women at this site linked to a global economy whilst refracting geopolitical tensions in their interactions with one another. This draws our attention to the multi-sited understandings that elite young people develop, despite the widespread assumption that in modern globalisation, wealth can break down cultural and juridical borders. This paper thus importantly contributes to an emerging discussion about the possibilities and constraints of transnational class formation at elite schools. In particular, it suggests that different kinds of elite schools may fill different kinds of roles when it comes to such processes.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Mu, Guanglun Michael</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper intends to develop a sociological thinking of child and youth resilience through recourse to Bourdieu. The paper starts by problematising the misconceptualisation that equates resilience with adaptation. It then marks a clear conceptual boundary between the two notions. This is followed by a review of conceptualisations of resilience across different historical times and theoretical schools, discussing the paradigmatic shifts from the individualistic to the ecological framework. To enable an intellectual and innovative engagement with contemporary developments in resilience research, the paper comes to grips with a sociological reconceptualisation of resilience through Bourdieu's field analysis. The crux here is to grapple with resilience to symbolic violence for emancipation from structural constraints -- a thinking largely absent in current resilience work; and to complement the bulk of Bourdieusian research on reproduction by exploring a change-oriented resilience thinking through the work of the famed sociologist.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Jiang, Shanshan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In predominantly white universities in the United States, international students are frequently exposed to racism, xenophobia, and other forms of exclusion. This ethnographic research examines how students from China's Pearl River Delta negotiate a predominantly white Midwestern university in an era of reenergized racism and nationalism. It reveals the persistence of the ideology of whiteness and culture-based exclusion, which not only racialize foreign students of color, but also engage with this student population to perpetuate white supremacy. It also highlights race as a transnational construct, where China's state ideology of anti-Blackness and Han ethnocentrism powerfully push Chinese students to isolate from Black and Asian American communities.</str>

    <str name="description">Lack of access to autism treatment has deepened the disparities for Black children with ASD. Limited resources and lack of advocacy skills in Black families are reasons given for these service gaps but a need to identify mechanisms that support Black families access to treatment for their children have yet to be investigated. This paper explores the forms of cultural capital single Black mothers use to advocate for their children with autism in schools in the US. Using a Thematic Analysis, interviews were coded for several domains of cultural capital found in the literature, including aspirational, familial, social, linguistic, resistant, navigational, motherhood and black cultural capital. Mothers in the study predominately provided examples of resistant and navigational capital. Additionally, mothers were more likely to use their capital to impact services for their child, when schools engaged in family-centered practice.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Kulz, Christy</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Since the late 1970s, Britain has moved from a Keynesian welfare state model toward a mode of governance where economic reasoning replaces politics. Education in England has not escaped this shift from government to governance described as neoliberalism. This shift toward a new governing rationality has taken shape within the English education system since the 1980s through new public management regimes and networked governance; it has accelerated with academies, or schools run outside of local authority oversight. This paper explores how Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs), or chains of academies directed by a centralized Trust Board, takes neoliberalism's governing rationality further as opaque networks of power are consolidated. Through tracing the narratives of MAT CEOs, government officials and union organizers, this paper shows how network governance enables neoliberal rationalities to predominate within MAT structures where authoritarian practices become normalized. Democratic ideals become bumps in the road to market-orientated progress requiring removal from education.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper seeks to further develop and refine a theory of the ways in which artefacts created by humans direct and deflect the attention of groups and individuals as they act in specific institutional settings. It draws on the writings of Basil Bernstein and Lev Vygotsky. These are two bodies of theory that have strengths which, to some extent, address the weaknesses of the other. It is argued that taken together they will provide a strong base for further extension and refinement in order to provide a coherent account which encapsulates the espoused but not yet fully realised ambitions of both theoretical traditions. A sociological focus on the rules which shape the social formation of discursive practice will be brought to bear on those aspects of psychology which argue that cultural artefacts, such as pedagogic discourse, both explicitly and implicitly mediate human thought and action.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Dempster, Edith R.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores the recontextualization of science in the Malawi Standard 6 syllabus for science and technology. It illustrates how relations of power and social control are enacted, using Bernstein's concepts of classification and vertical and horizontal discourse. The syllabus incorporates five 'disciplines': science, technology, health, housecraft and marketing. Integration of science and non-science content weakens inter-disciplinary boundaries. Horizontal discourse is more prevalent than vertical discourse, further weakening access to powerful knowledge inherent in science. Horizontal discourse is particularly evident in housecraft, much of which appears more relevant to future employment than to everyday life in Malawi. Indigenous or local knowledge is validated through its inclusion in the syllabus. The syllabus illustrates Bernstein's concerns about the adverse effects of including horizontal discourse into vertical discourse, thereby limiting opportunities for social mobility. The article ends by questioning the relevance of Bernstein's theory of the pedagogic device for developing countries.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">The undergraduate-academic power dynamic is being reframed in the current university climate. This article questions the research on power relationships within higher education whereby the dynamic is acknowledged without proper consideration. As such, the formation of power relationships remains unexplored and misunderstood. This article advocates a different approach to understanding power relationships within universities, one which seeks to unveil hidden mechanisms through a dialectical theorisation of systemic and constitutive power. It explores the 'traditional' power relationship between the social roles of teachers and learners, which is being reframed through the conflicting dynamics of the consumer-provider power relationship and the partnership power relationship. In this article, I use critical discourse analysis to explore 32 interviews, 12 observations and 12 documents from two post-1992 English universities. What was once considered a stable power dynamic is now under negotiation, creating confusion for undergraduates and academics regarding appropriate behaviour within universities.</str>

    <str name="description">The concerns over school segregation have gained salience in Finland in the last two decades, paralleling the discussions elsewhere in Europe. This article examines from the pupil perspective, how school segregation and school selection are 'lived' in a lower secondary school in the metropolitan area of Helsinki. Using the concept of borderwork, I examine the hierarchies produced by the divide between selective, mixed and non-selective school class groups in pupils' social relationships, and how these hierarchies intersect with social class and racialization. The article is based on interviews of altogether 46 pupils in the 7th and 8th grades (aged 13-15). I argue that school class groupings are a strong organizing principle in pupils' social relationships, and that pupils' borderwork narratives on selective and non-selective school class groups build on and help consolidate the social class-based and racialized differences between the groups.</str>

    <str name="description">The article analyses a new educational development in Poland, that is, free democratic schools, which are grassroots initiatives of parents seeking an alternative to the traditional pedagogies of the public schooling. These schools form a broader network. Based on ethnographic research carried out at eight such schools over five years, the authors discuss the formation of schools, parents' motivations, collective identity constructions, and internal tensions of inclusion and belonging. Regarding the potential impact of the schools on a broader educational sphere, the authors argue that the alternative schooling as an option for parental choice parallel to the expansion of neoliberal policies and new inequalities creates tensions between the notions of democracy and the consumer logic. However, as observed practices suggest, democratic school communities face internal political dynamics intertwined with societal issues and may seek involvement outside their circles. While these communities are constantly being reformulated, the question of exit and voice becomes their permanent feature.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper draws on the literature on network governance and new philanthropy to characterize and explain the increased involvement of non-State actors in education policymaking in the Dominican Republic. The study reveals, first, how network governance has intensified since 2010 through hybrid public-private spaces of agenda setting, second, how these hybrid spaces have given way to the emergence of new philanthropy, which engages directly with the State as part of its efforts to influence policymaking, and, third, that new philanthropy is evolving to include, as well, the generation of profits, both within and beyond the Dominican Republic, through the creation of an affiliated profit-seeking consulting entity. The paper concludes by arguing that future studies should bring the concepts of network governance and new philanthropy into conversation with theoretical approaches that emphasize the underlying political-economic structures within which non-State actors operate.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Beckmann, Janina</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Although women are increasingly entering male-dominated careers, they remain strongly underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) occupations. While previous explanations emphasize the importance of individual preferences or family socialization, less is known about how the school context contributes to these differences. This study aimed to examine the role of the classroom context as a frame of reference for students' career expectations, focusing on comparative and normative reference group effects. Building on gender socialization theory and rational choice models, I investigate whether these contextual effects affect students' occupational expectations in a gender-specific way. Drawing on a large representative sample of secondary school students in Germany, I find that the gender gap in students' occupational expectations is larger in classrooms characterized by a high mathematical confidence and high aspirations toward STEM. In classrooms with a pronounced STEM-related classroom climate, female students less frequently expect to work in a STEM career, while for male students the same classroom climate is associated with higher expectations toward STEM. More generally, this study demonstrates that research on the explanation of gender differences in career expectations profits from incorporating social context effects within schools and classrooms.</str>

    <str name="description">Social reproduction theory names at least two distinct traditions, one of which has a long history in educational research. Social reproduction theory in &amp;quot;education&amp;quot; emerged out of a concern with education's relationship to capitalist inequalities. By contrast, social reproduction &amp;quot;feminism&amp;quot; developed out of feminist interventions regarding the role of women's unpaid care-work in the reproduction of capitalism. In this paper, we suggest that the renewed energy surrounding social reproduction feminism provides an opportunity to revisit social reproduction theorizing in education. We review the fields' histories and ready the ground for an integrated framework. At the heart of this integration is a feminist analysis of reproductive labor in its contradictory relationship to capitalism. Expanding the analysis from the reproduction of capitalist &amp;quot;relations&amp;quot; to the reproduction of &amp;quot;life&amp;quot; under capitalism, this approach avoids the pitfalls of determinism and attends to students' participation and teachers' work in the contested labor of social reproduction.</str>

    <str name="description">The concept of a typical pathway to becoming a student is a pervasive narrative within higher education, with moving away from home to live at university framed as the &amp;quot;traditional student experience&amp;quot;. In response, recent literature has begun to trouble the thinking around student mobilities. Building on this work, this study draws upon semi-structured interviews with students who have moved away from home into university residences in order to surface the multiplicity and diversity of mobilities and transitions. Engaging concepts from posthumanist and poststructuralist theory, we propose a reconceptualisation of students' mobilities and transitions as rhizomatic, and as ongoing becomings. Furthermore, we also surface the materiality of students' experiences, acknowledging the role of the non-human within students' mobilities. As a result, we extend the emerging work attending to more complex depictions of students' mobilities, and examine the implications of acknowledging the heterogeneity, materiality and granularity of students' experiences.</str>

    <str name="description">This article investigates the association between cultural capital and the likelihood of attending an elite university within the Chinese socio-educational context. Drawing on data from the Beijing College Students Panel Survey, we show that: (1) objectified cultural capital is negatively correlated with the likelihood of attending an elite university whereas embodied cultural capital shows a positive effect; (2) both types of cultural capital enhance the proficiencies of extracurricular activities, which, however, are negatively associated with different quantiles of the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) score; (3) learning capabilities can be strengthened by both types of cultural capital, but they cannot guarantee the attendance of an elite university since they only raise the middle and lower quantiles of the NCEE score; and (4) only embodied cultural capital helps one attend an elite university by virtue of the channel of the NCEE exemption.</str>

    <str name="description">This article seeks to contribute to the growing scholarship on elite schooling through an ethnographic study into the distinct micro-practices of the formation and reproduction of privilege taking place within an elite boys' school in England. The article focuses on the significance of the teacher-student hierarchy as a prism through which to view some of the socialisation processes taking place at the school. Ultimately, it shows that the 'flattened' nature of the teacher-student hierarchy results in the students being given the space to learn how to navigate relationships with those in authority without fear or trepidation, thus contributing toward the inculcation of a certain form of embodied privilege or so called 'ease.' Furthermore, it is both the successes as well as the &amp;quot;failures&amp;quot; in the students' attempts to navigate hierarchies that contribute toward the formation and reproduction of privilege in such settings.</str>

    <str name="description">Scholars generally agree that financial deprivation negatively affects students' educational outcomes. However, while absolute levels of resources are important, individuals' perceived relative economic wellbeing also shape their educational outcomes. This article asks whether attending school with peers from comparably richer families is related to adolescents' educational expectations, aspirations, university plans, and university attainment. We test the relative deprivation theory by comparing three different forms of the Yitzhaki Index. Data for this study comes from the Taiwan Youth Project, which consists of two cohorts of adolescents (N = 5098) from 162 middle school classrooms. The results show that relative deprivation in the classroom is negatively related to students' educational expectations, aspirations, and plans to attend university. Yet, relatively deprivation is not associated with higher educational attainment when controlling for absolute measures of family background. These results highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of perceived relative economic disadvantages in shaping student outcomes.</str>

    <str name="description">The relationship between students' entry to higher education and the history or status of the secondary school which they attended is examined using school leavers' surveys in Scotland stretching from the early 1950s to the late 1990s. The surveys are unique in the length of this period, their details of the higher-education institutions and schools which students attended, and their information on school attainment and on socio-economic status and sex. Universities, colleges and schools were classified in terms of their history in order to understand the role of educational institutions during three periods of reform -- the ending of selection to secondary school between the mid-1960s and the late-1970s, and the two waves of expansion of higher education, in the 1960s and in the 1990s. The conclusion is that the distinctive characteristics of particular categories of institution -- their institutional habitus -- can modify inequality.</str>

    <str name="description">VET colleges in China are positioned at the bottom of the educational hierarchy, absorbing the 'left-over' students with 'less desirable' academic records. VET students are stereotyped as 'stupid and lazy' youths suffering considerable prejudice in Chinese society. Drawing on Bourdieu's theoretical insights, this paper investigates the experiences of students in VET colleges and their teachers' perspectives on them. I explore how teachers' stereotyping habitus is practised in VET colleges and how it affects their students' learning experiences. The findings demonstrate that the teachers' pedagogic practices in class impose a designated cultural arbitrary via a hidden curriculum. The students adopted 'passing time' attitudes in class as a response to their teachers' 'misrecognition'. The paper examines how a system of unequal power relations in Chinese VET college is maintained and legitimised, which contributes to the 'transmission' and reproduction of the very culture that has shaped the standing of VET in Chinese society.</str>

    <str name="title">Classroom as Heterotopia: English Lessons as a Space to Problematise War</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Liddle, Anna</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The incorporation of peace and war into the curriculum poses problems to teachers, especially in an examination-focussed school system. Whilst recent research concerning conflict has considered conflict-resolution within schools, and difficulties teachers face teaching about terrorism, little has been written on teaching 21st century war without the high-profile deployment of UK troops. In this article, I examine how peace and war are taught in an English school. After identifying the school's overall war-focussed discourse, I focus on the practices of an ex-services English teacher and his techniques to debate, discuss, and ultimately problematise war creating a space akin to Foucault's heterotopia. I argue this 'other space' allowed him to develop his practice and there is evidence of the heterotopia 'leaking' further afield. I suggest that although there are limitations to the classroom-as-heterotopia, it can nevertheless provide a space for practitioners to disrupt the wider discourse within their schools.</str>

    <str name="description">Drawing on a broader study that focused on understanding rural college students for equity and personal growth in higher education, this paper presents Ying's story of learning and living as a female college student from rural China. Adopting the thinking tools of habitus and reflexivity, the paper aims to understand the constraints Ying has gone through in China's higher education and her various response amidst them. The findings illustrate how the intersectionality of rural dispositions and gender has put her at a disadvantage and how she constantly mediates her surroundings through internal conversations. The paper discusses the intricate interplay between habitus and reflexivity during the mediation. The conclusion affirms the relevance of both habitus and reflexivity in our understanding of the rural student's educational experiences and argues for the role of education and society in challenging the social structure and promoting social change.</str>

    <str name="description">Power relationships between undergraduates and academics are frequently overlooked. This article explores the construction of a 'traditional' power relationship between undergraduates and academics, through the theorisation of systemic and constitutive power and considers the prevalence of this dynamic within a higher education (HE) context. I draw from Fairclough's three-dimensional model of critical discourse analysis to explore 32 interviews, 12 observations and 12 policy documents gathered from two post-1992 universities in England. Academics and undergraduates in this study perceived the existence of a traditional power relationship, constituted through the behavioural expectations of the established social roles of the traditional learner and teacher, which form the dynamic. I will discuss the behavioural expectations and distributed powers of the traditional learner and teacher roles, before addressing the prevalence of the traditional power relationship within the universities in this study and the barrier this creates for more collaborative dynamics.</str>

    <str name="description">Over the last 30 years higher education has seen a rise in new managerialism across all its activity, driven by neoliberal economic policy. Professional doctorates (PDs) have been part of this rise, increasing in number considerably and spawning a related interest in researching doctoral work. However, there have been few studies focused on how students develop an understanding of theory/theorisation and how supervision supports it. This paper reports on a research project involving interviews with supervisors from professional doctorate in education programmes in the UK, as a particular example of PDs in general, to explore the process of theorisation. Drawing on Bernstein, it shows how supervision, and wider programme design, are mediated by the increasingly managerial context of doctoral study. The study raises questions about the ways in which students and supervisors engage with both methodology and theory/theorisation in working together and subsequent implications for the quality of doctoral work.</str>

    <str name="description">Advancing the 'temporal turn' in the sociology of education, this article explores how a strong national discourse on the length of the school day influences pupils' articulations of their temporal experiences. The discourse of 'the long school day' emerged as part of a fierce debate on the implications of a Danish school reform passed in 2014. We use a discourse-analytical framework to examine focus group data from pupils aged 8-12 to show how the discursive context of the reform influences the pupils' articulations of their temporal experiences. The pupils' reproduction of the adult discourse of 'the long school day' conceals a diversity in temporal experiences and reduces them to being a concern about the number of clock hours spent in school. To understand the broader impact of pupils' temporal experiences of their school day, we need to rethink the linearity between clock hours and articulations of time.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Jean-Pierre, Johanne</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">African Nova Scotians constitute the largest multigenerational Black Canadian community, with 400 years of presence in Atlantic Canada. Despite the end of &amp;quot;de jure&amp;quot; school segregation in 1954, African Nova Scotians' social and cultural capital were not incorporated in curricular and pedagogical practices. Using the theoretical framework of cultural trauma, this article draws from a qualitative study conducted using semi-structured interviews and focus groups with sixty participants. A cultural trauma process takes place after a traumatic event and involves a cycle of meaning-making and interpretation that can result in demands for reparation or civic repair. This study illustrates how through the cultural trauma process grounded in their collective memory, African Nova Scotians articulate an aspiration for culturally relevant and sustaining pedagogy as a form of civic repair. This transformative pedagogy would facilitate a reconnection with their heritage and a fulfilment of the democratic goals of public education.</str>

    <str name="title">On Reductions -- Examining a British-Bourdieusian Sociology of Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Winzler, Tim</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In this article I explore a disposition towards a critique of 'reductionism' and 'determinism' that seems to me to be very much prevalent within British sociology. I take a qualitative educational sociology that uses Bourdieusian concepts as one body of research where this disposition is expressed with particular fervour. A close examination of this work reveals its tacit acceptance of the limits of specific, and mostly statistical, classifications. It also reveals a distorted approach to reflexivity and the view of rival approaches and critiques. This points towards a specific and systematic disposition that, through the abundant warnings of 'reductionism' and 'determinism', itself reduces the development of a particular theory to a specific epistemology, thereby endangering the potential of rupture and epistemological break advocated by Bourdieu. This prompts us to pose fresh Bourdieusian questions about the state and practice of Bourdieusian reflexivity.</str>

    <str name="description">Drawing on interviews we explore the centrality of belonging to rural places, embedded within time, in shaping life as a male reader, regardless of country of origin, or generation. Place theory explored the assemblages of spaces important for 6 boys (10-11 year-olds) from Australia and 6 men (25 year-olds and 60 year-olds) from Sweden in their reader identities. Findings illustrate how assemblages of geography, resourcing, relationships with the land, and desires to connect to broader cultural affinity spaces become ingrained for males in rural places and distinguish them from working class males in metropolitan contexts. Classroom experiences related to 'academic reading' became embodied in non-reader identities and shaped life as a reader through the lifespan, while peer group cultures and connections to place offered alternative spaces to engage with reading a range of texts related to cultural life worlds with a shared sense of meaning, purpose, and value.</str>

    <str name="title">Beyond Empowerment: Student Self-Assessment as a Form of Resistance</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Nieminen, Juuso Henrik</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Student self-assessment is commonly promoted as a formative assessment practice that boosts learning and self-regulation. On the other hand, it is suggested that self-assessment fosters students' reflexivity and empowerment. Despite both arguments, student self-assessment plays a rather minor role in modern educational systems that value test results over critical reflection. amidst the neoliberal context of education, self-assessment might even discipline rather than 'empower': the high achieving, self-regulated learner reflects the values of individualisation, competition and marketisation. How could self-assessment be used to resist the prevalent structures of power? In this study, self-assessment, is reconceptualised as a form of resistance. This endeavour is guided by four frameworks for power and resistance: sovereign, epistemological, disciplinary, and biopower. The concept of transformative self-assessment is formulated in order to reframe self-assessment as a socio-political practice. This study considers the role of self-assessment not as a tool to foster performance, but as a disruptive practice that promises to reveal and resist the structures of power in assessment.</str>

P/CVE in education takes various forms; the pilot explored here is considered super-soft in that no mention was made of violent extremism. Attention was given to schools' capacities to enhance social cohesion through Restorative Practices (RP) -- a method for building social capital. We use an affective-discursive lens to explore how affects/emotions are caught in a dispositif of governance fundamental to efforts to regulate youth through this method. Specifically, we focus on extreme emotional incidents that highlight norms and practices in which violence and emotions are entangled, which expose limits and implications of RPs. While holding promise for transcending punitive disciplinary methods, we argue that RPs rely on logics that limit how violence is understood, locating violent problems within the problem bodies of marginalised youth.</str>

    <str name="description">Focusing on the intergenerational educational association alone obscures discussions of downward and upward mobility and immobility patterns, which entail different life experiences and their potential consequences. Utilizing data on Israelis aged 25-32 years old over three periods, the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, during which tertiary education expanded dramatically, we examine if and how relative and absolute intergenerational educational mobility is shaped by educational expansion. Our results on relative mobility replicate findings about persistent inequality in educational opportunity. Persistent inequality, however, entails different mobility patterns for different sub-populations. For Jewish men and for Arabs, it mostly means educational reproduction patterns among non-graduates, while for Ashkenazi-Jews it means reproduction among the graduates. Likewise, whereas Mizrahi-Jews and Arabs have experienced mostly upward mobility, Ashkenazi-Jews have experienced an increase in downward mobility over time. Scholars and policy-makers should pay more attention to absolute mobility, as it can shape attitudes and behaviours.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">A growing number of families around the world are relying on student loans to pay for university under recent cost-sharing policies. However, it remains unclear to what extent university costs and the likelihood of needing student loans affect decisions in the early stages of education. This article examines the influence of parents' attitudes towards taking out student loans and anticipated economic burdens for attending university on high school choice, using a longitudinal survey of students and their mothers conducted in Japan. This article shows that students whose mothers anticipate a large financial burden and are averse to taking out student loans are more likely to attend vocational high school than those whose mothers do not so anticipate and are willing to borrow. Furthermore, lower-class families show greater sensitivity to these perceived material barriers in upper secondary school choices than higher-class families when navigating a highly privatised educational system.</str>

    <str name="description">Current reforms in vocational education and training (VET) are characterised by a constant striving for quality assurance and improvement. To this end, a powerful reform network has emerged that shapes the subjectivation processes of teachers. Drawing on Foucault (1980), we term this complex formation a 'dispositive'. The paper introduces &amp;quot;dispositive analytics&amp;quot; as an innovative approach for educational research. Taking Austria as an example of a 'broader understanding' of VET (Avis 2014) we address the question of how VET teachers' subjectivity is shaped by the quality dispositive. The study investigates subject positions that refer to the ways teachers should be and act. Furthermore, qualitative interviews with VET teachers were conducted to examine which dispositional quality logics they tend to internalise and which forms and strategies they express to subvert the quality dispositive. The analysis reveals that the current reform network creates tensions in the subjectivation processes leading to experiences of de-professionalisation.</str>

    <str name="description">This study explores the lived experiences on campus of five female undergraduate students of colour. Drawing on a critical race theory perspective and inspired by CRiT walking, walking interviews were conducted to give voice to the students' experiences of marginalisation, both metaphorical and physical. The findings reveal how whiteness impacts on participants' negotiation of university spaces; how the 'white gaze' influences their geographies; and how their experiences lead them to occupy counter-spaces within the university. Further, we found that participants' aspirations of postgraduate education were tainted by these negative experiences at the undergraduate level, leading them to reject altogether or begrudgingly continue their education. The study proposes theoretically framed walking interviews as a productive methodology in future critical studies of race in education and highlights the urgent need to address the marginalisation of female students of colour on campus as one means of addressing postgraduate recruitment imbalances.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper seeks to contribute to the understanding of the 'panopticon' in educational research, problematising its validity and offering a fresh conceptualisation of teacher surveillance. The school as a 'panopticon' is a well-established concept which helpfully enables a consideration of aspects of high-stakes accountability. The present paper explores the question of how contemporary teachers perceive themselves to be subject to scrutiny and the consequences of this surveillance. It is argued that whilst the panopticon (and its variants) remain very valid notions for understanding performativity in contemporary schools, that a complementary metaphor can be offered which enables a fuller consideration of the 'unseen' behaviours induced by a high accountability environment.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores the entanglement of humanism and posthumanism within the Western European University, focusing on ethical implications and the role of the university in protecting the marginalised. To illustrate its arguments, it draws on a small study conducted in an ancient Italian university which specialises in Humanities and Social Sciences. The paper focuses on two key knotty issues: relationships between university aspirations to posthumanism and the colonial legacies of humanism, and the implications of holding on to humanism as a guarantor of human rights for marginalised people. It concludes by discussing the limitations of a posthuman ethics of responsibility and proposes instead a posthuman ethics of rights for the university.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Simmons, Ben</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">There is on-going debate about whether mainstream education is desirable for children with profound and multiple learning difficulties (PMLD). Whilst some hold that 'inclusion' is a human right, and that interaction with mainstream peers leads to socio-cognitive gains, others argue that profoundly disabled learners require developmental curricular provided by special schools. Despite such claims, there is little evidence to support either view. This paper contributes to the debate by presenting research that examined how mainstream schools and special schools, across nursery, primary, and secondary settings, provided alternative social spaces for children with PMLD. It applies a Lefebvrian lens to illuminate how social engagement depended on the extent to which prescribed practices ('abstract spaces') dominated the interaction ('spatial practices'), and the conditions which allowed novel forms of engagement to emerge ('lived spaces'). Novel forms of engagement correlated with positive social development. The conclusion challenges the 'mainstream-special' binary presupposed in inclusion debates.</str>

    <str name="description">Over the past few years, the civics curriculum for Israeli high-schools has become the centre of a heated political debate. Following this debate, in May 2016 a revised official textbook was introduced. This paper draws on an in-depth analysis of the revised official textbook, comparing it to the previous official textbook published in 2000. The analysis focuses on the discursive changes that took place regarding the ways in which the revised textbook conceptualises Israeli citizenship. A particular focus is placed on how the revised version of the official textbook often prioritises the ethno-national model of the nation state over and above the commitment to democratic values, including minority rights. The main argument of this paper is that these changes are a reflection of the penetration of a neo-Zionist discourse into the civics curriculum.</str>

      <str>McGuire, Kim</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">International scholars have argued that parental engagement in education is influenced by social class inequalities. Goffman's definition of stigma has been applied to interpret working-class mothers' experiences of stigma when attempting to engage in their children's education. However, this paper also draws on recent extensions of 'stigma' -- by considering how and by whom the concept is developed in practice. Selective case studies have been used to illustrate how some working-class mothers feel judged negatively by teachers and the school system, based on their marginalised (and sometimes multiple) social identities. Perceptions of stigma were recalled by parents, who felt this negatively impacted upon their engagement in their children's education. They expressed feelings of powerlessness and in some cases internalisation of stigmatised traits. Recommendations to inform engagement strategies for schools to enable a more inclusive educational experience are made and areas for future research identified.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Brown, Steve</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores connections between language and the social inclusion of immigrants. It analyses three different models of immigration settlement: assimilation, integration through social capital, and inclusion. It then explores how education - and in particular the teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) - can promote values and develop capacities in immigrant learners that either restrict or promote their ability to flourish as active, included members of society. I present these concepts on a continuum, as a framework that can be applied to analyse the role of ESOL in the settlement of immigrants. This continuum is then applied to the ESOL context in Scotland and reveals that, despite the emancipatory language in Scottish government policy discourse, the impact of ESOL provision is largely limited to the empowerment of individual learners and has little impact on addressing structural inequalities or injustices.</str>

    <str name="description">Despite proliferating attention within the social sciences toward the sources and consequences of climate change and environmental crises, educational sociologists have been slow to confront ecological questions. This omission may seem surprising given the prominence of global perspectives within the field. However, we argue, such a focus is emblematic of the discipline's sociocentrism and anthropocentrism. Against such a reified sense of the field's conceptual and analytic purview, this paper reads ecology into educational sociology, with the aim of theorizing a 'geo-logic' basis for future scholarship. If critical sociology of education is to maintain its relevance in the Anthropocene, the discipline must attend to ecological problematics. Building on three recent contributions to socio-ecological thought, we explain the necessity of an ecological attunement in critical sociology of education. To serve this call, we offer a theoretical revision of key disciplinary commitments, clearing new pathways for educational sociologists to do this crucial work.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article pinpoints the mathematic performance gaps among high-socioeconomic background (SES) students from different racial groups in the United States. By doing so, it sheds light on how racial and socioeconomic privilege intersects thus creating different educational outcomes among high-SES children. In short, it illuminates who are the truly advantaged in the American educational system. Taken together, the results suggest that there are substantial racial performance gaps among high-SES children. First, white and Asian privileged children outperform their black and Hispanic counterparts. Second, black high-SES children appear to be the least advantaged among the privileged, and their mathematic performance lags over two years behind that of whites and Asians. What is more, low-SES Asians and whites are more likely to be high achievers than high-SES blacks are. Finally, Hispanics appear to perform better than their black counterparts, nonetheless, they lag about one year behind their Asian and white high-SES peers.</str>

    <str name="title">School Socioeconomic-Background Effects Are Generally Small: A Response to Sciffer, Perry, and Mcconney</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Marks, Gary N.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Recently in this journal, Sciffer, Perry, and McConney (2020) argued that school socioeconomic-background (SES) compositional effects are important for both research and policy. In response, this commentary argues that realistic school SES effects can only be identified in properly specified models. Otherwise, the estimated school effects are very likely to be spurious due to the correlation between school SES and important, but omitted, individual-level influences, most notably prior achievement. In properly specified models with reliable student-level measures, school SES effects are either small or very small. This commentary includes an empirical demonstration of moderate school SES effects becoming small or very small with appropriate controls.</str>

    <str name="description">In a recent article in this journal, Sciffer, Perry, and McConney identify the risk of relying on insufficient within-unit variation as a serious flaw in a number of studies using student fixed effects regression to identify the effects of school socioeconomic composition (school SES) on academic achievement, including one by Armor, Marks, and Malatinszky. In this comment, we revisit our estimates in light of this potential risk, and we demonstrate that within-student variation in school SES in the three settings studied was substantial and sufficient for the use of student fixed effects regression. In further sensitivity analyses, we find that the original results, as well as their levels of precision, are robust to the exclusion of students moving between schools, who Sciffer et al. suggest to be the unreliable major source of longitudinal variation in school SES.</str>

    <str name="description">Universities in the UK, and in other countries like Australia and the USA, have responded to the operational and financial challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic by prioritising institutional solvency and enforcing changes to the work practices and profiles of their staff. For academics, an adjustment to institutional life under COVID-19 has been dramatic and resulted in the overwhelming majority making a transition to prolonged remote-working. Many have endured significant work intensification; others have lost -- or may soon lose -- their jobs. The impact of the pandemic appears transformational and for the most part negative. This article reports the experiences of 1099 UK academics specific to the corporate response of institutional leadership to the COVID-19 crisis. We find articulated a story of universities in the grip of 'pandemia' and COVID-19 emboldening processes and protagonists of neoliberal governmentality and market reform that pay little heed to considerations of human health and well-being.</str>

    <str name="description">Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's analysis of the competition for economic, social and cultural capitals within educational fields, this article reports empirical research from 49 in-depth interviews with graduate students at four elite universities in the USA and the UK. It argues the brands of elite global universities work to reproduce social and cultural capital for a small cohort of elite students, and by doing so perpetuate and reinforce systems that privilege a select few. By drawing upon student narratives, our findings demonstrate the cosmopolitan nature of elite university brands. These 'Cosmopolitan Brands' are immersed in local and highly exclusive practices which reinforce wider inequalities of social class. We explore how individual students navigate their immersion and positioning within the brands of global elite universities; competing first as students at university before progressing to compete for power and status within global economies.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Tweed, Brian</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article discusses a research project in which curriculum mathematics education in an Indigenous Maori school in Aotearoa/New Zealand was conceptualised as a site of struggle. A bricolage of concepts from the sociology of education and Maori knowledge was used to interpret ethnographic data from this school. Findings suggest that struggle derives from two conflicting ontological commitments about the nature of a person. Curriculum mathematics education carried with it a commitment to the person as a collection of official knowledge and associated interactional modes. The ethos of the school carried a commitment to the person as genealogically embedded unique being. Centring Maori ontological commitments. knowledge and people as the source of legitimation suggests the possibility that such schools could use Indigenous ontologies and their associated epistemologies to generate their own terms of engagement with, and Indigenous knowledge of, the discipline of mathematics itself.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper discusses Romani mentors' mixed experiences, views and coping practices in an intra-ethnic 'natural mentoring' project targeting young Romani (more commonly known as 'Gypsy') students in Spain. The intervention transforms already existing intra-ethnic bonds into mentorships in local Spanish Romani communities. To meet the aims of this research, observations were conducted at mentors' follow-up meetings and other project activities, and individual semi-structured interviews were held with three female and three male mentors. The mentors' mixed views and experiences are analysed in four dimensions: competence, commitment, project operation and sociocultural change. From a critical stance, the results suggest that mentoring remains highly apolitical, having as its primary object 'people to be developed' and not the structure that is to do the developing. In this endeavour, mentoring is instrumentalized to create self-regulated 'active' citizens desiring to be acted upon through 'technologies of the self'.</str>

    <str name="description">In this article we analyse what happens to career counselling when it is intertwined with the asylum process. A Swedish example is an amendment to the education legislation, regarding residence permits for upper secondary level students. Following the resulting changes in juridical, educational and interpersonal conditions, career counsellors must deliver 'high-stakes counselling' that can profoundly affect individuals' prospects of asylum or deportation. Our analysis is based on ethnographically inspired fieldwork, a survey and Bernsteinian theory. In current Swedish conditions, tight matching to demands of the labour market is essential in this 'high-stakes counselling'. We conclude that a consequence is institutional introduction of conditional citizenship of asylum-seeking students. This allows countries to select migrants through education, which severely conflicts not only with counselling ideals, but also democratic and equality values regarding possibilities to make choices for the future, thus creating ethical dilemmas for counsellors.</str>

    <str name="description">We respond to Malatinszky and Armor's, and Marks' comments on our article recently published in this journal. We agree with Marks in the use of prior achievement to control for spurious effects in school effects research. Marks makes an incorrect statement about our article, refers to dated critiques, and presents an empirical demonstration with some problems. We agree with Malatinszky and Armor that school composition may have sufficient within-student variation to detect a potential effect on achievement growth in fixed-effects models. We argue that fixed-effects models exclude most of the variation in socioeconomic composition, are incapable of measuring the commonly defined conceptualisation of school composition and can mischaracterise the relative importance of socioeconomic composition.</str>

    <str name="description">The gradual restructuring of the political economy of Turkey after the 1980s has changed the positioning of the middle class and the importance of its social, economic, and cultural capitals. In particular, lowering the quality of public education through systematic privatization and Islamisation has constituted a significant threat to this class' reproduction capacity. Drawing on three years of longitudinal qualitative data from parents in Istanbul, we show that this class experiences a reproduction crisis and follows a two-step strategy for ensuring their children's social mobility: capturing public schools with a middle-class school-mix and transforming them into private-school-like spaces through intense engagement.</str>

    <str name="description">The sociological literature on elite private schooling is frequently informed by Bourdieu's signature concepts of cultural, social and symbolic capital. Yet, his insistence that economic capital is the 'root' of these other capitals is often overlooked or downplayed. This paper addresses this lacuna. While it gestures to Bourdieu's other capitals, its primary focus is on finance itself and the various legal and accounting regimes that facilitate schools' financial capital acquisition, accumulation and conversion into other individual and organisational capitals. We interrogate these schools' income-generating and spending strategies on fees, infrastructure and scholarships, explicating how charity law, tax regimes, and accounting rules work to their advantage. In so doing we demonstrate how ambiguous law and accounting regimes enable them to produce exclusivity through pricing and luxury infrastructure. In short, we show how elite private schools in England keep fees high, scholarships low and luxury pervasive.</str>

    <str name="description">Bourdieu argued that class-based inequalities influenced educational outcomes and this paper illustrates the relevance of Bourdieu's concepts in understanding one specific community. A wider study by the authors used the concept of habitus to identify factors which impacted on the participants--predominantly white working-class mothers'--perceptions of their engagement with schools. This paper provides two selected case study examples from the wider study which describes the ways these mothers interpret different habitus in relation to education and discusses how habitus can inform understandings of different parental perceptions towards education and how this affects engagement. Schools can use this insight to ensure that parents from such backgrounds feel better able to engage with their children's education. Schools use this insight to inform to ensure that parents from such backgrounds feel able to engage with their children's education, both at home and in school.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article discusses how three other articles have employed E.P. Thompson's concept of the moral economy to analyse movements of resistance to higher education (HE) marketisation processes. Two of the studies relate to the English HE sector while one is a study of the Israeli system. The articles were selected because they are indicative of one of the key challenges that scholars working within the sociology of higher education may encounter when applying Thompson's ideas: rendering a faithful sense of the temporality which is foundational to Thompson's concept, and which makes it such a powerful tool of critique regarding dominant hegemonic processes such as higher education marketisation. I conclude the article with a discussion of the challenges that arise in transferring a concept that originated in history to the sociology of higher education.</str>

    <str name="description">This article analyses gender inequalities in educational attainment in the Czech Republic from the novel perspective of multiple educational pathways, which are primary channels of study involving at least two educational transitions (secondary and tertiary) with qualitatively different tracks. We estimate gender gaps in the attainment of six major educational pathways in the Czech Republic across 9 five-year birth cohorts covering the full span of the communist period and the educational expansion of the post-communist period. Our results confirm that gender gaps have increased in recent cohorts, but that these gaps have remained relatively modest in size. The greatest gaps occur in educational pathways involving secondary grammar schools, while gaps involving other tracks of secondary education remain very small. These results suggest that gender gaps in educational attainment in the Czech Republic expose strong gender differences in attendance at secondary grammar schools, in the direction of girls.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article reports findings from a small-scale research project which explored the professional identities of early career teachers working in primary academies in England. During interviews and focus groups, these new teachers resisted identifying as 'academy teachers,' constructing academy status as an unimportant feature when deciding where to work. I theorise this phenomenon using Foucault, arguing that the willingness of new teachers to construct academy schools as 'no different' to their maintained counterparts is a key factor in the success of post-2010 academisation as a biopolitical project.</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores the effects of charter schools on teachers' working conditions in Bogota (Colombia). By employing a semi-experimental approach involving Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and Difference-in-Differences (DID), we find that in the close vicinity (postcode area) of where they are established, charter schools more than double teachers' workload for a comparatively small increase in salaries. In light of a neo-institutional approach, we argue that those advocating for the diversification of school types in Colombia have decoupled the presumed benefits of charter schools' competition from their actual negative effects for teachers. Moreover, we also point out that despite charter schools in Colombia (Bogota) having a not-for-profit status, existing labour flexibilisation policies have exerted isomorphic pressures on them, forcing them to adopt short-term contracts and thus leading to ravaging competition practices among teachers. Overall, we contend that the introduction of charter schools in Colombia (Bogota) has led to a general precarisation of teachers' working conditions.</str>

      <str>Sumroy, Asha Lyons</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The debate regarding the ability of co-operativism to challenge the consequences of neoliberal policy reform in UK schooling remains concerned with the organisation and policy of co-operative academies. This article follows school research which applies a Foucauldian approach to power to explore and identify violently unequal consequences of neoliberal reform. In considering the interaction of co-operativism and neoliberalism in the experience of students at a Co-operative Academies Trust school, through semi-structured interviews with vignettes, it shows co-operativism being exploited to shape neoliberal governmentality. Whilst participants draw on their co-operative schooling to challenge notions of meritocracy and success, co-operativism is ultimately instrumental in the infliction of symbolic violence, as students self-govern towards racialised, classed and gendered ideals. Applying a Foucauldian lens and centring the experience of students are thus vital to the evaluation of co-operativism in schooling.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Burgess, Nuala</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Much of the research examining students' university choosing in England focuses on rates of access to 'elite' universities for high-attaining state-educated students. By contrast, the experiences of students applying to 'new' universities remain under-researched. This paper considers moderately attaining 16-18 years olds as a &amp;quot;discrete group&amp;quot; and highlights how a combination of England's Higher Education (HE) policy and school performance measures may influence levels of support for students' university applications. Drawing on an ethnographic study of a London state school, it finds that support for students' university applications was differentiated in ways which overwhelmingly disadvantaged moderate attainers. A competitive school market, combined with a policy focus on 'fair access' to 'elite' institutions, meant high attainers' university applications were consistently prioritised. Some teachers were found who navigated dominant HE discourses, drawing on an ethical teacher habitus and their social and cultural capital to support students applying to less prestigious universities.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Kwok, Henry</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article addresses the paradoxical nature of 'pedagogic governance', developed from Bernstein's 'pedagogic device', that is, the use of pedagogic means (including knowledge) to govern entire populations in a 'totally pedagogised society'. While knowledge structures have received extensive coverage, not much attention has been given to the tensions between/within the distribution and evaluation of curricular knowledge. Through Derrida, I elaborate on the nature of distributive rules, theorising why a weakly framed curriculum is always open to transgression, that is, the 'potential discursive gap'. However, the subversive power of knowledge is hamstrung by the evaluative rules through high-stakes public assessment and legal-juridical regulations, over which the state is attempting to wield greater influence. Constant struggles between distributive and evaluative powers entail the paradox of pedagogic (mis)governance. To illustrate my argument, this article draws on the politics of curriculum reform in postcolonial Hong Kong as an example.</str>

    <str name="description">The utilisation of non-formal educational methods has long been advocated as a means of supporting marginalised young people. For many in this cohort, the adverse social circumstances that confront them can limit their sense of hope and leave them susceptible to educational under-achievement and/or engagement in anti-social behaviour. Research indicates that sport can act as an effective back-drop for the promotion of non-formal educational programmes especially in relation to marginalised youth. However, there is contention over the role that such programmes play in providing a foundation for enhanced aspirational goals and social integration. Drawing upon research conducted on one UK-based sporting intervention, this paper explores how project engagement enabled participants to enhance their sense of hope, especially around education, training and employment. In so doing the paper demonstrates how the pedagogical approach adopted by project staff, drew parallels with critical education, and nurtured an increased sense of hope amongst participants.</str>

    <str name="description">Undergraduate students at Cambridge come disproportionately from independent schools, high participation neighbourhoods and high socio-economic groups (SEGs). This article examines the process of designing a foundation year (FY) for Cambridge aimed at promoting SEG diversity. The transformative potential of Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, capitals and field are explored to frame the curriculum development process. Working in an intercollegiate group and drawing on international pedagogical research, we first embarked on mapping the architecture of a FY, then analysed potential students' responses to the initiative. Our survey of 304 students suggests that those from low SEGs &amp;quot;might&amp;quot; be encouraged to apply by a FY. They also preferred a discipline-based, not thematic, approach to developing students' academic capital. However, financial costs and concerns about 'fitting in' constituted barriers for many students. We suggest field and pedagogical transformations that are necessary to promote SEG diversity at Cambridge, rather than a FY alone.</str>

    <str name="description">Internships have become an important means to enhance career prospects in an increasingly congested graduate labour market. This article used positional conflict theory to explore how university students from different social class backgrounds experience internships, and the implications for inequalities in post-graduation employment. One-hundred interviews were conducted with final-year undergraduates from three different class fractions at a Russell Group university (n = 50) and a Post-1992 university (n = 50) in England. This research design enabled the exploration of differences between the most socio-economically privileged students and others, independent of university attended. The findings demonstrated how upper-middle-class students at both universities were better able to mobilise family resources to progressively 'stack' multiple and 'high-status' internships, resultantly pulling away from their peers in preparing for the graduate labour market. It is argued that internships have emerged as a class strategy to 'get ahead' beyond the well-established mechanisms of elite universities and prestigious fields of study.</str>

    <str name="description">Research on international students' post-study plans centres on factors influencing migration and career decisions. However, few studies have considered the impacts of individual institutions on students' aspirations and their subsequent transitions after graduation. In this paper, I employ the notion of institutional habitus in order to explore the extent to which higher education institutions expand or limit the range of options that international students could envisage or realise. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 55 non-EU international postgraduate students from three different UK universities, this study aims to uncover the complex diversity that underpins ostensibly similar UK higher education degrees. Notwithstanding the overlapping influences of individual, family, friends and institution, I argue that individual institutions play a significant role in shaping the ways in which participants imagine and experience the field of possibilities after graduation. This perspective also enables a more detailed examination of differences between and within the institutions.</str>

    <str name="description">There is a problematic but widespread perception that we do mathematics with our minds, and sport and Physical Education (PE) with our bodies. Strong identification with sport and PE could therefore pose a barrier to mathematics learning. I explore this troubling possibility using data from a mixed-methods study of 450 Year Nine students (age 13-14) in three New Zealand schools. The most socially privileged students often described mathematical and sporting success as entirely compatible, although most described mathematics as valuable for their working futures and sport as enjoyable but inconsequential. In contrast, working-class and ethnic minority boys often identified strongly with 'physical' masculinity and viewed physical strength and sporting prowess as pathways to paid work. Such students tended not to identify as mathematically capable. This mechanism for exclusion from mathematical success is particularly concerning in nations such as New Zealand where sport is so dominant in school-age boys' imagined futures.</str>

    <str name="description">In the process of neoliberal globalization, the number of pre-college-aged educational migrants from English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) countries, often referred to as an early study abroad (ESA) student, has dramatically increased over recent decades in many English-speaking countries. Much of previous research on these educational migrants has primarily focused on parents' perspectives and involvement, and ignoring the engagement of and investment made by ESA students themselves. By analyzing transcripts of qualitative interviews with fifteen former early study-abroad students from Korea, this paper investigates how these ESA students narrate their experiences of early study abroad and how they understand their roles and experiences in the process. Findings of this paper show that ESA students' ways of thinking and approaches to their educational trajectory and language learning strongly resonate with a practice of neoliberal responsibilization, by which each student is made responsible for her own choices and their consequences.</str>

    <str name="description">The ethnic minorities in China follow two major linguistic educational systems. They receive an education and write the college entrance exam in either Chinese or their own ethnic language. However, the existing literature views the expansion of Chinese education to the ethnic regions of China in recent decades as a forcible process of cultural and linguistic assimilation, so that Chinese-educated minority students become more sinicized (Han Chinese) and their own ethnic identity is eroded and eventually lost. This study examines this alleged assimilation process based on interviews with 30 Chinese-educated ethnic minority young people, including the Mongols, Tibetans, and Uighurs. Our study shows that the Chinese education process conditions the manners, skills and life goals of minority young people that facilitate them to access mainstream Chinese society. Nevertheless, they still retain ethnic ties through family life and many of them show a strong interest in their own ethnic culture.</str>

      <str>Diamond, Aurel H.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper investigates patterns of social reproduction of science education outcomes for high school students in Israel, specifically by examining the relationship between one aspect of science capital -- as measured by having a scientist in the family -- and SES with three measures of science education success: interest in science; science self-efficacy; and aspirations to pursue science at university. Regression analyses of questionnaire data (N = 380) from 14- to 18-year-old high school students yield differences between Jewish (majority) and Arab-Palestinian (minority) students. Specifically, regarding aspirations for university science, having a scientist in the family and higher SES are positively associated with better outcomes for Jewish students only. The analyses highlight the potential advantages of employing theories of social reproduction and science capital to explore inequalities in science education, which in this case is used to identify additional challenges in increasing minority student uptake in postsecondary science.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper argues that the sociology of education would benefit from greater integration with social scientific research focused on morality. This body of research offers a rich set of resources that can illuminate and extend many of the sociology of education's intellectual concerns. In support of this argument, the paper draws on data from Millennium Cohort Study in the UK to empirically examine how a wide range of socio-demographic characteristics are related to young people's moral attitudes. The analysis focuses on the extent to which adolescents state that a range of actions are wrong. In doing so, the paper makes an important contribution to studying the moral lives of young people.</str>

    <str name="description">The article explores 5th and 6th grade pupils' reflections on why pupils may refrain from intervening in bullying, despite understanding that bullying is wrong. The findings are based on focus group interviews conducted with 74 Swedish school pupils, who were asked for their perspectives on the various participant roles depicted in a bullying vignette. The findings were analysed using methods from constructivist grounded theory and through the theoretical lens of Goffman's concept of social stigma. The interviewees emphasised the implications of being positioned as the 'victim', including being socially stigmatised, isolated, denigrated and further bullied, and suggested that the fear of being 'singled out' would be a main concern for pupils, and hence the driving force behind why they may refrain from intervening in defence of a victimised peer. The study thus highlights the associated processes of social stigmatisation and the non-intervention of pupils in school bullying situations.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Critical, and in particular Bourdieusian, sociology of education is often suspicious about educators when they describe their ideal students. It tends to see these descriptions as euphemisations, so that apparently intellectual assessments are really elitist evaluations about students' class positions. However, this way of thinking about educators can lead to reductive accounts in which actors are completely blind to the real meaning of their beliefs, which must be unveiled by sociologists. In this article I utilise Luc Boltanski's pragmatic sociology to offer an alternative model of educators' accounts, in which there is no real meaning to be unveiled, but rather a complex mix of meanings held in educators' minds at once. Analysing interview data with those teaching on new liberal arts degrees in English universities, I demonstrate what can be gained by staying with the complexity of participants' own accounts, rather than mining them for one fundamental truth.</str>

    <str name="description">We examine how organizational actors use global legal, humanitarian, and development discourses in their work supporting educational services for refugees to better understand how the transfer of ideas and norms emanating within global organizations affects educational programming for refugees. We ask: (1) To what extent do organizations reference global legal, humanitarian, and development documents in their work? And, (2) How do linkages with United Nations (UN) organizations (namely UNHCR, UNESCO, and UNICEF) influence organizations' usage of global documents? We find that different organizations draw on global discourses depending on their level of embeddedness in global society and that diverse types of relationships with UN agencies--financial and normative--mediate the extent to which they reference global policy documents.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This project explores whether the embodied cultural capital of non-white students is institutionally recognised in majority non-white schools and colleges by staff leaders at various levels. It does this through a postcolonial lens and Bourdieu's sociology. Cultural capital is the linguistic, artistic, religious, and historic heritage and knowledge of non-white students. The study explored the extent to which this embodied cultural capital is empowered and legitimised as symbolic capital by staff leaders in order for it to become part of the mainstream institutional ethos and cultural pedagogy of the two secondary schools and one sixth-form college involved in this project. This study looked at how staff leaders understand, recognise, articulate and interact with diverse cultural capital. It will conclude by applying Bourdieu's concept of 'the symbolic negation of distance' to the research sites as a way of explaining how cultural inequalities can be reproduced.</str>

    <str name="title">The Role of Capital in the Field of Initial Teacher Education in England</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Worton, Sarah</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The recruitment crisis for teachers in England has led to policy reforms which have significantly deregulated the sector, introduced market mechanisms to mimic aspects of the private sector and set providers in competition with one another. Leaders in Initial Teacher Education (ITE), from both schools and universities in England, were interviewed to understand their experiences of working in this policy context. Responses are analysed to reveal an emerging hierarchy in ITE provision. The research uses Bourdieu's theoretical and methodological frame to make sense of the current field of ITE and conceptualises the providers as 'agents' working in the field who use capital to improve their position in the market. Teacher recruitment remains in crisis, and findings suggest that current reforms, rather than solving recruitment problems, are creating complex and unequal playing fields for both providers and applicants, which may be contributing to the continued crisis.</str>

    <str name="title">Recognition of Boys as Readers through a Social Justice Lens</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Scholes, Laura</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper considers whether societal changes are making space for some working-class boys to go against the grain and foster positive reader identities. Drawing on interviews with 30 Australian boys about their experiences at school, Nancy Fraser's social justice framework is used to explore their parity of participation as readers. Responses raise questions about the need for recognition of boys as readers across demographics and more equitable redistribution of reading resources to the most economically marginalised educational contexts. Boys' narratives also challenge homogeneous images of boy/girl reading preferences that are often represented in literacy policies. The article explores nuances in how working-class boys conceive of themselves as readers within their local communities amidst global shifts in the post-industrial era. It also positions Fraser's social justice framework as a transferable lens for situated analysis that educators interested in enhancing parity of participation for marginalised students can draw upon.</str>

    <str name="title">Taking Religions Seriously in the Sociology of Education: Going beyond the Secular Paradigm</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Grace, Gerald</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Valuable developments in the Sociology of Education over the last 40 years have involved the widening and deepening of analytical perspectives to include not only class-based research in education but also the complex interactions of class, race and gender in all educational, social, economic and political contexts. From a sociology of knowledge perspective the field has become historically more mature and multi-­dimensional in its research and analysis of socio-educational contexts internationally. This paper argues that despite these progressive developments, one dimension is still largely ignored i.e. that of the religions of the world and of the social and cultural implications of these faiths for education today. Sociological analysis which elides a religious dimension not only presents an over-simplified view of social relations in the modern West but also fails to make an authentic engagement with education.</str>

    <str name="description">In this paper we begin to explore how knowledges being generated in bioscience might be brought into productive articulation with the Sociology of Education, considering the potential for emerging transdisciplinary, 'biosocial' approaches to enable new ways of researching and understanding pressing educational issues. In this paper, as in our current research, we take learning as our focus. Our work brings together collaborators from across fields: sociology of education; molecular biology and biochemistry; cognitive neuroscience; fMRI imaging; and EEG. Through the paper we explore the generative potential of an encounter between life sciences and sociology of education. Through consideration of the conceptual and methodological elements of our 'Synchrony in Learning' research and engagement with our pilot experimental approach, our research is suggesting that our central concept, learning, is undergoing metamorphosis, challenging us to understand learning as a phenomenon produced through the intra-action of a multiplicity of forces and processes.</str>

    <str name="description">In this essay we develop the concept of 'cosmopolitan nationalism', offering a working definition and suggesting ways sociologists of education might draw on it in their future work. We show how it is a useful analytical lens through which to examine contemporary policies and practices that navigate global processes (ranking systems, mobility of people, expectations for futures) but also take account of nationalistic tendencies, as well as local and national attempts to challenge persistent inequalities within education systems. By using policy examples from three countries (South Korea, Israel and the US), we illuminate how cosmopolitan nationalism is evident across various initiatives in these countries, and the varied implications this has for education systems in terms of equality, access and quality.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Ball, Stephen J.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper considers the sociology of education (SOE) as a modern human science. It suggests that the SOE is mired in a set of unreflexive, redemptive, Enlightment rationalities, and explores the messy relationships of the sociology with education that result from this. It is argues that the sociology of education has consistently failed to distance itself from the metaphysics, optimism and oppressions of modern schooling. That it has failed to call into question either the basic building blocks of schooling, or what we call education -- pedagogy, curriculum and assessment -- or the buildings themselves, the spaces of education. The paper concludes by asserting to need for critique rather than simply criticism as a starting point for thinking education differently.</str>

    <str name="description">In 2007, we argued that, when it comes to sociology of education, the lives and education of refugee children were invisible. Sociology of education was 'a wasteland' as far as studies of the social effects of migration were concerned. Here, we revisit this argument exploring whether education and migration has been developed into a viable specialism in the discipline, and whether one of the great societal challenges of our age is being addressed. Examining the work published on migration and education since 2005 in BJSE, we see that the majority of studies focus on the global mobility of students and on school experiences of migrant children. While these are valuable foci, what is missing is a more extensive consideration of how 'the age of migration' and the characteristics of global migration in the 21st century challenge the values, the policies and practices associated with state education institutions and social order.</str>

    <str name="title">Sociology of Education: A Personal Reflection on Politics, Power and Pragmatism</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Reay, Diane</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper attempts to work on a number of different levels. Firstly, it comprises my personal reflections on a career in sociology of education. These reflections are entwined with a history of the discipline that emphasises themes of power, politics and pragmatism. This subjective, and inevitably partial, account is combined with an examination of the structure and composition of the academic field of sociology of education and its relationship with the two disciplines it originates from, sociology and education, but also with the wider field of politics. The ways in which these different strands within sociology of education coalesce or diverge, and the consequences in terms of tensions, fissures and struggles within the field will be considered. I also discuss the subject and content of sociology of education, and its future possibilities for radical as opposed to reactionary or reformist agendas.</str>

    <str name="title">Anomalous Beasts and the Sociology of Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Delamont, Sara</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The author reflects on continuities and changes in the subdiscipline, using Mary Douglas and Basil Bernstein. In 2000 the millennial issue of &amp;quot;Sociology,&amp;quot; the generic journal of the British Sociological Association, included a paper about the sociology of education called 'The anomalous beasts: Hooligans and the sociology of education'. It focused on hooligans as anomalous beasts in the sociology of education, and the sub-discipline as an anomalous beast within the discipline of sociology itself. It concluded with, very poor, predictions about the likely state of sociology of education and UK sociology in 2025. The fortieth anniversary of &amp;quot;BJSE&amp;quot; is a good time to revisit that millennial evaluation in order to offer a new sociologically informed re-evaluation of the field in 2020, set an agenda to highlight some of the current weaknesses in the sub-discipline and update the analysis of the uneasy relationship with the wider discipline of Sociology itself.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper presents an account of the development of the sociology of education in the UK, by means of an analysis of papers published in the field's flagship journal, the British Journal of Sociology of Education and its US equivalent, Sociology of Education. In particular, we examine the representation of two contrasting traditions in addressing social inequalities: 'political arithmetic'; and the more recent 'cultural turn'. We find that in the UK, the cultural turn dominates; whilst in the US, it is political arithmetic which does so. In accounting for these contrasting national profiles, we argue that they are underpinned by divergent social infrastructure and organisation. We also discuss some of the implications of the dominance of the cultural turn in the UK, specifically in terms of the relationship between the fields of academic research and policy and the development of a cumulative evidence base to address social inequalities in education.</str>

    <str name="description">In this paper, we consider the intensifying pressures on critical research and academic integrity in a research policy context that has come to be increasingly dominated by an instrumentalist mind-set. Using sensitising resources drawn from Geoff Whitty's critique of the 'what works' agenda, we reflect on the current conditions of academic labour and some of the key issues and dilemmas they pose for critical researchers in the sociology of education and beyond. In particular, we underline the trend for 'what works' agendas to become constitutive of academic identities and practices, including at micro-levels, such that the option of 'standing outside' them is shifting from being merely personally taxing to being institutionally disallowed. In addition to highlighting the dilemmas this creates for critical researchers and the threat this poses to expansive and democratic approaches to education, the paper emphasises the centrality of relationship-forming in understanding and underpinning academic integrity.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores how White privilege and a hierarchy of oppression have resulted in competing identities in which gender has been given greater importance compared to race. I argue that the sociology of education needs to adopt an intersectional approach that travels in different directions if it is to remain valid. The article examines how gender, perpetuated by White privilege, continues to play a key role in the positioning of Black and minority ethnic staff, students and pupils within a range of stereotypes that operate to marginalise their life trajectories. The article argues that if sociologists of education are unwilling to challenge White privileged populist discourses and their own positions of White privilege, then they will become complicit in maintaining a socially unjust status quo.</str>

    <str name="description">Reflecting through the prisms of past, present (&amp;quot;the shape of things that are and were&amp;quot;) and future (&amp;quot;the shape of things to come&amp;quot;), this paper discusses three challenges for sociology of education: the rise of populism and declining faith in 'experts'; inequities within and re/produced by the sociology of education; and how to enact a sociology of education that can 'make a difference' to social inequalities. The paper puts forward some ideas in support of a current and future practice of the discipline that is pluralistic and orientated towards social justice. Arguments are made for the value of public-orientated dialogue that is conducted in a range of registers and the importance of acknowledging and engaging with the 'debt' (Ladson-Billings) that is owed to minoritized communities and minoritized researchers. Finally, a case is made for a sociology of education based on the principle of service as enacted through praxis partnerships.</str>

    <str name="description">The advent of massive open online courses and online degrees offered via digital platforms has occurred in a climate of austerity. Public universities worldwide face challenges to expand their educational reach, while competing in international rankings, raising fees and generating third-stream income. Online forms of unbundled provision offering smaller flexible low-cost curricular units have promised to disrupt this system. Yet do these forms challenge existing hierarchies in higher education and the market logic that puts pressure on universities and public institutions at large in the neoliberal era? Based on fieldwork in South Africa, this article explores the perceptions of senior managers of public universities and of online programme management companies. Analysing their considerations around unbundled provision, we discuss two conflicting logics of higher education that actors in structurally different positions and in historically divergent institutions use to justify their involvement in public-private partnerships: the logic of capital and the logic of social relevance.</str>

    <str name="description">The impact of self-fulfilling prophecy in education, and of attainment grouping on pupil self-perception, remain topics of longstanding debate, with important consequences for social in/justice. Focusing on self-confidence, this article draws on survey responses from 9,059 12-13 year olds who were tracked by subject ('setting'). They provided survey responses when placed in 'ability' sets at the start of their secondary schooling, and again late the following year; enabling analysis of impact over time. After controlling for prior attainment, the gap in general self-confidence between students in the top and bottom sets for mathematics is shown to widen over time, and high set students' self-confidence in English had also grown significantly; although there was not further widening in the cases of self-confidence in mathematics or in general self-confidence between students in the top and bottom sets for English. Implications of these findings for interventions directed at addressing educational disadvantage are discussed.</str>

    <str name="description">While investigation on family estrangement is growing within academic circles, research regarding the interconnection between experiences of estrangement and higher education (HE) is still limited. Sociological understandings of these issues are even scarcer, with policy interventions and practical guidance forming early interventions in HE. Set within the context of Scotland, this paper explores the experiences of HE students who are estranged from their family, and interrogates the ways students develop a sense of identity in the context of their academic lives. The paper applies Goffman's work on stigma and identity management in relation to Bourdieu's concept of capitals to cast a critical eye on the identity formation of estranged students. In doing so, we challenge normative assumptions of what it means to be a university student in contemporary society and urge institutions and policy makers to rethink the complexity of students' academic lives in more inclusive ways.</str>

    <str name="description">While the scholarly work on the second generation of immigrants has scrutinised both high educational achievers and marginalised groups, less attention has been paid to those in between and their aspirations. In this article, we draw on interviews with 35 adolescents pursuing vocational education in Norway. Our analysis takes as its point of departure a seemingly recurring paradox throughout the interviews. While all the interviewees are in their second year of vocational training, the majority express aspirations of moving beyond vocational occupations and attaining higher education. Building on the scholarship on class and moral worth, we argue that classificatory struggles about value represent an important but often overlooked context of integration. When the students position themselves as individuals who will move on to higher education, their aspirations can be understood as acts of self-constitution and moral boundary work.</str>

    <str name="description">Educational expectations are a key predictor of educational attainment. Throughout adolescence, friends increasingly function as 'significant others' and, thus, can affect the development of these expectations. Although scholars often interpret the clustering of students with similar expectations within friendship networks as the outcome of peer influence, a similarity of friends can also be a result of friendship selection processes and preselection due to ability tracking. We apply multilevel social network models to panel data of adolescents from Germany (1,992 ninth-grade students in 91 classes) to disentangle these mechanisms. Beyond selecting similar friends (homophily), we find that adolescents adapt their expectations towards the average expectations of their friends (social influence) but only in secondary-school tracks that support diverse educational paths. We conclude that peer socialization is important for the development of students' educational expectations in contexts that are sufficiently heterogeneous to allow for the emergence of distinct peer milieus.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper makes a contribution to the developing field of the political economy of educational technology and to an understanding of the significance of digital technologies for home-school relations. The digitalisation of social life is increasing and the impact of digitalisation on home-school relations, parents, and children is under-researched. This article draws on a new qualitative study where fifteen mothers were interviewed about parenting a primary school aged child in England with a focus on digital technologies, home-school relations, and parenting. I argue that processes of digitalisation are contributing to a bureaucratisation of home-school relations. Drawing on Weber's social theory, I argue that managing communications and information is taking precedence over other aspects of parental involvement in education. In this process, digital technologies are contributing to increasing demands for involvement in education that are placed on parents, reinforcing the wider norms of the intensification and professionalisation of parenting.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This study aims to understand the ways in which children's play is situated in and shaped by middle-class parenting practices in South Korea. Drawing on a set of data collected through semi-structured interviews with 16 parents having children aged 6-11 years, I observe that despite the widespread rhetoric of the significance of play, parents' scheduling of their children's daily routine centres around 'study', while play, especially free play, is left for in between times and limited spaces. Play is prominently associated with and instrumental in developing children's social skills and ensuring their emotional state. In line with the trend in the Global North where a broader concept of play is being institutionalised and incorporated into organised enrichment activities, play spaces are increasingly becoming a site of strategic family consumption. The changing geographies of play strongly reflect the neoliberal climate which generates anxiety and exhaustion related to parenting practices.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper compares the professional role and identity of teachers in private and state schools. It brings together theory within the sociology of the professions and approaches influenced by Basil Bernstein. It utilises his work on recontextualisation to identify the nature of teachers' professional &amp;quot;role&amp;quot;; and Beck and Young's (2010) Bernstein-influenced analytical framework to understand changes in these teachers' professional &amp;quot;identity.&amp;quot; Drawing on focussed qualitative research the study shows how, within private schools, when cloistered from the Official Recontextualising Field (ORF) an idealized account of teachers' professional work flourishes. This idealized understanding of occupational professionalism is contingent on the 'othering' of the state sector: to do this private-school teachers adopt a deprofessionalization discourse which represents the state teacher as a passive receiver of the ORF. In contrast, state teachers foreground their agency to negotiate competing professional logics which they express through hybrid approaches to professional practice.</str>

    <str name="title">&amp;apos;Marginal&amp;apos; Student Mobilities: Cruel Promise, Everyday Mobile Belonging and Emotional Geographies</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Xu, Cora Lingling</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article reviews three books: (1) &amp;quot;Student Mobilities and International Education in Asia: Emotional Geographies of Knowledge Spaces&amp;quot; (R. Sidhu et al., 2019); (2) &amp;quot;Everyday Mobile Belonging: Theorizing Higher Education Student Mobilities&amp;quot; (K. Finn and M. Holton, 2019); and (3) &amp;quot;Refugees in Higher Education: Debate, Discourse and Practice&amp;quot; (J. Stevenson and S. Baker, 2018). At the time of writing this review, many universities around the world are facing unprecedented challenges brought forth by the COVID-19 global pandemic. Almost over night, universities have had to move teaching and assessment online, while closing many of their buildings on campus. These sudden changes have serious implications for students, who find themselves having to adapt to new ways of learning and interaction amid growing anxiety and uncertainty. Student mobilities, no matter daily commutes to and from universities, or transnational movements from one country to another, have been curtailed, unduly reinforced or coerced, in the face of such novel circumstances. It is, therefore, high time to consider student mobilities with renewed theoretical and empirical lenses. This collection of three books is a welcomed addition to literature on student mobilities as they focus on the 'marginal' forms of student mobilities. Here, 'marginal' refers to the marginalised positions of the students or institutions involved, or the under-explored modes of mobility carried out by students. Specifically, Stevenson and Baker (2018) zoom in to the multiple barriers that refugee students encounter daily in the UK and Australia, Finn and Holton (2019) examine the commuting experiences of 'living at home' students in England, while Sidhu, Chong, and Yeoh (2019) chart the emotional landscapes of international students choosing to study in universities situated in the relative periphery of knowledge production, i.e. East Asia. Together these three books offer much needed empirical details and theoretical tools that add to the existing, predominant focus on the 'large-scale international and intercultural movements' (Finn and Holton 2019, p. 1) of students from positions of relative privilege to study in centres of knowledge production (i.e. in the West) (Brooks and Waters 2011).</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Henshall, Amanda</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Concerns about youth violence and the radicalisation of pupils have contributed to the deployment of onsite police officers in schools in England. Little is known about the work these officers do. This article firstly outlines the policy background that led to police in schools, and then, with a focus on the schools in London that have onsite officers, data obtained from a Freedom of Information request are combined with school characteristics data to show that officers are more likely to be based in schools with high levels of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. Foucault's work on surveillance is explored in theorising police presence on school sites. The relevance of Agamben's &amp;quot;State of Exception&amp;quot; is examined in relation to the school-to-prison pipeline in the United States. The article highlights the need for more empirical work in schools to research the impact of onsite police.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Muddiman, Esther</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Both educational policies and academic literature assume that students take an instrumental approach to their studies at university. However, despite wide-ranging discussions in the academic literature about contemporary arrangements and practices in higher education, empirical examinations of these conditions are notably scarce. This article reports on a comparative qualitative study into undergraduate students' accounts of studying business or sociology at universities in Britain and Singapore. Drawing on Eric Fromm's distinction between learning as 'having' and 'being,' the article demonstrates that--regardless of national context--those studying business displayed many elements of passive, instrumentalised, or 'having' orientations to learning, whilst those studying sociology showed clear signs of the more active and less instrumental 'being' mode of learning. By examining subject allegiance across national borders, this article underscores the importance of recognising subject choice, alongside other important contextual factors, in moving towards a nuanced understanding of student dispositions.</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores how a formal state examination system operates as a tool which enables the cultural reproduction of the middle classes in an increasingly market-driven education system in Ireland. It is based on a study of a group of final-year girls approaching the high-stakes terminal Leaving Certificate examination. The success of this reproduction is based on a mutually beneficial partnership between the school and the parents, which ultimately benefits the students. The article examines how the school is successful in this competitive education market place and in upholding the middle-class nature of schooling. The structures of the school also empower parents and students to enhance privilege and academic success. The article concludes by considering the continuing relevance of Bourdieu to social reproduction in education.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines how the outcome of neoliberal educational reforms has affected urban schooling in the inner city of Stockholm--making it into a centralized nexus or a 'hot-spot' for students and schools. The aim is to analyse how geographical place and space have become major distinctive criteria in inner-city students' educational strategies, as well as a comparative advantage for upper-secondary schools in the fierce in-between school competition. The data consist of interviews with close to 120 participants, official statistics and marketing from 55 inner-city upper-secondary schools. Our findings suggest that the growing commodification and upward socio-spatial homogenization of the inner city both affect the way schools use spatial representations in their marketing and also the strategies deployed by students in their school choice.</str>

    <str name="description">This article focuses on the pedagogical project of the Hizmet Movement, with a special focus on its gender politics as they were activated and performed at one of the movement's schools in a peripheral rural city in western Turkey. Through an ethnographic, conversation-based account of female teachers as active and committed adherents of the Movement, this article traces a two-tier approach to the community's pedagogical project: the first is the examination of micro-institutional mobilization units of the Movement, while the second tier is an analysis of key themes in the discourses surrounding gender, characterizing the role and the extent of women's participation in the movement. Drawing on the central gender discourses of the movement, this article reveals the emerging pedagogical model developed by the Movement as the constitution of a new hegemonic form, which I call the 'conservative sisterhood.'</str>

    <str name="description">This article analyses the relationship between cannabis use and educational trajectories among 42 young drug users, recruited at addiction treatment centres in Denmark. Quantitative research shows regular cannabis use to be associated with poor school performance and drop-out. However, these studies do not pay much attention to differences between educational tracks or to the links between the educational field and other fields. Drawing on a Bourdieusian framework we analyse the interviewees' involvement in four different fields: the academic field, the field of vocational schools, the labour market field and the artistic field. We contribute to the literature on post-16 educational trajectories by showing how successful 'investments' in education depend not only on available resources (capitals), but also on the ability to navigate in an increasingly complex educational system. Furthermore, we show how regular cannabis plays into the 'illusio' of different fields, challenging the interviewees' playing of educational games.</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores the relationship between educational outcomes and anti-school attitudes at different levels of social organization in schools. Data were collected in St. Petersburg, Russia (104 schools, 7300 students) and analyzed using multi-level regression models that included three levels: individual, clique of friends and school. A clique is defined as a tight group of friends in a school class; we used social network analysis software Kliquefinder for clique identification. We demonstrate that friends' attitudes are strongly related to the educational outcomes of a student (net of person's individual attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics). In contrast, school-level effects disappear in the multi-level model when individual characteristics are included. The results of the study clearly demonstrate that the socio-economic and curricular differentiation of schools does not always lead to the polarization of 'school academic cultures'. A school social environment is sufficiently heterogeneous, and different value systems in small peer groups may coexist.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines emerging techniques of educational governance--based on time, difference and potential--enabled by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's PISA-based Test for Schools ('PISA for Schools'). I show how PISA for Schools facilitates the production of difference through comparative test data, allowing educators to imagine, and bring about, different potential futures. Drawing on Deleuze's thinking around forms of difference, and the governance function of potentiality, and informed by interviews with key PISA for Schools policy actors, I illustrate how the visualisation of difference produces a local desire amongst schools and educators to become other than they currently are across multiple temporalities, and how this 'impetus to action' makes new actions and futures possible. This constitutes what I theorise as 'governing through difference and potential', where the underlying logic is for teachers to work on themselves in the present to continually improve the future.</str>

    <str name="description">The research explores Hong Kong students' dispositions towards higher education and employment in relation to understandings of their schooling experiences in English Medium of Instruction (EMI) schools in Hong Kong. The research draws upon Bourdieu's theory of practice, Appadurai's notion of the 'capacity to aspire', and Taylor's concept of 'social imaginary', to help make sense of students' aspirations for the future. Data included observation notes and interview transcripts with members of six focus groups across three distinctive schools in Hong Kong. Analytically, the research shows how aspirational dispositions and logics formed through specific configurations of the broader cultural and social milieu of Hong Kong, middle-class familial practices, non-elite EMI schooling experiences, and the place of English in Hong Kong, were complicit in fostering a sense of ambivalence about the future for these students.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Despite the expansion of the UK higher education (HE) sector, young people from disadvantaged backgrounds remain less likely than their advantaged counterparts to apply for or be offered a place at university. Whilst attempts to widen access have tended to revolve around raising aspirations and attainment, this article makes a case for the consideration of differential access to subjects seen as directly 'facilitating' university entry. Through exploring opportunity structures in three secondary schools in England (one private, one state in a wealthy area and one in a socio-economically disadvantaged area), this study highlights inequalities in the GCSE and A Level options presented to pupils. Whilst some schools provide a wide landscape of opportunities and support with constructing subject 'packages', others are left to work within timetable blocking systems which restrict subject options. Overall it argues that young people's academic portfolios must be viewed in the context of the opportunities presented to them.</str>

    <str name="description">This article presents the theoretical foundations, methodological approach and results of a school support project involving 154 primary school pupils, with low academic performance, in a region of Catalonia (Enxaneta Project). Drawing on the later work of Basic Bernstein, specifically his notion of pedagogic device, the project is based, on a theoretical level, on the use of the notions of classification and framing and of distributive, recontextualising and evaluative rules to analyse the dominant pedagogic practice and propose alternatives. Methodologically, the project works through an intense, professional mentoring with children and families. It is based on mixed pedagogies with four objectives: a) to question the current school pedagogic practice characterised by a regulatory discourse that generates inequalities in its link between power, knowledge, pedagogic identities and forms of consciousness; b) to enable families to enter the school physically and symbolically and share it with mentors and teachers; c) to improve teacher expectations towards children and families; d) to reduce or subvert, as the final goal, initial inequalities. The results obtained (quasi-experimental design) enable us to affirm that the Enxaneta children improve significantly more than the non-Enxaneta children in linguistic and mathematical tests, but not in school marks.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper is concerned with the spatial experiences of Emirati higher education women students. It presents some of the unique ways they engaged with and appropriated their campus space. To understand and explore women's spatial experiences as manifested through their spatial practices, appropriation and emerging spaces, I conducted an ethnographic qualitative inquiry with multiple levels of data gathering and analysis. I utilized social theories of space specifically the social construction of space and Lefebvre's triad as a theoretical framework for this study. The emerging spatial practices of 'togetherness' and 'sitting on the floor' were highly informed by aspects of women students' identity and socio-cultural formation, with an evident link to their traditional past that intersects with their specific nation's modern demands and challenges. Although Emirati women learners' spatiality might resonate with that of other women learners, their spatial practices are context and culture specific.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Hurst, Allison L.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In the United States, attending a selective liberal arts college is often a sign of success. Human capital theory assumes graduates from these colleges share similar outcomes, in terms of employment and further education. This article reports, findings from a national (US) survey of liberal arts college students who graduated between 2012 and 2014. It finds significant differences in the immediate post-graduation outcomes of students based on family background. Using a Bourdieusian lens of capitals and habitus, the article links these different outcomes to differential experiences while in college, expectations, and parental resources. As in the public sector, classed pathways operate to produce differential outcomes for students of small liberal arts colleges. The article also demonstrates the continuing role of family-based material resources after graduation, and how these are used to differentiate students even when holding similar amounts of social and cultural capital.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Haugen, Cecilie Ronning</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">As part of neoliberal reforms, evidence-based practice is increasingly influencing teachers' work. In Norway, the American programme 'School-Wide Positive Behavioural Intervention and Support' (SW_PBIS) has been implemented in a great number of schools. One school experienced an intense conflict with parents, so that eventually it opted out of the programme. Using Basil Bernstein's framework, this paper investigates what the conflict was about and how it can relate to class and ideology. The conflict was rooted in the ideological foundation of the programme, as well as its unintended negative effects. The teachers' unexpectedly persistent support of the programme may be explained by the fact that it offers them a way out of taking personal responsibility for a pedagogically challenging situation. Looking into the role the specific contexts play may contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between class, values and practices as teachers' hierarchical relations may be changing.</str>

    <str name="description">The aim of this article is to contribute to the development of research tools for the analysis of the special education curriculum. More precisely, using the concepts of classification and framing from the theory of Basil Bernstein, we approach the intended curriculum for students with mild and moderate learning difficulties. To be specific, using the content analysis method, we approach the school knowledge that refers to the teaching of pre-vocational skills. The research results revealed that according to the special education curriculum, the implementation of a weak classification is recommended for the shaping of school knowledge regarding pre-vocational skills. In addition, in order to teach this knowledge to students with mild and moderate learning difficulties, the application of mixed pedagogical practices, drawn as much from an invisible pedagogy (weak pacing) as from a visible pedagogy (strong framing of didactic-interactive relationships and of evaluative rules), is recommended.</str>

    <str name="title">&amp;apos;Other Spaces&amp;apos; for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered and Questioning (LGBTQ) Students: Positioning LGBTQ-Affirming Schools as Sites of Resistance within Inclusive Education</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores the growing interest in schools which are aimed at children and young people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered and questioning (LGBTQ), schools described as LGBTQ-affirming. Schools which target specific groups of students are sometimes viewed as being anti-inclusive because they assign labels to students and separate them from one another. This is based on a notion of inclusive education as a single 'school for all'; a comprehensive, common school which is suitable for all children in a particular locality. Using academic literature alongside original data from an in-depth qualitative case study of an LGBTQ-affirming school in Atlanta, this article addresses the question of whether there is a place for LGBTQ-affirming schools within inclusive education systems. It argues that the word 'segregated' is not an accurate description of these schools, positing that segregated spaces are not the same as separate spaces. It argues that the separateness of LGBTQ-affirming schools is important to their role in inclusive education, specifically when they are positioned as examples of Foucault's heterotopias. Viewing them through this theoretical lens enables them to be seen as 'other spaces', as a form of 'resistance' and 'protest' which may 'unstitch' the utopian vision of inclusive education.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    <str name="description">In 2007, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) passed the 'Students Without Legal Immigration Status Policy', commonly known as the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. While the policy assured undocumented students' admission to schools on paper, it remains to be fully implemented. In addition, given the discursive connection between immigration status, race, and criminalization, the TDSB has instituted procedures that further illegalize undocumented students including a more onerous and dangerous enrolment procedure. This paper examines the role of schools as border zones for undocumented immigrants in Toronto. It argues that bureaucratic processes and criminalizing rhetoric based on race actively exclude undocumented migrants from the school site.</str>

    <str name="description">Recent research demonstrates that, along with the family, the peer group and the school environment, extra-curricular activities are important contexts for young people's educational and social development. This article is the result of a survey conducted with a sample of young people in their last year of compulsory school in Sweden and examines both who has access to the different types of extra-curricular activity and the consequences of their participation in the various programmes. As the results indicate, after controlling for respondents' class and migrant background, their gender and their health, there are positive and significant associations between participation in certain types of activity (sporting, cultural and religious) on the one hand, and students' school performance and educational expectations on the other. However, attendance at a less-organised activity (youth recreation centres or &amp;quot;fritidsgård&amp;quot;) shows a negative association with these outcomes. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the gender, social class and migrant background of students affect their rate of participation in many of these activities.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Codiroli Mcmaster, Natasha</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Prior research has shown that students from less educated families are less likely to study both science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects and arts and humanities subjects. This article used a large representative sample of university students in England to explore the relationship between students' enjoyment, perception of ability and socio-economic disparities in subject choices. Although these attitudes differed by students' parents' education level, and were associated with subject choices, disparities in choices persisted when accounting for these differences. Students with less educated parents were less likely to choose arts and humanities and more likely to study social sciences, law and business, over STEM, even when their enjoyment and perception of ability in subjects were similar. Students whose parents had higher levels of education were more likely to choose STEM over arts and humanities as their enjoyment of STEM increased, suggesting different underlying processes informing student choices by social background.</str>

    <str name="description">Using newly available data from the Trajectories in Education and Careers Study, the first longitudinal study on a representative sample of high school students in Russia, we examined the importance of investments in human and cultural capital on students' mathematics and reading standardized examinations, as well as on the likelihood of matriculation into a selective institution of higher education. Studying mathematics and the Russian language on one's own for more than a year was positively and significantly associated with standardized scores and with an increased likelihood of matriculating into a selective university. A higher number of books at home was also associated with an increased likelihood of matriculating into a selective university. The findings are discussed within the particular institutional context of the Russian educational system.</str>

    <str name="description">With schools coming under pressure to perform and produce outcomes, the caring practices of the institution have been increasingly framed around issues of achievement, excellence and outcomes. In this article, we examine how the performativity-driven practices of care impact on the possibilities of social inclusion for marginalised students. Drawing on case study data from two 14-year-old students in a government secondary school located in a low socio-economic suburb of Melbourne, Australia, we argue that the performative ethic of care fails to cater for the more complex needs of these students. Lacking the qualities of 'good student' as independent and successful learners, these students are positioned and treated differently in their schools, leading to their weak sense of belonging to the institution. We maintain that a plural social justice framework focusing on the politics of redistribution and recognition can provide the basis of a socially just education for marginalised students.</str>

    <str name="description">In this article, I aim to determine whether, in view of the trend of educational expansion in recent decades in Brazil, the role played by schooling in the labor market of Brazilian major metropolitan regions has changed, becoming positional rather than absolute. To this end, I analyze the influence of schooling on people's income and occupational status. Based on data from the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD-IBGE) for years 1995, 2005 and 2015, I compare ordinary least squares models that use absolute and positional measures of schooling. The results show that the explanatory power is greater for positional measures than for absolute ones, and that this advantage has increased over recent decades. As a result, it is argued that although educational expansion possibly makes the chances of access to a certain absolute schooling level less unequal, it also ends up undermining the opportunity structure related to it.</str>

    <str name="description">A recent UK Government commissioned study found concerning levels of unemployment among computing students from disadvantaged, black and minority ethnic backgrounds. The study highlighted that work experience was a factor in increased levels of graduate employment. As such, it is vital that students have equal access to such work experience. This study considers the availability of work experience to 140 computing students at two city centre UK universities. Data analysis considered socioeconomic background and ethnicity to determine if these influenced attitudes to work experience. While students' socioeconomic backgrounds and ethnicity had little influence on their interest in work experience, patterns of success in gaining work experience reflected worrying graduate (un)employment patterns, with those from disadvantaged, black or minority ethnic backgrounds less able to secure work experience. These findings have serious implications for university and government policies promoting work experience and highlight the need for national interventions.</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores class, capital, and aspiration to social mobility in an ethnographic study of an English secondary school. In particular, the article considers the school's musical instrument programme as a site for inculcating forms of capital, under the auspices of developing skills for upward social mobility. Bringing together Bourdieu's conceptions of schooling with theories of materiality and situated learning, we contend that this school succeeds in cultivating new forms of embodied capital among students through the development of communities of musical practice. However, a tension remains between emancipatory aims of the programme and the sanctioning and championing of certain forms of dominant cultural practice. The learning environment of the instrument programme highlights the complex and conflicted impact that schooling can have on the development of cultural capital and on reproducing disadvantage and difference.</str>

    <str name="description">This article analyses the association between social class and parent-­initiated contact with teachers. Hypotheses are derived from Lareau's theory on 'concerted cultivation' and status maintenance theory on rational educational decision-making. Data from a national survey on French students traversing secondary school are used to study social class differentials in parents' involvement in Grade 9 when students are about to proceed to an important transition from lower to upper secondary school. Linear probability models reveal that the likelihood that parents initiate meetings with teachers decreases as students' performance increases and that concerted cultivation beliefs have positive effects. Through inclusion of interaction terms into the models, clear evidence is provided that middle-class parents are more likely to seek a meeting than working-class parents when their children face difficulties.</str>

    <str name="title">Teacher Evaluation as an Onto-Epistemic Framework</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Holloway, Jessica</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article analyzes the constitutive and productive effects of one US middle school's teacher evaluation system, and the way it operates to (re)make teacher subjects. Using transcripts from interviews with teachers and evaluators, as well as policy and system protocol documents, the article demonstrates how a positive evaluation discourse has become the structuring framework for legitimizing high-stakes evaluation, normalizing constant surveillance and audit, and producing new teacher subjects who assemble themselves as perpetually imperfect. The article illustrates how the evaluation system has produced a culture of compliance where the teacher's professional and ethical identity is constituted by the tools, practices, and norms of evaluation. It argues that the evaluation system is an onto-epistemic regime that fundamentally reconstitutes the purpose, identity, and function of the teacher subject. This article raises new questions about who a teacher can be, what types of attitudes can be imagined, and what actions can be exercised.</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores the impact of global policy shifts toward 'national integration' on schooling for refugee youth in Kenya. Based on interviews and classroom observations in Kakuma Refugee Camp, we theorize that integration manifests in a multidirectional, hierarchical manner as few refugees integrate &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; into government schools, while most integrate &amp;quot;down&amp;quot; into segregated camp schools. We examine how youth interpret and navigate these oppositional paths, imbued with assumptions about quality and status. We argue that global policy can foster structures for physical integration; however, social integration, integrally connected to protection and opportunity, depends on local strategies and practices, encompassing formal decisions about adapting policy, as well as embedded beliefs about the purposes of educating refugees and their long-term inclusion in host societies. This study responds to calls for deeper sociological attention to education and global migration, as states expand educational opportunities for refugee populations while negotiating educational rights amongst citizens.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Leaney, Sarah</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article builds upon a tradition of feminist critical engagements with Bourdieu, developing the concept of 'foregrounded history' as a way to conceptualise the temporal and affective in processes of habitus formation. Through analysis of affects 'produced through the social encounter' within everyday childhoods on a British council estate, the article explores habitus as histories both embodied and felt in the present. Drawing upon ethnographic research conducted within the interrelated fields of the Primary School and the Community Centre, this article considers processes of distinction, disagreement and resistance in the formation of classed positionings on The Estate.</str>

    <str name="description">Many countries, including Italy, are increasingly managing their public higher education systems in accordance with the New Public Management principle that private-sector management practices improve efficiency and quality. A key mechanism has been the introduction of performance-based funding systems designed to reward 'high-performing' institutions and incentivise 'lesser-performing' institutions to improve. Instead of improving efficiency and quality across the board, however, we argue that performance-based funding systems naturalise longstanding structurally determined inequalities between institutions by recasting national higher education systems as competitive institutional meritocracies in which institutional inequalities are redefined as objective indicators of intrinsic 'merit' or worth. We illustrate how performance-based university funding systems naturalise pre-existing inequalities between universities drawing on the case of Italy, a country characterised by longstanding inequalities between its northern and southern regions which demonstrably impact on the apparent 'performance' of universities. The concept of institutional meritocracy captures the illusory nature of this performance game.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Given the ambition to decrease gender segregation in higher education, it is essential to understand the considerations made by the gender minority in segregated fields of study. This article interprets the resistance met by girls choosing gender-untypical paths, and analyses how they explain and justify such choices. The context of Norway provided both the framework for the study and a lens for understanding the girls' experiences. Interview data show how the girls understand their own and others' educational choices in light of ideas of gender equality. Arguably, claiming to be 'one who dares', and anchoring their choices in egalitarian ideals, strengthened their motivation in the face of resistance. Furthermore, the resistance was not rooted in stereotypes around competence but based on gender role expectations. This suggests that cultural beliefs about women as primarily caretakers, and the notion that appearance relates to educational choices, are more resistant to change than stereotypes about women and technical competence.</str>

    <str name="description">The arts are under threat in English schools. But some schools and teachers work against the trend. To understand how they continue to offer rich arts experiences to students, we bring Bourdieusian thinking to arts teacher practices that were common across the 30 secondary schools we studied for three years. In addition to a flexible approach to the curriculum which encouraged independence, intellectual challenge and risk-taking, teachers also engaged in arts brokerage -- embodiment of arts engagement, ensuring students regularly visit cultural events/institutions, using local cultural resources, organising visits from artists/cultural organisations, enabling students to exhibit and perform for wider audiences, connecting students with arts workplaces and enhancing community arts participation. We approach this as a logic of practice associated with arts broker dis/positions drawn from teachers simultaneously occupying two chiasmatic fields -- art and education.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines the constraints of modern temporality which are antithetical to the careful consideration that working with diverse learners requires for the development of inclusive, democratic education. We take up the conceptual construct of time to explore how it mediates systemic practices that impact policy positions of inclusion in initial teacher education and schooling. Our analysis demonstrates that temporality shapes the possibilities of inclusive practice within which a dominant agenda of compliance frames classroom complexities -- both in schooling and higher education environments -- into fragmented and preconceived responses to challenging situations. Education systems position educators in risk discourses concentrated on compliance and performance, in part through an emphasis that is placed on the diagnosis of learner differences and subsequent compartmentalised responses. Through schisms in modern time, we demonstrate the ways in which inclusion, like other educational demands, may be supported through a diffraction in time rather than subjugated to it.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article suggests that a process of de-academisation is discernible in the way the Erasmus year abroad is promoted, organised, supervised and evaluated. The article argues that rather than being a product of students' consumerist rationalities, this process is produced within the conditions of the managerialised and under-resourced university. This process is underpinned by institutional discourses and practices that devalue academic capital, in line with the employability agenda and the corporate critique of higher education as outdated and too abstract for the real world. Based on a qualitative study conducted in Ireland, the article uses a Bourdieusian lens to examine the de-academisation of study abroad and the field--habitus clash experienced by participants. Finally, the article draws attention to the implications of this neutralisation of academic capital in a context where academic credentials are increasingly devalued in the labour market.</str>

    <str name="description">In 2016 the world witnessed a consolidation of a western brand of political 'populist authoritarianism' that is anti-globalisationalist and creates 'shared objects of loathing' in the popular imagination. This article engages with the implications of this affective and masculinist 'post-truth' era for higher education and analyses the narratives of teacher educators who teach compulsory classes based on inclusion and diversity. The article uses the work of feminist, Indigenous and queer theorists to explore gendered responses to pedagogical encounters recounted in the data. We offer a reading of these experiences that links white male objections, particularly around the teaching of gender and race, to the growth of neoconservatism that precipitated the contemporary rise of populist authoritarianism. The pedagogical encounters we explore reflect the notion that the Australian white male is a figure who is brought undone by allowing the subaltern to speak.</str>

    <str name="description">The benefits of reading for pleasure and positive reader identities have been well established in previous research. However, much discussion regarding young people's reading is underpinned by a discourse of deficit, placing emphasis on what young people should be reading. In an attempt to move away from this discourse, this article considers reading in the context of young people's broader social and cultural worlds, exploring the role of the peer group in young people's development of a reader identity. The article argues that the reading practices young people engage in are part of their broader social and cultural participation and, consequently, part of a broader project of identity formation. By highlighting the complexity of young people's development of a reader identity and the meaning ascribed to specific reading practices, the findings challenge deficit models of young people's reading lives, which underpin attempts to redistribute cultural capital through educational and cultural policy.</str>

    <str name="description">Through the case-study experiences of 24 White and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) working-class students from three very different universities, we aim to illuminate the often hidden struggle for recognition and respect for classed, 'raced' and gendered ways of being in the university. We discuss how the students perceive their identities in relation to their universities and their peers, and whether they feel the need to adapt and change their classed/'racialised' identities in order to survive and progress or whether they resist any pressures and expectations to do so. We explore the tension between 'assimilation and belonging' and 'betrayal and exclusion' for White and BAME working-class students and consider the intersectional implications. We draw on the concept of hybridity to show the fluidity and fusions of transitioning and developing identities. The article also seeks to contribute further to the illumination of habitus as generative, through a process of hybridity.</str>

    <str name="description">Building on the sociological work by Lareau, this study examined the association between students' socioeconomic background, prior achievement and the perception of teacher support within the classroom. We expected that students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds would be more critical about the support they receive in the classroom and rate their teachers more negatively, while those with higher prior achievement would perceive teacher support more positively. Multilevel models confirmed that there is a negative association between wealth and students' perception of two dimensions of teacher support, and a negative association between parental educational attainment and one dimension of teacher support. Our findings were in line with the 'sense of entitlement' theory by Lareau. Having higher prior achievement was associated with a more positive perception of teacher support, but did not seem to interact with socioeconomic background.</str>

    <str name="description">We bring together the theories of Bourdieu and Sen in order to understand the processes that influence the study paths chosen by young people with a general degree from a science university in France. The weighting of economic and cultural capital within study options taken in secondary education and during the premier cycle (the first three years of tertiary education) helps characterise elements of students' trajectories which either stymie or reinforce a nonetheless dominant reproduction.</str>

    <str name="description">With more graduates, degree outcomes have a renewed significance for high-achieving students to stand out in a graduate crowd. In the United Kingdom, over a quarter of undergraduates now leave university with the highest grade -- a 'first-class' degree -- although students from non-traditional and underprivileged backgrounds are the least likely. This article explores the experiences of high-achieving non-traditional (HANT) university students. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 30 final-year students who are on course to achieve a first-class degree from working-class, minority ethnic and/or mature backgrounds, we examine their pathways to academic success through identity works and negotiations. We argue that early successes are crucial for students to re-evaluate their self-expectations as students who can achieve in higher education, while self-esteem, pride or fear can prevent students from maximising their available resources and opportunities. Implications for practice and policy are discussed, including the reflective advice from HANT students towards academic success.</str>

    <str name="description">This article is concerned with the influences that are brought to bear on the design of school buildings and the effects that the design of these buildings have on those who teach and learn in them. The article also focuses on the ways in which design is altered in and through the practices of these occupants. We argue that there is a mutual shaping of design and practice in these schools. We deploy the theory of socio-genesis developed by Lev S. Vygotsky and the sociology of pedagogy developed by Basil Bernstein in order to study the consequences for students of different trajectories of transfer between different designs and pedagogic cultures of primary and secondary schools in England. Our intention is to contribute to current debates about the effects of new school designs and the enduring concerns raised by difficulties that some students encounter in transitions between schools.</str>

    <str name="description">Many approaches to explaining educational inequalities relate explicitly and implicitly to benefits of education, and rational choice theories in particular consider monetary benefits. We specify a concept of the value of education that allows for an empirical analysis of educational benefits, considering both monetary and non-monetary dimensions (instrumental goals) outlined in social production function theory. Our objectives include introducing a sound theoretical framework, the validation of an empirical measurement instrument and an analysis of the differences between certain dimensions of educational values structured by social origin, gender and immigrant background. Analyses are based on a two-wave panel study (SASAL-School Alienation in Switzerland and Luxembourg) carried out in secondary schools in Luxembourg and Switzerland. We distinguish four dimensions within the concept of values of education: stimulation, comfort/status, behavioural confirmation and affection. The different dimensions of the value of education are influenced by gender and immigrant backgrounds in both national settings.</str>

    <str name="description">The marketisation of schools has emerged as a defining feature of the education landscape. While the role of principals and lead teachers in carrying out marketing work was investigated in the late 1990s, there has been scant evidence of how the people and practices of marketing in schools have evolved into the twenty-first century. Expanding on existing literature on educational marketing practices in schools, and through in-depth interviews with a unique sample of school marketers, this study explores the emergence of the school marketing professional. The interviews reveal the diverse backgrounds and experiences of these individuals, the transfer of their business skills into schools and the tensions in professional boundaries with educators who traditionally performed school marketing activities. Ultimately, the study furthers insights into the co-existence of educational and managerial agendas in the schools market.</str>

    <str name="description">Empirical studies focused on cultural capital only emerged since the 2000s in South Korea. This article is the first to conduct a systematic review aiming to shed light on how the theory of cultural capital has been applied in South Korea. Our main goal is to understand: how the cultural capital-students' achievement association in South Korea differs from research in western industrialized contexts; and how cultural capital has been defined, and which dimensions have been highlighted as core elements of social reproduction in South Korea. Based on an examination of both quantitative and qualitative studies published since 2000, our analysis suggests that, contrary to the focus on the highbrow culture or classed-based parenting practices in western literature, the institutionalized striving for upward social mobility through education and a popular desire to acquire globally convertible cultural capital is key to unpacking the notion of cultural capital in the South Korean context.</str>

    <str name="description">Faith schools may play an important role in reproducing ethnoreligious identities, yet research into Jewish schools has tended to overlook students' personalised conceptualisations of faith. Instead, it has regularly utilised restrictive 'indicators' of ethnoreligious practice in order to gauge these institutions' effectiveness in 'strengthening' Jewish identity and thus mitigating assimilation. In response, this article explores the ways in which students at a pluralist Jewish school negotiated and (re)shaped their Jewishness, and thus lived their identities in personally meaningful ways. Students articulated 'symbolic' forms of Jewishness, rooted in inclusive and often stereotypical cultural symbols rather than regular religious practice, and personalised their identities through the school's amenability to diverse manifestations of faith. Consequently, the research illustrates the value of including young people's perspectives of faith and faith schooling, with implications for understandings of ethnoreligious identity and practice in spaces beyond traditional religious sites such as places of worship.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article draws together a comparative sociological analysis and a political theory perspective to interpret children's views on the role of school and being a pupil, and what these tell us about their conceptual representations of citizenship and belonging in France and England. The article presents research findings from a cross-national ethnographic study with children aged 10 and 11 years in two primary schools, one in France and one in England. This article shows that children's views generally reflected national value orientations around citizenship and belonging, but that these conceptions of citizenship were not always fully understood by children, and masked, in some cases, deeper mechanisms of exclusion. This raises questions about the place of citizenship in education in France and England, and calls for a deeper understanding of the ways in which conceptions of citizenship are formed through children's experience of school.</str>

    <str name="description">Evidence suggests that early education can promote children's development and narrow attainment gaps between those from lower-income and higher-income families. However, realisation of these potential benefits depends on many factors, feasibly including peer composition. We use national census data for a year-group cohort of children in England in 2011, to answer two questions: how are low-income children distributed across pre-schools; and what is the relationship between the proportion of low-income peers in a low-income child's setting and these children's subsequent recorded educational attainment? In contrast to many European countries and to the United States, we find that the majority of low-income children attend mixed settings. We find little evidence for associations between the proportion of low-income peers and low-income children's subsequent early attainment. We suggest that this may be due to an arguably optimal distribution across settings, where the funding and provision context of 2011 facilitated a lack of clustering of low-income children.</str>

    <str name="description">While various forms of teachers' habitus have been described in education studies, little consideration has so far been given to their interaction with fields in schools. This article draws on Bourdieu's theory and related concepts of field, habitus, capital and doxa to explore types of teacher professionalism, especially in Austrian secondary schools where innovative measures and reforms have been introduced. By combining a model of teaching profession with a Bourdieu-based analysis in the interpretation of 70 interviews with secondary school teachers, we show that a double field structure has emerged in some schools, where a field of traditional teaching competes with one of new professional field teaching. We argue that further initiatives will be needed from the field of education policy and other forces in society to stabilise the field of new professional teaching. This article illustrates the dynamic interrelationship between professional habitus and conflicting fields in one particular school.</str>

    <str name="description">This project investigated the postsecondary education aspirations of 27 secondary school-aged students living in greater London, England and greater Boston, Massachusetts, USA. An innovative research design was implemented to support a technology-facilitated international focus group allowing for exchanges between the US and English students. Using human ecology theory, the findings show that differences in students' exosystems, specifically the financial aid and loan repayment processes, influence student postsecondary education and career aspirations. US student concerns about affordability and loan repayment made aspirations lower and more localized. In contrast, English participants felt comforted by their government's deferred loan repayment process, so they did not express such strong constraints on aspirations based on financial considerations. Both English and US students were influenced similarly by the mesosystem when making decisions about which postsecondary institution to attend. In conclusion, altering exosystem policy and influencing mesosystem relationships could impact postsecondary education aspirations for low-income students.</str>

    <str name="description">Framed by a poststructuralist theory of identity, this phenomenological study explores Bhutanese refugee youth's lived experiences before and after resettlement and the ways that these experiences influence their identity navigation. Data from this study come from a two-year ethnography with a recently resettled Bhutanese refugee community in a northeastern US city. By focusing on four Bhutanese refugee youth and two current Bhutanese refugee youth club collaborators who used to be teachers in the camp in Nepal, the findings indicate that the essential nature of refugee youth's lived experience is a way of being, becoming, and imagining. From past to present, from camp to campus, refugee youth adjust not only to their situated environment, but also to who they are and who they want to be. This study highlights refugee identity as a multi-layered and multi-faceted construct, which is related to others, contested, imagined, power driven, and constituted by social practice.</str>

    <str name="description">Disturbing, problematic, or challenging student behaviour is said to be among the greatest challenges facing today's school life. However, despite the apparent commonsensical nature of the issue, there is no commonly agreed upon definition for such events, and there is often very thin analysis of what actually becomes disturbed, challenged, or problematised in such instances. In this article, disturbing behaviour is seen as a discursive practice that produces reality; it is a historically and socioculturally formed coming-together of various intersecting power-related discourses that make claims about individuals and contexts. Informed by post-structural approaches, this theoretical article looks at how ideas of disturbing behaviour come to be formed within the discursive environment of school. The article argues that behind the idea of disturbing behaviour are the ideas of a normal developmental course and an idealised student, as well as increasing emphasis on management and measurement in school.</str>

      <str>Högberg, Björn</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Inequalities in health and well-being are important contemporary public health issues. This article is the first to investigate the institutional causes of inequality in well-being among youth in a comparative perspective. Data from the European Social Survey are used to analyse how educational policies moderate the association between social background and well-being. Multilevel techniques are used to investigate cross-level interactions between social background and educational policies on life satisfaction. Four indicators of inclusive educational policies are analysed: age of tracking, costs of education, enrolment rates, and second-chance opportunities in the educational system. The results show that educational policies indeed moderate the association between social background and well-being: inequalities as measured by the father's social class are smaller in countries where educational policies are more inclusive. Moreover, the analysis shows that the moderating impact of education policies is mediated by individual-level education, activity status, and income.</str>

    <str name="description">Social class differences in educational decision-making form an important explanation for persisting educational inequalities, particularly in choice-driven systems with early tracking. Nevertheless, little is known about the process preceding these choices, especially when school and track choice are interrelated. Building on school choice literature, this study aims to explore how parents from different social backgrounds shape their decision-making process at the transition from primary to secondary education in Flanders (Belgium). To this end, we adopt an explanatory mixed-methods design. Quantitative findings from a parent survey conducted in 36 primary schools were complemented with 32 in-depth interviews with parents. Our findings show two parental profiles regarding educational decision-making, which can be traced back to differences in social and cultural capital. Although effective navigation of the complex field of educational decision-making proved to be strongly class related, parents' educational and immigrant biographies led to specific approaches, transcending the middle class versus working class binary.</str>

    <str name="description">This article advances current conceptions of teacher activism through an exploration of the social justice dispositions of teachers in advantaged and disadvantaged contexts of schooling. We interrogate the practices of teachers in a government school, with a high proportion of refugee students and students from low socio-economic backgrounds, in a high-fees, multi-campus independent school, and in a disadvantaged Systemic Catholic school to illustrate how Bourdieu's notion of dispositions (which are constitutive of the habitus) and Fraser's distinction between affirmative and transformative justice are together productive of four types of teacher activism. Specifically, we show that activist dispositions can be characterised as either affirmative or transformative in stance and as either internally or externally focused in relation to the education field. We argue that the social, cultural and material conditions of schools are linked to teachers' activist dispositions and conclude with the challenge for redressing educational inequalities by fostering a transformative activism in teachers' practices.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This study draws on the concept of cultural capital to determine whether the cultural capital of students is related to their perceptions of classroom interactions, specifically teacher--student feedback practices. The analysis of new data in 'Feedback and Cultural Capital,' a Danish survey of feedback practices among 14-year-old and 15-year-old students (N = 1101), showed a positive and practically linear relationship between the cultural capital of the students and the amount of feedback they perceived in lower secondary mathematics classrooms. Drawing on Bourdieu's theory of cultural reproduction in education, I argue that this inequality stems from either or both of two mechanisms: differences in treatment by teachers and/or differences in the perceptions of students. I link both mechanisms to the cultural capital of the students. Furthermore, the results indicate that the relationship was stronger for boys than for girls. The implications of the findings for practice and policy are discussed.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article draws on an analysis of the narratives of Australian young Muslim women to explore their higher education experiences and aspirations. The article aims to explore the notion of agency employed by Muslim female university students in relation to the ways they discover their own capabilities along their deployment of available financial, cultural and social resources under cultural and structural constrains. The women's accounts suggest that pursuit of higher education is highly perceived as a key to girls' success and economic independence in the present precarious neoliberal environment yet concerns over Islamophobia and gender and racial discrimination which may curtail employment opportunities are present. The research findings also suggest that educational outcomes entail complex forms of negotiation, bargaining and resistance, stressing the ways in which class, gender, ethnicity and religion interrelate.</str>

    <str name="description">This article considers a recent policy initiative in assessment in English primary schools (ages 5-11 years) in which curriculum 'levels' used by teachers to judge pupils' attainment were suddenly removed. Previous work has largely focused on assessment of pupils, but we examine assessment as an activity through which teachers reproduce their professional standing. Using data from a small-scale study we investigate how teachers responded to these changes and what this tells us about the way in which the economy, and politics, of assessment practices operate at school level. Using Foucault as a theoretical framework, we make visible how this system was reorganised by teachers through the construction of new regimes of truth. Implications include evidence of a potentially damaging changing relationship between teachers and pupils, the key role of technology and the deleterious effect of neoliberalism on teachers' and pupils' relationships with both the process and subject matter of learning.</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores the impact of educational mobilities on the ethnic identity construction of minority students in China. Adopting 'temporality' as an analytical tool, the article highlights the dynamic temporal multiplicity in ethnic identity construction by comparing longitudinal in-depth interviews of a Mongolian student and a Tibetan student. This multiplicity of temporality is manifested in three aspects: temporality of ethnic othering; temporality of ethnic identity awakening; and temporality of 'worldly time' and 'ethnic time'. Both 'worldly time' and 'ethnic time' entail distinctive understandings about these students' pace and priorities in life. Both students defer their 'permanent' ethnic identity to an imagined future. Yet, adopting the gaze of the dominant others, both students subconsciously constructed an essentialist view of their ethnic cultures as fixed and stable, and those of the dominant cultures as alive and fluid. This article enriches our understanding of the politics of subjectivation through the lens of 'temporality'.</str>

    <str name="description">This article critically examines bilingual, intercultural education policies and practices in El Salvador and Mexico. In the context of legacies of assimilation and neoliberal homogenization, certain kinds of citizenship become prioritized over others. This is visible where performances of local identity clash with state mandates about educational content and the language of school instruction. I address the effects of state agendas in schools on the politics of multiculturalism and argue that the absence of state commitment to bilingual, intercultural education undermines democratization efforts by marginalizing certain types of citizens more than others. By considering ethnic minority education in both El Salvador and Mexico, I analyze in a comparative perspective the ways that indigenous people have been rendered invisible as citizens unless they are willing to assimilate in the arena of formal education.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">A governmentality ethnographic approach is adopted to examine the everyday making of school in Buenos Aires slums. By addressing events at the intersection of the life of school and of the neighborhood, in this article we problematize schooling -- how it is put together and the tensions that beset it on a daily basis. The notion of the self-made school is proposed as a way to delve into how management society calls on the population to manage itself. We identify micro-procedures that take the shape of silent struggles to turn the school/neighborhood into a place to live. As a hypothesis, we propose that school is produced at the intersection of everyday struggles and the struggle for the everyday in the context of the precarization of life in the age of management. From a methodological standpoint what are at play are not dichotomies, but rather the stickiness and tension of daily practices.</str>

    <str name="description">Chile is recognized in the educational policy field as one of the first laboratories of neoliberal initiatives. These policies, initiated under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, did not change with the new democratic governments after 1990. This characteristic led international organizations to promote the Chilean policies in different contexts in Latin America and beyond. In 2006, a high school student movement occupied public and private schools, demystifying the outcomes of these policies. A new wave of demonstrations took place in 2011, with a college student leadership that paralyzed a significant amount of universities and schools throughout the country. After both waves of mobilizations, the political system opened the process of policy-making that considered the demands of social movements. In this article, we explore the dynamics between educational policies and social student movements in Chile, and the possibilities of change in favor of public education.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines from a historical and contemporary perspective the political, educational and linguistic demands of Mapuche intellectuals and organisations and how they have been addressed by public policy in Chile. In particular, the article focuses on the Araucanía Region, part of the ancestral territory of the Mapuche people. We adopt a documentary and ethnographic approach to analyse the context, the development and the transformation of Mapuche demands in a political environment influenced and exacerbated by certain actions by both the state and indigenous organisations. The analysis focuses on education and the tensions generated under Chile's neoliberal economic model, affecting the decisions and everyday lives of families and children, especially indigenous families, in the Araucanía Region.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article assesses the position of post-colonial societies within a neoliberal paradigm through an analysis of the role of language in education and the importance of adequate academic preparation for social development. Generally, teacher-student interactions constitute the foundational substance of learning processes. Since education revolves around language, omitting the way language affects classroom instruction amounts to omitting a key factor that might impede or facilitate education. Because these interactions tend to happen around textbooks, and given that textbooks are often ideologically saturated, an analysis of interactional patterns and textbook discourses may help to assess how the education system can improve students' academic development and the external efficiency of the system. The article makes the case for post-colonial societies to define strategic visions that are in concert with their specific needs, as opposed to being strangled into grand narratives such as neoliberalism that may be counterproductive for the growth of their societies.</str>

    <str name="title">The Geographies of Collective Identity in the Chilean Student Movement</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article is about collective identity, learning processes and political agency in the Chilean student movement. The geographies of collective identity are constituted through engaging with emotions interwoven with the political learning process by making mistakes that enabled student activists' agency to undergo transformation between 2006 and 2011. Space articulates an identity politics as the bio-politics of existence through which life itself becomes a political action and animates a radical imaginary of politics as being-in-common. This meaning of politics is interwoven with the production of territorial assemblies in 2011 through which the Chilean student movement reasserted the space-time of the political demand for free education in spatial rather than temporal terms by reimagining a collective vision with others. This represents the main legacy of the movement and becomes a condition of possibility for envisioning free education as an alternative project that seeks to contest neoliberal common sense.</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores how social movement co-governance of public education offers an alternative to neoliberal educational models. The Brazilian Landless Workers Movement (MST) is one of the largest social movements in Latin America. We describe one of the many schools that the MST co-governs, the Itinerant School Paths of Knowledge (Caminhos do Saber), located in an occupied encampment in the state of Paraná. We analyze three of the most unique pedagogical innovations in the school: the teacher's incorporation of 'portions of reality' into classroom teaching, the student work collectives, and the participatory student evaluation process. Although these pedagogies are seemingly mundane changes to everyday school practice, we argue that they represent a challenge to the neoliberal educational model being implemented globally. These movement pedagogies are likely to continue, despite recent conservative attacks, and they offer several concrete lessons for how to effectively contest neoliberal educational practices in other global contexts.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines the perceptions of education in Turkey, which refer to a nebulous package of formal education and a cultured stance. Guided by the literature on symbolic violence, we argue that underprivileged groups misrecognize arbitrary hierarchies by considering them just and inevitable. Elite tastes have been internalized by other groups in a particular historical context of education and culture. We investigate the historical roots of this seemingly ahistorical constellation of power relations around education and then consider the implications for the neoliberal period. Then, we contextualize the responses to symbolic violence. Subordinate groups complicate the effects of symbolic violence by exhibiting diverse responses that range from outright submission to implicitly questioning cultural and moral boundaries, creating class and ethnic others in the process. This occurs by constructing cultural and moral boundaries, especially targeting the 'vulgar' culture of celebrities and Kurds.</str>

    <str name="title">Two Adult Women Managing Career and Family after Mature Higher Education: Alternative Notions of Agency?</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lee, Sunghoe</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This biographical case study explores how two South Korean middle-aged married women have managed their career and their family commitments over the period of 9 years after their mature higher education. In doing this, this study focuses on the role of agency with reference to the structure of gender throughout these women's experiences. Biographical narrative interviews were conducted four times over the 9 years to trace various changes to their lives. The analysis suggests that the two women's agencies were ostensibly different, but were quintessentially embedded within their intimate relationships in common. Drawing on the empirical evidence, this study seeks to address alternative notions of agency that highlight endurance, interdependence with close relations, emotion and affection, which exert a gradual but powerful impact on others and society. This study, therefore, disturbs the prevalent notions of a self-directed and rationalistic model of agency and its individualistic and dichotomous relation with structure.</str>

    <str name="description">The purpose of this paper is to critically evaluate Archer's reflexive modalities in relation to Further Education (FE) students' higher education (HE) decision-making and choices. To do this, it draws on data from a qualitative, longitudinal narrative inquiry that explored how socioeconomically under-represented FE students made their HE decisions and choices. On a conceptual level, the research aimed to identify whether participants' HE decisions and choices were individualised or mediated by structure. Margaret Archer's reflexive modes were adapted to understand, first, how young people made their educational choices and decisions and, second, what role agency and structure played in this process. How participants' different reflexive modes were interpreted and how this facilitated more intricate understandings of how agency is exerted in the face of structural constraints are discussed. Yet, this paper also critically reflects on and questions the explanatory power of Archer's work in the context of this research.</str>

    <str name="description">Using critical race theory, this article examines the racial positioning of British international minority ethnic (IME) academics in predominantly White institutions (PWIs). Empirical data, in the form of 28 in-depth interviews with IME academics, is used to analyze the complex raced and gendered positionalities of IME academics in institutions of higher education in the United States. We argue that the institutional contexts of predominantly White universities continue to re-affirm White privilege in ways that reflect the struggles in higher education to diversify faculty at PWIs. As scholars call for more diversity across higher education campuses, we suggest that it is important to understand the interconnections between policy and practice surrounding attempts to recruit and retain IME academics.</str>

      <str>Vincent, Carol</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper explores how teachers respond to the requirement to promote 'fundamental British values' (FBV) to their pupils. It offers a preliminary analysis of data drawn from interviews with teachers and (mostly lesson) observations in schools. It argue that, first, the policy cannot be understood without a consideration of the multi-layered context in which it is being enacted in schools. Second, it locates the policy to promote FBV as a liberal nationalist one and considers some of the problematic issues that arise from this philosophy. Third, it turns to schools and teachers to consider their reactions and responses. It is concluded that teachers and schools in this research often did attempt to neutralize potentially exclusionary readings of the policy and were effective in absorbing the requirement to promote British values. However, doubt is cast on the policy's ability to meet its aims and the paper also raise concerns about the limited amount of time given to pupils' engagement with the values.</str>

    <str name="description">Situating in the different social, political and cultural contexts of schooling in China, which is more embedded in mixed neoliberal value, authoritarian state control and collective morality, we use a somewhat different theoretical angle to understand the process of 'learning to labour' and the reproduction of working class at school and at work. Our study extends the horizon of Willis' analysis of cultural reproduction at school by seriously analysing students' work experiences through their internship at the site of production. Taking a sociological rather than cultural analysis approach, we re-conceptualize working-class agency embedded in a double contradiction of schooling as a site of contestation. This double contradiction is generated by conflicting experiences caused by inevitable conflicts among the three spheres of material production, social reproduction and cultural reproduction in educating ideal labour subjects to serve the state, market and family, providing fertile soil for re-negotiating working-class solidarity.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">By designing products that ultimately structure meaning in lessons, the industry that produces teaching materials for schools shapes teaching practice and everyday learning situations in schools across geographical borders. The design and development of such learning resources is a professional practice that has hitherto received very little academic attention. This lacuna is addressed in our paper, which presents an analysis of this aspect of educational practice based upon insights gained from ethnographic research. Light is shed upon specific ways of addressing and guiding pupils, teaching staff, and customers, which result from processes of negotiation between representatives of different professions including scientists, teachers, publishers and distributors. These processes ultimately provide classrooms with products that have been shaped by ideas about schooling. It becomes clear that the development of such materials is shaped by multiple perspectives on school education. As an exemplary case study, we describe in detail the process by which such materials make well-known, everyday phenomena abstract or 'alien' so that they can then be recontextualised and presented anew -- as phenomena to be understood with the aid of school-taught knowledge.</str>

      <str>Flynn, Naomi</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article presents original insights into the English learning experiences of Polish children and contributes a longitudinal perspective on teachers' relationships with them. Data from interviews conducted in 2016 with primary school teachers, Polish children and their parents are compared with outcomes from an earlier study ending in 2009, in order to examine whether teachers' practice for their Polish children has persisted or changed. Previously, findings suggested that teachers in England are constrained by a monolingually-oriented curriculum and that they identify Polish children as a 'model minority'. In the current study, interviews with teachers, parents and children were used to develop and question these findings. Using Bourdieuian notions of linguistic field, habitus and capital, data analysis illuminates: the changing responses of teachers to migration; the ways in which teachers' pedagogy has adapted for children who have English as an additional language; and the fluid nature of children's linguistic identities.</str>

    <str name="title">Are Education and Nationalism a Happy Marriage? Ethno-Nationalist Disruptions of Education in Dutch Classrooms</str>

      <str>Siebers, Hans</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Following Gellner, citizenship education has often been framed in terms of nationalism. This framing is supported by methodological nationalism that legitimizes nationalism as either functional (civic nationalism) or natural (ethnic nationalism). Based on a triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data, this study of the dynamics in the classes of a Dutch faculty of social professions highlights the disruptive impact of nationalism on citizenship education, spilling over to other courses as well. Ethno-nationalist discourses in Dutch media and politics as well as in multiculturalism approaches used in citizenship education fuel conflicts between non-migrant students and students with a migration background that disrupt education. It is argued that in globalized settings like these classes, a more viable approach to citizenship education would take an institutional instead of communitarian perspective.</str>

    <str name="description">Since the mid-1990s, important education policy changes, such as the growth of Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS) schools and the reform of the medium of instruction (MOI) policy, have been made in Hong Kong. Little is known about their impact on school segregation and educational inequality. We address this issue using six successive cycles of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study data. We found evidence for rising levels of secondary school segregation in terms of family socio-economic status and mathematics achievement from 1995 to 2011, whereas segregation declined from 2011 to 2015. We speculate that the salience of the MOI policy in expediting the segregating tendencies of the DSS sector might explain a growing magnitude of the effect of family socio-economic status on academic achievement between 1995 and 2011, and the reversed direction of such trends between 2011 and 2015. Implications are discussed.</str>

      <str>Eriksen, Ingunn Marie</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article addresses school resistance in ethnic minority girls. Girls' school opposition is mostly described as covert. If described as hostile, it is rarely understood in terms of femininity. Through psychosocial analyses of extensive fieldwork and interviews with students in a Norwegian upper-secondary school, the article describes an affective practice in which young minority girls reject school aggressively. I argue that through their school opposition, the girls are constituting a transgressive femininity that that does not jeopardise their ethnic belonging or their femininity within school. Their aggression is fuelled by the experience of disentitlement from success in a school perceived as being for ethnic Norwegians and not for them. Although the noisy girls at Skogbyen act in a way that is locally accepted, they still act in opposition to the larger gender order -- which comes at a cost.</str>

    <str name="description">In this study, we explore Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and the 'legitimated procedures' of increasing capacity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Conducting interviews with HBCU presidents, we argue that as HBCUs contend with a conflicting national context, investment in STEM education is perceived as a strategic pathway to address institutional concerns. Our findings suggest a departure from institutional theory, in that HBCUs' choices demonstrate a strategic motive of survival and adaptability to changes in the organizational field of American higher education. Their unique location in the American higher education system means they have to balance both organizational and institutional pressures to both survive and maintain fidelity to their historic mission.</str>

    <str name="description">This article considers the understandings of space and place amongst a group of disaffected students within an institution that had been in a state of flux over a number of years. The article explores ways in which students are positioned by institutions into specific spaces, ways in which they use those spaces to challenge authority and ways in which they appropriate both space and place to assert new, and often playful, identities. The authors consider the meanings of the spatial behaviour of students through notions of space and place as developed by Doreen Massey, with reference to a Foucauldian understanding of power. In some ways, the students might be perceived as being marginalised, victims of a hierarchical environment in which their status is low. Yet they also emerge as active agents, forging new interpretations of their surroundings and robust group identities, and reinforcing in-group relationships through spatial behaviour.</str>

    <str name="description">We examine separate and combined effects of children's body size and gender on school bullying victimization in the United States. Second-grade data for the 2012/13 school year from the US Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort, 2011 were analyzed, hierarchical generalized logistic modeling was used, and three forms of school bullying were studied. Girls were less likely than boys to be verbally or physically bullied, and obese children were more likely to be verbally and relationally bullied than non-obese children. The protective effect of gender extends to obese girls when obesity is not a risk factor (physical bullying). When obesity is a risk factor, gender is not protective (verbal bullying) or is a risk factor (relational bullying) for girls. These findings suggest that an intersectional body size-gender lens is crucial to understanding how inequality is produced through school bullying. Future interventions should incorporate an intersectional understanding of school bullying.</str>

    <str name="title">Missionaries or Mercenaries? How Teachers in Elite Private Schools Embrace Privilege</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Variyan, George</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article is based on a multi-site study of teachers in elite private schools in Australia. Teachers' accounts from this study bring nuance to the reasons one might short-handedly expect they have in working for these exclusive institutions. It is not that everyday motivations don't matter, for example, the financial compensations, the beautiful grounds and the status payoffs, but that teachers bring their own discourses, histories and intentions to bear on the contradictions of their work-lives. This is crucial evidence for understanding how privilege functions, how teachers are not simply co-opted or constrained. Instead, this article brings into view the agency of teachers who embrace privilege in spite of thorny questions around educational inequality that elite private schools cannot avoid.</str>

      <str>Harger, Brent</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Since the late 1990s, increased public and academic attention has been focused on topics related to bullying and peer aggression in schools, yet these behaviors have proven difficult for schools to address. Using data from an ethnographic study of two rural elementary schools in the Midwestern United States, I make both methodological and theoretical contributions to the literature on this topic. Methodologically, I show that examining 'minor' aggressive behaviors in schools reveals the way that more serious issues are also normalized. Theoretically, I show that students and adults actively construct shared understandings in these schools regarding the normalization of aggression, increasing the frequency of these behaviors, limiting the ability of adults to effectively deal with them, and contributing to the stigmatization of students who do not accept them. These findings add to our understandings of bullying and aggression in schools and the relationship between school cultures and peer cultures.</str>

    <str name="description">Less privileged students disproportionately aim low with their university applications and often fail to apply to the institutions that match their academic qualifications. Little attention, however, has been directed toward the converse phenomenon, that of aiming high. These kinds of applications are commonly called 'reaches,' meaning an applicant's credentials fall slightly below the institution's range for the average first-year student. Using nationally representative survey data from the United States, this study examines whether social background predicts the likelihood of applying to reach institutions and assesses the consequences for disparities in enrollments. We find a strong relationship between students' socioeconomic background and their likelihood of applying to reach institutions, even after controlling for a range of academic and non-academic characteristics. Further, there is a substantial pay-off to applying to reach institutions, revealing the degree to which these class-based choices at the application stage contribute to the social stratification of higher education.</str>

    <str name="description">The myth that justified the takeover of a continent lives on both in classrooms and in popular media. Drawing from classroom observations in an urban primary school in Australia, this article enters the technology in education conversation, more specifically through the use of videogames for learning. Based on classroom exchanges between teachers and students, we interrogate how the school's use of &amp;quot;Minecraft&amp;quot;, a best-selling commercial videogame, continues to reproduce myths of settler colonialism in the twenty-first century. Specifically, the curriculum mobilizes structures inherent to both &amp;quot;Minecraft&amp;quot; and modern Australia's treatment of its Indigenous populations. That is, both classroom and videogame interactions reproduced the myth of &amp;quot;terra nullius&amp;quot;: the doctrine which determined that land, prior to colonization, was empty and unowned, and therefore available for settlement by the colonizer. We conclude that within videogames and classrooms, students' voices manage to interrogate the curriculum, resisting the reproduction of erasive coloniality in school.</str>

    <str name="description">This article discusses the changes in basic education in Turkey, with a particular focus on religious education and its ramifications for the education system. The latest education reform, 4 + 4 + 4 (or 4+), the largest education reform in recent Turkish history, has brought radical changes to the school system regarding religious education. For this research, journalists and teacher unionists were interviewed to investigate civil society's perspective on the reform. Several themes were extracted from the data analysis but this article focuses on one dominant theme, namely the rise of religiosity. We argue that the state and its private associations (i.e. media, unions and political parties) are actively encouraging a process of Islamisation and a gradual but stronger emphasis on Islam in the public sphere in order to consolidate its hegemonic dominance.</str>

    <str name="title">Does Outsourcing School Systems Degrade Education Workforces? Evidence from 18,000 English State Schools</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Martindale, Nicholas</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Critics claim that outsourcing the running of 7000 state-funded schools under England's Academies Programme has caused a rapid increase in the number of pupils taught by teachers without Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). However, it is unclear whether Academies are simply more exposed to contexts associated with higher rates of teachers without QTS than schools still controlled by local government. Analysis of a newly compiled dataset reveals that, net of context, the percentage of teachers without QTS is increasing in Academies relative to non-outsourced schools and that business-style governance is associated with greater Academy divergence from non-outsourced schools. Moreover, the Academies programme is widening class-based inequality in pupils' access to qualified teachers. This research, the first nationally comprehensive assessment of the impact of Academies on school workforces, draws into question the merits of neoliberal policies which outsource public services and undermine systems of professional accreditation.</str>

    <str name="description">The socioeconomic class system defines every aspect of life in Pakistan, education being one of them. Varied socioeconomic backgrounds along with a strongly discriminated education system produce individuals with a varying level of cultural capital that is familiarity with the dominant culture of society. Success in education is largely dependent upon inherent personality attributes or habitus, as defined by Bourdieu, playing a vital role. To understand the relation of students' cultural capital with architectural education from a neutral point of view, this study focuses on comprehending teachers' perception of the impacts of social background on students' personality and their performance in the design studio. Detailed semi-structured interviews are conducted with 14 design teachers from four architectural schools in Lahore. The results show that the majority of teachers believe that social background has vast impact on students' personality and defines their cultural capital, which dictates their design ability.</str>

    <str name="description">The transfer of human resource management (HRM) practices from the corporate business context into schools has taken a novel turn. No longer restricted to the management of school teachers, HRM techniques are now being applied to the management of students. HRM views the student as a human resource to serve the school, and seeks to systematically regulate students' identities in order to align them with school values and goals. This article introduces the Uncommon Schools model as an exemplar of student-centred HRM. The case study demonstrates how student-centred HRM is being operationalised in schools and concludes by exploring the potential effects on students of existing within an HRM system. The article is informed by critical management theories and argues that student-centred HRM constitutes a radical shift in the relationship between school and student.</str>

    <str name="description">This article focuses on middle-class parent activism in the Israeli policy-making arena. In recent decades, public education governance in Israel has been moving gradually from a quasi-social democratic mode to a neoliberal one. Two e-mobilizations of middle-class parents are studied: the 'Strollers Protest' of 2011 and the 'Sardines Protest' of 2014. First, we explore how these two protests used social media to promote changes in education policies. Next, we argue that social media can be used to promote both anti-neoliberal and pro-neoliberal policies in public education. We conclude by discussing the possible implications of social media on parent activism in the policy arena.</str>

    <str name="description">There is growing international interest in young people's post-compulsory education pathways. In contexts of 'widening participation' as university is increasingly 'normalised,' how do young people choose alternative routes into training and employment? While in Britain apprenticeships are a key aspect of government strategy, there are many challenges still associated with these schemes including low pay and inconsistent training. Drawing on longitudinal data from our qualitative research with young people on apprenticeship schemes in London, we use narrative analysis, informed by Goffman's theory of stigma, to explore how young people narrate and navigate the tensions between apprenticeships as opportunities to 'learn while they earn' and university degrees as the prevailing 'gold standard' of achievement and future success. Our findings show that while these young people were aware of the challenges associated with apprenticeships, they used specific rhetorical devices to reclaim the normalcy of their training pathways as 'sensible' and 'mature' choices.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Hewson, Dominic</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">It is 30 years since Vietnam implemented the 'Doi Moi' economic reforms. The subsequent influx of capital was accompanied by a general infiltration of foreign influences, arguably none more important than the English language. This article focuses on an area where market and language converge: the private English as a second language industry. Drawing upon the ideas of Pierre Bourdieu, the article utilises the experiences of teachers to examine industry practices, with particular emphasis on the consequences of education commodification. The article locates its findings within the wider contexts of Vietnamese education, economy and the global propagation of the English language and market ideals. These findings depict a profit-driven industry where the customer always being right is not always right for the customer.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Brooks, Rachel</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article investigates the ways in which students are constructed in contemporary English higher education policy. First, it contends that, contrary to assumptions made in the academic literature, students are not conceptualised as 'empowered consumers'; instead their vulnerability is emphasised by both government and unions. Second, it identifies other dominant discourses, namely that of 'future worker' and 'hard-worker.' These articulate with extant debates about both the repositioning of higher education as an economic good and the use of the 'hard-working' trope across other areas of social policy. Third, it shows that differences are drawn between groups of students. Contrasts are drawn, for example, between international students, juxtaposing the 'brightest and best' with those who are considered 'sham'. Finally, the article argues that the figure of the 'vulnerable' student and 'thwarted consumer' feeds into broader government narratives about its policy trajectory, legitimising contemporary reforms and excusing the apparent failure of previous policies.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article presents the results of a research project which examined the factors enabling educational upward mobility. The findings are based on 58 qualitative interviews with successful first-generation students who are scholarship holders from the German Academic Scholarship Foundation. From an in-depth analysis of the individual resources, three general requirements of upward mobility are derived. Based on these it is possible to distinguish three types of educational upward mobility. These types differ in the barriers they were confronted with, the resources available to them, the structure of their educational path and the way they experience upward mobility. A spectrum becomes apparent: at one end we find upward mobility due to a family which offers relevant resources, and at the other we see mobility despite a family which impedes higher educational attainment. The conclusion describes key aspects towards the development of a theory of educational upward mobility.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper is based on research into the destinations and aspirations of school leavers in Australia. It investigates the relationship between the transition to university for different groups of students and their own and their parents' and teachers' expectations. It draws on Bourdieu, Boudon, Nussbaum and others to investigate the way young people construct their aspirations. It examines the limits of young people's agency, which is bound by their understanding of the hidden and informal rules that govern access to different spaces within the curriculum as well as access to post-school destinations. Navigating these transitions is becoming more important and more complex with the increasing emphasis on higher level qualifications in an education market.</str>

    <str name="description">We present the experience of 10 British low-socio-economic status students who were supported by a charitable scheme to be internationally mobile and who are currently studying at a range of highly selective universities and liberal arts colleges in the North-Eastern United States. Based on semi-structured interviews and the discussion of artefacts symbolizing their experience, findings show that by moving across national contexts, cultural cues of socio-economic difference such as the vernacular become less recognizable, thus reducing the likelihood for 'social identity threat' and feeling of not belonging. The self-concept and habitus of these students is transformed, as they adopt the upper and middle-class dispositions and career pathways associated with elite college culture, thus suggesting the possibility of a wholesale escape of habitus.</str>

    <str name="title">School Competition and Social Stratification in the Deregulated Upper Secondary School Market in Stockholm</str>

      <str>Forsberg, Håkan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Drawing on the case of upper secondary education in Stockholm, this article analyses school-based responses to a superimposed market and how this is related to social stratification. Furthermore, schools' and pupils' encounters with the market are analysed in relation to Bourdieu's concepts of field, capital and strategy. Methodologically, the quantitative method of correspondence analysis is combined with semi-structured interviews with senior administrative officers and principals. Analysis shows how the overarching structure of this particular field -- a historically pre-existing social order of upper secondary education in Stockholm -- is related to the complex set of strategies that schools develop in the school market. Schools located at the elite pole of the field, serving the educational needs of a small minority of either the wealthy or the culturally rich upper middle class, are less affected by marketization. In the most populous social mid-tier of the field, schools are more likely to turn education into a mass-produced commodity, while schools at the socially dominated pole, without a competitive product, are more exposed to the market's stratifying impact.</str>

    <str name="description">The article critically discusses the practice of describing children's special educational needs (SEN) in early childhood education and care (ECEC) pedagogical documents. Documentation is understood as a form of governance. In current practice, documentation is extensively used in educational institutions. Even when the focus of documentation should be pedagogical, the descriptions of children's SEN commonly describe a child's individual deficits as a source of educational problems. In this study, we used discourse analysis to investigate how professionals position children and construct their SEN in pedagogical documents. The research data consisted of 143 documents on 29 Finnish children. Three ways of positioning children with SEN were identified in the documents: as a problematic child through definitive descriptions, as a multifaceted child through contextual descriptions, and as a learning child through dynamic descriptions. The results highlight the importance of a pedagogical focus and dynamic conceptualisation of SEN in ECEC documentation.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Dytham, Siobhan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article highlights the interactional work involved in relational aggression, and how rules and norms around sitting are used by students to achieve exclusion and dominance. This research took place in an English secondary school which educates pupils from Year 7 to sixth form (ages 11-18). Drawing on observation, walk-and-talk and group discussion data with Year 9 students (age 13-14), this research highlights how the girls developed shared rules and norms around sitting which, while seemingly reasonable and applied equally to all, are seen to facilitate and legitimise exclusion and relational aggression. Girls from different social groups collaboratively constructed and participated in a system of rules which were then utilised for dominance and exclusion by regulating where, when and how girls sat. Sitting is seen to be an important marker of ownership, both of people and places, as well as a group management tool within student social groups.</str>

    <str name="description">This article draws on case studies of four English schools to explore some of the ways in which trade union representatives in these schools see their roles and the role of their unions in relation to how policy gets done in their schools. The article attempts two things. First, it details and describes some discomforts, oppositions and resistances that are evident in these schools in relation to some of the educational reforms and policy imperatives that are in play. Second, the article connects these empirical instances to an understanding of resistance that embraces subtlety, contingency and contradiction, as well as the elision of accommodations and resistances that can occur, in order to trouble what is sometimes taken as 'a high level of compliance amongst teachers' in neoliberal times.</str>

    <str name="description">Drawing upon data generated by 303 young male footballers employed in 21 professional clubs in England and Wales, this article explores some key aspects of players' masculinities, identities and engagement with education. Although many players described their educational experiences in largely negative terms, some aspired towards averageness, or middling, which is often central to working-class identifications with education. Other players found education 'easy,' engaged in effortless achievement and had begun to internalize elements of the neoliberal achievement ideology. The propensity for players to engage in copying and pasting from the work of others, and to regard their courses as being almost impossible to fail, was consistent with neoliberal ideologies of credentialism and performativity. The findings suggest that a more nuanced understanding of young footballers' education is warranted, and their aspirations and experiences can at least be partly understood as responses to the prevailing neoliberal learning environments which they inhabit.</str>

    <str name="description">This case study employs a narrative approach to uncover the voice of a visual arts teacher who has been marginalized in a Macao private school where its teaching subjects have been structurally classified by means of (market) value. The teacher in this study adopted various forms of resistance under pervasive neoliberalism. Yet, with the inherent critical capacity and possibilities being dissolved and disarmed, these acts have largely ended up facilitating the expansion of her resilience. While she has paid efforts and successively 'survived' adapting to the challenging and threatening circumstance, and thereby has obtained a feeling of de-marginalization at school, these everyday forms of resistance have inadvertently reinforced and reproduced the very oppressive structure they aimed to transgress, which suggests the potential of this teacher being further re-marginalized.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper asks whether concerns about social problems decline with age. Unconditional growth models (without covariates) revealed a decline over 25 years (age 18 to 43) in concerns about racial discrimination, treatment of Aboriginal Peoples, female job discrimination, unemployment and environmental pollution. Educational attainment was not associated with these change trajectories in conditional control models, providing no support for enlightenment or social reproduction hypotheses. Higher household income (age 43) was associated with faster declines in concerns about racial discrimination, treatment of Aboriginal Peoples and unemployment. With household income as a predictor, downward trajectories in treatment of Aboriginal Peoples, female job discrimination and environmental pollution were no longer significant, and the racial discrimination trajectory was reversed direction. These results provide compelling evidence for status defence theory.</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores the patterning of student im/mobility internally within the United Kingdom, using exceptionally detailed student records data on full-time undergraduate entrants from 2014. For this cohort of students, geographic mobility was clearly the preserve of the most socio-economically advantaged, and was less common for Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups. Significantly, the student's 'home' region emerges as the most important factor driving im/mobility even when social, ethnic and educational differences are held constant. The concept 'structures of feeling' can help make sense of immobility in areas of the North-East, North-West and Wales, where students are likely to look on higher education choice through a different lens of accumulated and contemporary, inter-generational cultural experience. Exploring exceptions to the dominant trends, we also find a more complex patterning of im/mobility that is likely to reflect the deep historical and structural framing of young people's socio-spatial horizons.</str>

    <str name="description">The UK government is planning to increase the number of pupils attending state-funded selective grammar schools, claiming that this will assist overall standards, reduce the poverty attainment gap and so aid social mobility. Using the full 2015 cohort of pupils in England, this article shows how the pupils attending grammar schools are stratified in terms of chronic poverty, ethnicity, language, special educational needs and even precise age within their year group. This kind of clustering of relative advantage is potentially dangerous for society. The article derives measures of chronic poverty and local socio-economic status segregation between schools, and uses these to show that the results from grammar schools are no better than expected, once these differences are accounted for. There is no evidence base for a policy of increasing selection, and so there are implications for early selection policies worldwide. The UK government should consider phasing the existing selective schools out.</str>

    <str name="description">This article highlights the additional marginalisation of black female academics within the UK academy of higher education. The article engages with the narratives of eight such women as they navigate their careers as a minority-of-minorities within high-ranking institutions. The literature on black academic severe under-representation, intersectionality theory and the author's own experience as a black female academic is used abductively to story the narratives and engage the reader towards an emancipatory aim. Critically, it highlights the additional marginalisation of black academics due to racism and the double marginalisation of black females based primarily on their race and gender. The findings both confirm and richly contextualise the literature from an insider perspective. The narratives provide implications for policy and further research.</str>

    <str name="description">This article makes an empirical contribution to the study of the global middle class (GMC), and sheds light on the complex relationships that are constructed and sustained by these families with their 'home nation' through their educational strategies. Drawing on an inductive analysis of 20 in-depth interviews with Israeli migrant mothers in the United Kingdom who constitute a specific fraction of the GMC, this article examines families' identity constructions and how these shape their educational practices. The participants constitute a growing phenomenon -- highly educated, mobile middle-class families who live and move around the world, and position themselves using global frames of references. We emphasise how country of origin acts as a symbolic object in the cultivation of their children's identity and how different types of attachment to 'home nation' are perceived as offering valuable capital for the GMC. The article therefore contributes much-needed empirical analyses on education strategies within the GMC, and challenges the suggestion that critical to the definition of the GMC is that they are 'rootless'.</str>

    <str name="description">Based on in-depth interviews with doctoral students across different types of English higher education institutions, this study explores existing and perceived barriers to entering doctoral study. Previous research in widening participation and higher education access has neglected this level. Although the PhD is the highest educational qualification, there appear to be quite distinct, classed pathways in access to and through the doctorate corresponding to patterns of institutional stratification. PhD students do not comprise a homogeneous elite; rather, we detect at least three ideal-typical pathways to the doctorate. These pathways illustrate disparities among the community of PhD students, both between and within universities. Marked differences in funding, facilities and support carry consequences for individual chances of completion and the doctoral experience. Social and institutional stratification appear to work hand-in-hand in determining one's chances for achieving the 'promise' of the PhD, such as secure university employment and similar highly skilled work.</str>

    <str name="description">School socio-economic compositional (SEC) effects have been influential in educational research predicting a range of outcomes and influencing public policy. However, some recent studies have challenged the veracity of SEC effects when applying residualised-change and fixed effects models and simulating potential measurement errors in hierarchical regression models. We review the residualised change and fixed effects methods in critical studies and find limitations in their capacity to demonstrate null compositional effects. We show this with an adjusted residualised change model finding significant SEC effects. We show structural equation models can address concerns that measurement errors inflate SEC effects by comparing hierarchical regression models to structural equation models. We find that structural equation models can detect SEC effects free from measurement error. We conclude that the reviewed critiques of SEC effects were due to methods unlikely to detect compositional effects. Future research would benefit from the identification of mediators of SEC effects.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper reports the experiences of staff, parents, governors and students at a secondary free school in the West Midlands of England in relation to the inclusion of students with special educational needs (SEN). The paper is based on a qualitative research project carried out at a school that opened in 2015, with the explicit aim of examining the extent to which it developed as an inclusive school, particularly for children with SEN. In the paper, we draw on the classic distinction between 'education' and 'schooling' to identify tensions and overlaps between process and outcome oriented practices and examine the views of different stakeholders on how such practices impact on inclusion. By focusing on the day-to-day practices of the school and linking them to broader notions of schooling and education, we provide a complementary perspective on the current research on free schools, which is overwhelmingly quantitative and focused on admissions.</str>

    <str name="description">Recent studies question students' learning gains on college campuses. Even though academic challenges are further complicated for first-generation college students who arrive at college under prepared, little is known about how these setbacks contribute to students' cognitive and behavioral study approaches in college. Situated within a culture perspective and drawing on semi-structured interviews with first-generation college students and course instructors, this study assesses how students contend with competing academic logics in the transition from high school to college. Findings reveal that students draw on high school scripts to fulfill college coursework demands regardless of how ill suited those scripts may be. Students are not motivated to modify or retool existing scripts unless they result in unsatisfactory academic outcomes. We argue that retooling decisions are contrived within incentive-driven frameworks and suggest that these cost-benefit approaches impact first-generation college students' academic growth opportunities in detrimental ways.</str>

    <str name="description">Policy makers in the UK are trying to improve school meals, by focusing on eating well. This article explores the way policies are framed by academic performance and health as a reason for providing school lunches. Using Nussbaum's capability approach we argue that the purpose of schooling should be to provide young people with the ability to lead a life of choice. We argue that school meals are an important social good, which allow young people to develop critical skills around food which they can then use throughout their lives. We draw on evidence from two ethnographic research projects on food in schools, conducted in England. We question whether the collocation between healthy eating and learning should be the focus of school food reform and contemplate the role of society and government to provide children with healthy meals, irrespective of learning outcomes. School meals are more than good exam results.</str>

    <str name="description">This study examines Chinese international doctoral students' academic socialization into TESOL discourses and communities. Rooted in the academic discourse socialization theory, complemented by the notions of Lave and Wenger's &amp;quot;community of practice,&amp;quot; and Bourdieu's &amp;quot;capital,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;habitus,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;field,&amp;quot; this longitudinal multiple-case study suggest the focal participants' academic discourse socialization is mediated by their participation in communities of practice, different forms of capital, and habitus in exerting agency. The participants are socialized into academic discourses and communities through their interactions with more experienced colleagues. By participating in the communities of practice, the focal students gain different forms of capital and experience different degrees of competence and memberships. However, due to the inequitable power relations in the TESOL doctoral program field, each participant is socialized to varying levels of central, peripheral, and marginal participation. This study concludes by providing suggestions for action to be taken by university advisors, instructors, and administrators.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper is based on findings from an email interview study with 20 academics (17 women, 3 men) in the UK on short-term, insecure or 'casualised' contracts. The paper focuses on their perceptions of the effect their contract status has on the lecturer/student relationship: particularly in regard to student perceptions of their legitimacy and status. Using a poststructuralist theoretical lens, we explore lecturers' concerns or anxieties as to whether they may be interpreted as less legitimate than permanent staff; and the emotional labour involved in the work done to 'cover' for the difficulties that a lecturer's contract status causes for the quality of their teaching content and organisation. We also explore the considerations of some participants to voluntarily 'disclose' their status to students and the possibilities of such acts as a form of resistance to dominant discourses of the legitimate academic.</str>

    <str name="description">Enhancing learner agency in urban schools is seen as increasingly important in educational policy for narrowing existing attainment gaps. However, notions of learner agency are contested and require conceptual clarity. To help generate such clarity a conceptual synthesis of the field was undertaken that resulted in a mapping framework around three distinct and yet interrelated perspectives: (a) micro-individualistic self-authoring, (b) macro- and meso-level structural and cultural determination, and (c) macro-meso and micro level conflation and interconnection. Based on conceptual shortcomings in the field, we develop our own fourth approach that focuses on a relational, pragmatic transactional perspective. This suggests the young person as a separated learning agent is an incorrect unit of analysis to explain intent behind action. Instead we are argue for the holistic and integrated (Deweyan) notion of &amp;quot;transaction&amp;quot; that focuses on young people being subject and subjected to conditions as much as being subjects of their conditions.</str>

    <str name="title">Navigating the Neoliberal University: Reflecting on Teaching Practice as a Teacher-Researcher-Trade Unionist</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Evans, Matthew</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article reflects upon the neoliberalisation of higher education and its effects on teaching practice. It is argued that a neoliberal discourse of teaching excellence has the effect of working against, and potentially undermining, the emancipatory potential of higher education. The article reflects upon attempts to navigate disciplinary power in the neoliberal university and considers whether critical, emancipatory praxis is possible or if complicity in, and co-option by, neoliberalism is inevitable. Ultimately, it is concluded that individual teachers have some scope to pursue approaches which counter neoliberal dominance but that this is heavily constrained. A broader, collective, project will therefore be necessary if alternative (critical, emancipatory) visions of teaching and learning in higher education are to successfully challenge neoliberal hegemony and the negative effects of this in the academy.</str>

    <str name="description">This article sets out discursive issues surrounding bullying and harassment against teachers. This problematic phenomenon of teachers being bullied by students does not have the discursive policy framework to realistically and even-handedly enable discussion in the public arena or political and policy environments. This discussion chronicles our journey towards greater conceptual clarity and appropriate nomenclature about bullying and harassing behaviours directed against teachers. International studies have identified teacher-targeted bullying by students as a real and detrimental issue for teacher wellbeing. We present a sampling of international research that grapples with the challenge of defining the phenomenon of teachers as targets of intentional bullying and harassment by students. We consider Australian studies conducted in the past twenty years that address teachers' perceptions of being bullied. Finally, we propose that this phenomenon is likely to continue until there is sufficient support to start a cultural shift towards more respectful treatment of teachers.</str>

    <str name="title">University Non-Admittance and Anomie: Reconsidering the Promise of an Egalitarian Society</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Isopahkala-Bouret, Ulpukka</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The core theme of this article is the emerging tension between the egalitarian discourse that increases the general aspiration of people to become more educated and actual admission constraints. A desire to attend a university and not being allowed to (i.e. non-admittance) is a loss that can potentially result in an anomic condition. Anomie theory gives a sociological explanation for a painful situation in which there is a cultural overemphasis on success combined with structurally limited opportunities. In this study, the focus is on the experiences of prospective students who have been applying to a selective university in Finland without gaining admission. The data consists of 50 personal online narratives. The analysis is presented in accordance with a conceptual typology of individual responses to the conditions of non-admittance. The findings yield important insights regarding university choice, meritocratic selection and formulation of equitable admission policies.</str>

    <str name="description">In this paper, we contribute to the understandings of young masculinities by turning attention to the South African schooling primary school context. In the context of scarcity of interventions around violence in the primary school, we focus on how young boys construct, negotiate and experience violence. Notwithstanding dominant discourses around childhood innocence we argue that young boys are active participants in violent gendered cultures at school. We show how boys' bodies are key sites for the enactment of violence and is especially a valuable resource in the context of food insecurity. The paper also shows the fluidity of masculinity as boys who are regarded as 'victims' can also defend and resuscitate masculinity that endorses violence. Implications for addressing young masculinities in the primary school within local context are considered in the conclusion of the paper.</str>

      <str>Squire, Ruth</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores the recent emergence of 'working-class student officer' roles in students' unions associated with elite UK universities. These student representative roles are designed to represent the interests of working-class students within their universities and sit alongside student representatives for liberation groups and/or student communities. Based on interviews with postholders and using Bourdieu's concepts of habitus and field and Reay's applications of a 'reflexive habitus', I explore how these students have come to assert a public and political 'working-class student' identity within their universities. Their commentaries reveal the 'makings of class' in a context where students are very aware of claims for recognition and the 'hidden injuries of class' and offer an insight into how working-class students are finding new ways to navigate their classed identities in HE.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">The influence of living in a disadvantaged neighbourhood on young people's transitions from education to the labour market has not received much attention in past research. This study examines the extent to which social disorganisation, understood as the level of crime experienced in the neighbourhood, can influence young people's educational and employment outcomes. It draws on data collected from Next Steps, a longitudinal nationally representative cohort of English young people. Using logistic regression and propensity score matching techniques and controlling for family background, prior educational attainment, ethnicity and gender, victimisation and risk behaviour of the young person, the results suggest that living in a disadvantaged neighbourhood increases the probability of young people experiencing Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) status at ages 16-19. Sensitivity analysis shows that these results are robust to selection bias.</str>

    <str name="description">In this paper we provide a framework for conceptualising transitions from Vocational Education and Training (VET) programmes to Higher Education (HE), by bringing together Bourdieu's and Bernstein's theoretical approaches with the view to attend to the often side-lined epistemic and pedagogical parameters. We utilise the Bourdieusian tools of field, habitus and capital to capture the relational, material and cultural aspects of HE transitions. In using a Bernsteinian lens we shed further light into how social agents acquire differentially structured and valorised knowledges and develop a sense of themselves as hierarchically positioned knowers. The metaphor of transitional frictions is utilised to capture the ongoing struggles that students with a VET background experience as they make the transition to HE. We argue for the need of widening epistemic access and putting in place enabling pedagogies that can ease these &amp;quot;transitional frictions,&amp;quot; thereby potentially increasing the chances of successful HE participation and completion.</str>

    <str name="description">In this article, we use data from ethnography-inspired studies of eight Swedish schools. We describe and analyse how a number of neoliberal-inspired economic and political processes have (re)organised social and relational practices in local school settings. There is an increased focus on individuality in the everyday working lives of teachers, where result-centred practices, relations and professional identities have replaced notions of equality and compensatory interventions. In our study, the teachers describe an increasing focus on performativity, competition and hierarchisation. We use fairness as a lens for illuminating these changes in social relations, changes in the organisation of teachers' practices, and teachers' struggles with these changes. The purpose of this study is to analyse how the current reforms are enacted and how they affect the working lives of teachers, and thereby to contribute to the current discussion on how the last decades of political and administrative changes have affected educational practice.</str>

    <str name="description">This article uses an analytical framework informed by social geographies to explore the complex relationships between Higher Education Institution, undergraduate student and place. Drawing on findings from a qualitative study exploring the experiences of college-based Higher Education students studying degree courses in Further Education Colleges in England, the article sees student subjectivities as structured through inequalities of institutional positioning in a stratified system as well as through layered local histories of industrial loss. Taken as an instance of undergraduate education in a massified and geographically unequal national context, the findings in this article offer an insight into the contradictory role played by Higher Education in its local area, particularly where a local area is defined by both a lack of and a need for increased educational opportunity.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Hindhede, Anette Lykke</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Drawing on Bourdieu's theory of practice, this paper aims to understand whether and how a reproduction of the status hierarchy of medical specialties and diagnoses occurs within a medical school in a North European context as well as students' educational strategies given the hierarchy. We report data from a cross-sectional survey conducted on a sample of Danish medical students. The 289 respondents ranked diseases and specialities, based on how they believed most health personnel would rank them. In addition, 18 in-depth interviews with medical students were conducted. Comparing the ranking responses of early, mid and late phase students, the analysis tracks the gradual convergence and broad agreement around a hierarchy. The paper concludes that medical school is a highly competitive field of higher education, where distinction is invested in and reproduced by curricular knowledge. This distinction is reinforced within wider structural elements such as governmental educational policies.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Tholen, Gerbrand</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">An ongoing debate is centred around the question of how we can understand the value of university credentials in accessing jobs. We know that occupations are strong determinants of which skills, knowledge and abilities are utilised in work but we do not know enough of how occupational contexts shape what university degrees represent to employers and labour market entrants. Drawing on semi-structured interview data, this article compares and contrasts how Higher Education degrees serve as credentials in accessing three different graduate occupations: laboratory scientists, software engineers and press officers. Rather than functioning as direct signs of work skills and knowledge, signals of trainability or as instruments of social closure, the article shows that higher education credentials serve multiple roles within the three occupations. These occupational-specific forms of credentialism shape the competition for jobs for university graduates. The article argues for a renewed theoretical approach to educational credentialism.</str>

    <str name="description">A consolidated sociological line of the research allows us to understand the educational advantages of middle-class pupils in terms of the dynamics of reproduction [Bourdieu, P., and J. C. Passeron. 1970. &amp;quot;The Inheritors: French Students and Their Relations to Culture,&amp;quot; translated and edited by Richard Nice. Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Power, S., T. Edwards, G. Whitty, and V. Wigfall. 2003. &amp;quot;Education and the Middle Class.&amp;quot; Buckingham: Open University Press]. However, some scholars have pointed out how this process cannot be taken for granted, highlighting the difficulties experienced by youths in reaching academic success [Reay, D., and H. Lucey. 2002. &amp;quot;Carrying the Beacon of Excellence: Social Class Differentiation and Anxiety at a Time of Transition.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Journal of Education Policy&amp;quot; 17 (3): 321-336. Doi:10.1080/02680930210127586]. Based on Bourdieu's perspective, this article will explore the links between low educational attainment, artistic passion, and high aspirations in privileged students. The research is based on in-depth interviews and focus groups with middle-class pupils in two secondary art schools in Milan. It is argued the artistic disposition acts within dynamics of negotiation among different and contrasting expectations. Creativity emerges as a source to perform gendered privileged learner identities. This study on artistic educational pathways can contribute to understanding the process-making of inequalities in creative fields.</str>

    <str name="description">Globally, performance-based research funding aims to support the most deserving academic institutions and researchers. However, overcoming entrenched assumptions about quality is a persistent challenge for higher education research policies worldwide; traditionally powerful institutions tend to maintain dominance. Research impact as a performance criterion presents an opportunity for position-taking through success according to non-academic criteria. Could impact-oriented research funding challenge institutional hierarchies? The UK university system presents an instructive case study for exploring this question. However, exposing the effects of such performance-based funding on institutional stratification requires focusing on the interface between institutions and disciplines. A Bourdieusian analysis of 53 cases of research-based impact on higher education policy/practice revealed the differential capital that researchers from more and less 'prestigious' universities mobilise when generating research impact. By uncovering how impact reinforces disparities in research power between UK institutions, the study contributes to understanding of sectoral reproduction through discipline-level mediation of research policy.</str>

    <str name="description">A prominent explanation of intergenerational educational inequality is Bourdieu's cultural reproduction theory. Indeed, previous studies have frequently shown that children's cultural capital relates to academic outcomes. However, it remains unclear how children convert their cultural capital into achievement. While Bourdieu argued that cultural capital influences academic outcomes primarily by biasing teachers' grades, other researchers have proposed the alternative explanation that children's cultural capital absorption directly translates into academic skills. Using survey data on 2975 fifth graders from the German National Educational Panel Study, we disentangle these two mechanisms of children's cultural capital conversion; and argue that the main conversion mechanism depends on the cultural capital dimension examined. The results of our structural equation model suggest that both mechanisms are at work and that the main conversion mechanism depends on the dimension of cultural capital examined.</str>

    <str name="description">This article shows how the Scottish Government's (SG) political management of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) has reinforced the economic goals of lifelong learning (LLL) under the skills for work agenda. Youth unemployment has been prioritized as the main social problem to be addressed, and most of the limited public resources for LLL have been targeted towards youth at risk of unemployment at the expense of the rest of the adult population. The article adopts a Cultural Political Economy perspective to examine LLL policy discourses contained in 12 policy documents published by the SG during the period between the Scottish National Party's arrival in power and the Independence Referendum (2007-2014). The analysis draws attention to the fact that the GFC has been used by the SG to legitimize selective cuts to the further education sector as well as a stronger labour market orientation within LLL provision.</str>

    <str name="description">The acquisition of cultural capital can only be understood in the light of the formation of habitus, including the socialisation process, and in the context of the field in which any such capital has value. Yet, the relation between cultural capital and habitus is seldom discussed in research. Drawing on the data from focus groups with 96 students and a survey of 5,779 students from six Singapore secondary schools, we analyze how reading as a form of cultural capital is distributed among High-SES, Mid-SES and Low-SES students in Singapore. We show how middle-class practices of &amp;quot;intensive immersion&amp;quot; in school-valued reading practices is a form of habitus that prepare some students better than others for engaged reading. The findings highlight how reading as a form of cultural capital is operationalized through students' familial habitus and argues that making visible familial habitus provides insights for transforming institutional habitus for students' reading futures.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Chen, Jiaxin</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This study explores the complexity of school resistance by Chinese rural migrant children (RMC), which may contribute to their educational failure, as well as the school conditions informing their resistance. This study categorizes migrant children's school resistance into three patterns, based on their rationale for school behaviors: conformist learner, education abandoner, and nascent transformative resister. All three groups were initially believers in pursuing academic success for upward social mobility, as promoted at school. However, some gradually determined such educational pursuit was untenable and became education abandoners. Teachers' predicting RMC's academic failure and highlighting the individual's responsibility for that failure contributed to that abandonment. While findings of this study indicate that migrant children may develop transformative resistance, this possibility is challenged by the dominant ideology of meritocracy and a teaching agenda that legitimizes social inequality.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines how young people account for choosing mathematical subjects, and how these processes sustain, or not, their continued participation. It draws on a 2-year qualitative study of 24 young people's accounts of following advanced mathematical pathways within a widening participation programme. Working within a post-structural framework, I combine two arguments: firstly, that local discourses of time, age and maturity position contemporary adolescence as a time of 'becoming' that aligns personal aspirations with mathematical progress, and secondly that students' accounts of choice and aspiration require multiple imaginings of present and future selves. I identify distinct discourses -- &amp;quot;moving/improving&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;getting ahead&amp;quot; -- that structure the intelligibility of participation in mathematics and further mathematics respectively. I argue that tracing the alignments between students' accounts of themselves and/ in mathematics offers potential to understand emergent practices in mathematics participation but also how exclusions are re-inscribed along classed and gendered lines.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Godec, Spela</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Research has highlighted that engagement with science is highly gendered and that the masculinised culture of science makes it difficult for many girls/women to engage. Meanwhile, a growing body of research has explored the potential of out-of-school spaces to provide more equitable engagement opportunities. In this paper, I examine engagement with science among working-class, self-identified 'girly' girls aged 11-13. I discuss how gender performances and engagement with science shifted across science lessons, school trips and family trips to science museums. The findings suggest that engagement with science is complex, contradictory and varies across spaces -- girls' performances of hyper-femininity supported engagement with science in some spaces, but made it difficult in others. Different spaces also afforded the girls different opportunities for performing gender, which in some instances opened up new ways for engaging with science. I conclude by discussing the implications for more equitable science education.</str>

    <str name="title">Race Matters: Confronting the Legacy of Empire and Colonialism</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Shain, Farzana</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Farzana Shain reviews two books: (1) Seeing Race Again: Countering Colorblindness across the Disciplines, edited by Kimberle Williams Crenshaw, Luke Charles Harris, Daniel Martinez HoSang and George Lipsitz, 2019; and Education and Race: From Empire to Brexit, by Sally Tomlinson, 2019, Bristol, Policy. Shain begins this review by saying that we are now entering a new period for race relations in the US and UK. What Gramsci (1971) described as the 'morbid symptoms of the interregnum', can be seen in the revival of populist politics and renewed enthusiasm for nationalist policies across a number of countries as they respond to the impact of the global crash in 2008. Immigrants, those seeking asylum and minorities were the first to be blamed for the failures of flawed neoliberal financialisation policies and the wild speculation that went with it, which most economists now agree caused the crash (Bresser-Pereira 2010; Pettifor 2017). From the UK's Brexit referendum in 2016, the Trump election in 2016, to the nationalist policies pursued by Prime Ministers' Narendra Modi in India, Shinzo Abe in Japan, Jair Bolsanaro in Brazil, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, the minority groups within each nation-state are being blamed for declining living standards. Similar trends have been identified in the Philippines, China and India and in South Africa. Across European countries, recent elections have seen a rise in support for parties that promote xenophobic nationalism, economic protectionism and anti-immigration rhetoric. There has been a shift to right populism by existing parties in order to win votes (Inglehart and Norris 2016; Dennison and Geddes 2019) in the particularly volatile and uncertain economic and political context following the global crisis of 2008, the effects of which are still continuing -- this is the 'new interregnum'. Political analyses of events such as the Brexit referendum and Trump's victory in the US election in 2016, and a number of right populist parties' performances in the European elections in 2019, have noted that a significant proportion of the electorate was motivated to vote for anti-immigration parties not only because of economic insecurity but for long standing reasons of cultural insecurity, racial resentment and a marked hostility to 'others', most notably, Muslims and asylum seekers. These sentiments are captured within the cultural backlash theory of voting behaviour. Slogans such as 'Take Our Country Back' (Brexit, UK, 2016), 'Make America Great Again' (Trump election campaign 2016), and 'Get Brexit Done' (UK General Election 2019), do not explicitly mention race but speak to the cultural insecurities of many whites through plugging into a nostalgia for the 'good old days'. In this review, Shain asks the following questions: (1) What is the cultural nostalgia for? and what role does education play in feeding it? Shain identifies these questions as at the heart of the two books under review and she discusses those questions in detail in the sections of this review that follow. She notes that the books contain many rich examples of the methods that sustain white supremacy including the operation of apparently race and power-blind discourses such as merit and opportunity. Both books speak to these decolonising movements which are still in the process of agreeing what decolonise means and how it must be achieved. Shain closes the review by saying that while neither book offers a substantive conclusion chapter, both books make an invaluable contribution to current debates at a time when the right populism is on the rise again. She states that there are, inevitably, some gaps in the books however she found them extremely timely and will no doubt be referenced widely in interdisciplinary conversations focussed on challenging new racisms in education.</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores the powerful yet contradictory role of neoliberalism, its competitive mechanisms and emotional logics. Theoretically, it reviews the shifting state-higher education-market nexus through the lens of a critical cultural political economy paradigm. Conceptually, it closely examines Davies' work on the 'logic of competition' (2014) and Naidoo's idea of 'competition fetish' (2011, 2015, 2018) to expose the material and discursive dispositifs through which nation-states, institutions and individual actors mobilize universities to position themselves in the global knowledge economy. The discussion is informed and supported by empirical evidence drawn from a doctoral project (2013-2014). The article aims to contribute to the extant critique of (higher) education by introducing the paradox of 'polarized convergence' as an instance of differentiation without diversity in the contemporary English university. Such paradox urges the re-visitation and broadening of the idea and practice of the entrepreneurial university to reinvigorate the link between competition, innovation and diversity.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores how one cohort of first-in-family students narrated their movement into and through university, proposed as a form of boundary crossing. These metaphors emerged from the stories that students told about their persistence, with references ranging from institutional or organisational boundaries through to those imposed by self and others. Applying the sensitizing lens of boundary crossing, an analysis is provided of how learners navigated their transition into university and the types of persistence behaviours adopted. The focus is on those who traversed these boundaries, considering the nature of incursions and the ways these were negotiated within students' everyday lives. This cohort all self-identified as being the first in their family to attend university but also acknowledged a variety of additional social, cultural and economic factors that impacted upon their educational journey.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This study focuses on the parental involvement among Eastern European immigrant parents of elementary school students in Canada. Interviewed parents (N + 19) were educated in several Eastern European countries and had children attending elementary schools in the province of Ontario at the time of the study. The analysis was informed by the concepts of social and cultural capital developed by Pierre Bourdieu. It was found that Eastern European immigrant parents see their role supporting children mainly in the home by emphasizing academic achievement and extracurricular activities. Despite high levels of cultural capital there was a variation in the amount of social capital available to immigrant parents. Those who managed to recreate rich social networks in the new country communicated with teachers more successfully and were satisfied with school.</str>

    <str name="description">Previous studies of citizenship preparation in upper secondary school, including studies on vocational programmes, have primarily focused on general subjects. Potential and actual roles of vocational subjects in this context have received little attention, so we have little knowledge of what is likely a significant part of the citizenship preparation that occurs in vocational programmes. Drawing on the work of Basil Bernstein and ethnographic data, this study presents an analysis of socialisation processes in vocational elements of three vocational programmes in Swedish upper secondary school. The analysis addresses the formation of pedagogic codes in various vocational programmes and subjects, and how these codes condition students' practice of citizenship at individual, social and political levels. The results show how different pedagogic codes have different implications for the students' practice of citizenship, and thus raise questions about factors and processes that may either constrain or strengthen, this aspect in vocational subject classes.</str>

    <str name="description">Meritocracy is used by governments in many societies as an 'effective' way to represent social justice and legitimise -- explain away -- class inequality. By focusing on a small number of working-class students who achieve academic 'success' and have reached elite universities in an ideal meritocratic environment -- Chinese schooling -- this paper aims to discuss the relation of meritocracy to upward social mobility and class domination. Our analysis raises questions about the notion of 'success' in a meritocratic environment and suggests the operation of a new form of symbolic domination in relation to these working-class high-achievers. Through their 'successes' at school, they are distanced from their working-class localities and histories, while they also remain outside of the middle-class sensibilities that they aspire to -- they become a 'third class' whose core values reside in meritocracy itself. There is no transcendence of class here rather a different form of distinction and exclusion.</str>

    <str name="description">In Finland, early childhood education and care (ECEC) is traditionally publicly provided. However, private ECEC provision has increased during the past decade, largely as a result of financial support from the public sector. Drawing on qualitative interviews with municipal decision-makers, this article identifies three frames within which publicly subsidised private ECEC provision and marketisation are rationalised: the pragmatic frame, the government frame and the choice frame. The results show that even though market logics and tendencies seem to have gained a strong foothold in local policies, there is a keen interest in universalism and maintaining public control over local ECEC provision.</str>

    <str name="description">The heterogeneity of the contemporary Indian middle-class has been discussed widely. However, the effect of its internal differences on the distribution of educational resources needs to be examined systematically. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with parents in 53 middle-class families in Dehradun, India, this paper explores three aspects of the home-school relationship: how socioeconomic transformations shape parents' aspirations for their children's future, educational decisions parents make to realise those aspirations, and mothers' engagement in their children's everyday schooling. The tripartite analysis reveals that despite sharing common educational goals and strategies with the population in general, middle-class families in India use their class privilege to gain valuable educational resources. The paper argues that the discrepancy in the mobilisation of accumulated resources in the heterogeneous middle-class results in disparate educational advantages across families. It critiques the binary construction of social classes when explaining the processes of social reproduction in contemporary Indian society.</str>

    <str name="description">Travel has become ubiquitous for most social groups as holidaying abroad has become ever cheaper and ecumene. This paper considers how travel can be understood as part of family practices around children's educations and futures. Drawing on Kaufmann's concept of motility, we examine how spatial mobility might become a form of cultural capital to reproduce privilege or facilitate social mobility. We generated data on family spatial mobility during the act of international air travel itself, interviewing 22 participants. We argue that spatial mobility and its link to social mobility is differently conceived of by our working, middle, and global middle class families, but that all three seek to use travel overtly as a form of cultivation for their children. This leads us to suggest that international travel may illuminate new ways that social class differentiations and lines of striation are being forged through movements across transnational spaces, offering new insights for education professionals and scholars.</str>

    <str name="description">Education research demonstrates that positive and trusting family/school relationships support academic achievement but for many Indigenous parents in Canada legacies of residential schooling have made it difficult to develop strong bonds with schools and teachers. Drawing on interviews with 69 Indigenous parents and eight non-Indigenous parents of children who identify as Indigenous from two Canadian provinces, this study explores the intersection between family/school relationships and social class, and highlights distinct ways that middle-class Indigenous parents are involved in schooling. Shifting from a &amp;quot;deficit&amp;quot; approach to a &amp;quot;strength based&amp;quot; approach highlights existing resources and capacities among those who are comfortable and familiar with navigating the education system while also creating prospects to build on that capacity to empower others who are less familiar/comfortable.</str>

Humor aids in the development and formation of the self and in the preservation of dignity and self-esteem, even though it sometimes does so through the humiliation of another. (IS)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Stromquist, Nelly P.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article is an attempt to apply a systematic use of theory to gender inequalities in education. It expands on the tenets of liberal, radical, and socialist feminist perspectives to account for differential gender outcomes in terms of educational access, attainment, and field of study choices. The State emerges as a key actor regulating and promoting educational processes and outcomes, and the perspective that most accurately captures the State's practices is socialist feminism. There has been a recent convergence in feminist thought toward the meshing of ideological and material elements in the explanation of women's subordination, bringing closer than ever the radical and socialist feminist perspectives. These perspectives detect severe limits in the State's ability to  improve women's conditions while groups outside the State, particularly women-run organizations, are identified as the most likely sources of significant educational change and thus social change, in the interests of women.

    <str name="title">Bureaucracy and Its Limits: Accountability and Rationality in Higher Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Murphy, Mark</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Alongside debates concerning managerialism, marketisation and performativity, the question of accountability in higher education has come to the fore in recent commentary. Discussion of the subject has tended to be divided into two distinct camps. On the one hand, there are strong calls for more accountability to the public purse--a desire to witness more productive returns and efficiency on investment in higher education. On the other, there are academics who rail against the oppressive, panoptican-like nature of the audit culture, emphasising the debilitating effects of quality assurance mechanisms on academic life. The paper suggests that one way out of this impasse is to place the current accountability agenda--what Travers refers to as the "new bureaucracy"--in the context of Max Weber's account of bureaucracy and rationality. Habermas' reconstructed version of Weber's work is identified as a possible means of delineating the reaches and limits of modern bureaucratic accountability.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper reports on a study of students choosing the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma over state-based curricula in Australian schools. The IB Diploma was initially designed as a matriculation certificate to facilitate international mobility. While first envisaged as a lifestyle agenda for cultural elites, such mobility is now widespread with more people living &amp;quot;beyond the nation&amp;quot; through choice or circumstance. Beck and others highlight how the capacity to cross national borders offers a competitive edge with which to strategically pursue economic and cultural capital. Beck's &amp;quot;border artistes&amp;quot; are those who use national borders to their individual advantage through reflexive strategy. The study explored the rationales and strategy behind the choice of the IB Diploma curriculum expressed by students in a focus group interview and an online survey. This paper reports on their imagined transnational routes and mobile orientations, and how a localised curriculum limits their imagined mobile futures. (Contains 2 figures and 3 tables.)</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article is a contribution to the sociology of an expanded and newly diversified UK higher education system. How differentiated is the student experience? How sharply is the system polarised? Drawing on interviews and questionnaires conducted in five sociology departments in a variety of pre-1992 and post-1992 universities, it examines students' views on &amp;quot;what they learn&amp;quot; and their orientations to study. It explores differences in curriculum content and organisation and the extent to which student narratives and identities vary with differences in institutional context. A typology of student experiences and subject engagement is advanced that as well as capturing institutional differences also locates a range of student orientations--and worthwhile student experiences--in all five departments that suggests a somewhat greater commonality of experience and outcome across institutions than the extreme polarisation of institutional experiences and outcomes sometimes suggest.

    <str name="description">This paper explores the different ways that primary school teachers in Uganda navigate the boundary between school science and everyday knowledge in the context of a centrally mandated curriculum innovation. The paper is based on a study of the pedagogic practices of 16 teachers in eight Ugandan primary schools that were selected on the basis of having a track record of either high or low academic achievement in the public primary school-leaving examination. The official primary school curriculum in Uganda prescribes that science be taught in an integrated form, including integration between science subject knowledge and everyday knowledge. The strategies that teachers in the study adopted in relating science to everyday knowledge was a key feature that differentiated between pedagogic practices in the high-performing and low-performing schools. In high-performing schools, teachers recruited everyday knowledge as a resource for learning science as a specialised discourse; whereas in the low-performing schools, acquiring everyday knowledge was viewed as an end in itself. The paper, then, considers the implications of differences in teachers' pedagogic strategies for the kinds of knowledge to which learners are given access. (Contains 2 tables.)</str>

    <str name="description">A growing body of literature focuses on choice of studies in the context of policies on widening participation in higher education and graduates' difficulties in the labour market. Drawing on research findings showing a relationship between social class and choice of studies, we conducted a qualitative study on first-year medical students in a Greek university. The research aim was to examine the seemingly paradoxical choice of medical school, given the contradiction between the great investment in time, effort and money required, and inflation of medical graduates and high unemployment levels. Apart from the impact of social class, findings suggest that choice is also strongly influenced by the broader context of the social and financial relations, and the education system. We argue that any attempts to analyse choice processes need to accommodate the specific national characteristics and peculiarities. (Contains 1 figure.)</str>

    <str name="description">Young people in jobs without training are ubiquitous but invisible, working in shops, cafes, and other low-waged, low-status occupations. Commonly elided with young people who are not in education, employment or training, they are positioned as the "thick bunch" with empty and meaningless working lives. The main purpose of the research was to explore the experiences of this group of marginalised and socially disadvantaged young people through a deeper understanding of their interests and enthusiasms inside and outside work. These young people have been (mis)understood and (mis)represented. A more holistic and nuanced approach that is not uncritically founded upon a set of neo-liberal stereotypes and assumptions, and instead recognises the complexity of their lives, would offer new opportunities for understanding and representation of their interests. Our findings challenge the conflation of identity with work and the notion that only certain forms of employment create meaning.</str>

    <str name="description">Occupational therapy pre-registration education stands at the intersection of the fields of health and social care and higher education. UK Government agendas in both fields have seen an increase in the number of students entering with non-traditional academic backgrounds, a group noted to experience particular challenges in negotiating the transition to, and persisting and succeeding within, higher education. Drawing on data from an ongoing longitudinal case study, a Bourdieuian lens is applied to exploring the early educational experiences of a group of these students during their first year of study and highlights a number of key issues, including the high-value status of linguistic capital and its relationship to understanding the rules governing practices within the learning environment, the processes via which students manage to adapt to or interestingly, to resist, the dominant culture of the field, and some of the barriers to finding a foothold and legitimate position within the new field.

    <str name="description">One popular view of student achievement is that the quality of teaching students receive plays an important part in whether or not they do well at school. In this article we draw attention to &amp;quot;context&amp;quot; as a complementary explanation, particularly regarding achievement differences between students from different socio-economic backgrounds. In making these observations, we utilise data from one Australian secondary school located in an economically depressed rural community. Drawing on the insights of Bourdieu, our focus is on the broader social and economic influences that can adversely position students and schools, as well as work to inform the institutional stance that schools take in relation to their students.

    <str name="description">In this article, using data from ethnographic research, we try to present some glimpses of the way education is described as an experience and possibility &amp;quot;from below&amp;quot;, by pupils who grow up and study in schools in the most segregated and territorially stigmatized suburbs on the outskirts of our major cities. What we feel they describe is an experience of schooling for surviving the social and economic consequences of curtailed citizenship in a post-industrial society rather than one of schooling that offers possibilities of integration and full citizenship or social transformation. Our findings have significant policy implications in this respect. Sweden has historically pursued projects aimed at educational inclusion but has recently taken a significant turn toward neo-liberalism and educational consumerism, since which time various disadvantaged groups have become increasingly concentrated compared with others in under-achieving schools in an economically threatened public sector. The article discusses some aspects and possible consequences of this development. (Contains 6 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">This paper draws on data from a research project investigating gendered identities and interactions of high-achieving students in Year Eight in England (12-13 years old), particularly in relation to students' &amp;quot;popularity&amp;quot; amongst their peers. As part of this study 71 students were interviewed from nine different schools in urban, rural and small town locations. From an analysis of participants' conceptions of the characteristics of &amp;quot;popular&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;unpopular&amp;quot; students, this paper looks in depth at notions of in/authenticity and how it is perceived and judged in relation to the self and others. In particular, the paper focuses on the genderedness of such discourses of in/authenticity as constructed by these students, and relates such concerns to theorizations of &amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot; femininity.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Gillies, Val</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines new structured attempts to address and manage emotions in the classroom. Critical analysis focuses on the broad emotional literacy agenda operating within schools, and more specifically the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) programme. Data are drawn on from an ethnographic study located in Behaviour Support Units in three mainstream, inner-city comprehensives to highlight the gap between the &amp;quot;rational emotionality&amp;quot; being promoted and the fraught, and often uncontainable, emotions that drive everyday school life. It is also argued that the therapeutic model underpinning SEAL activities in schools risks individualising and thereby misinterpreting socially and culturally embedded difference, pathologising particular pupils in the process.

    <str name="description">The perspectives of indigenous science learners in developed nations offer an important but frequently overlooked dimension to debates about the nature of science, the science curriculum, and calls from educators to make school science more culturally responsive or &amp;quot;relevant&amp;quot; to students from indigenous or minority groups. In this paper the findings of a study conducted with indigenous Maori children between the ages of 10 and 12 years are discussed. The purpose of the study was to examine the ways that indigenous children in an urban school environment in New Zealand position themselves in relation to school science. Drawing on the work of Basil Bernstein, we argue that although the interplay between emergent cultural identity narratives and the formation of &amp;quot;science selves&amp;quot; is not as yet fully understood, it carries the potential to open a rich seam of learning for indigenous children.

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Referring to the experiences of three Muslim refugee girls recently settled in Australia, this paper examines issues of schooling and empowerment. The paper draws on teacher and student interview data from a study that investigated inclusive approaches to addressing issues of cultural diversity in a secondary state high school in Queensland. The paper foregrounds the girls' highly positive views of their experiences at the school; views that reflect the girls' access to spaces of empowerment but belie the complexity and tensions involved in how empowerment was understood and approached by educators at the school. Theorising empowerment through poststructural understandings of agency, the paper examines conditions and ways of understanding that make possible spaces of empowerment for the girls. In particular, the paper argues for a reflexive approach to empowerment that is informed by an understanding of the framing discourses shaping minority student identity and a critical reflection on educator and school positionality.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Braun, Annette</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper considers the psychic and social dynamics reported by student teachers when learning to embody their teacher persona in the secondary school environment. Focusing on gender dimensions of embodiment and drawing on qualitative interview data from a UK study of postgraduate teacher-training students, teaching is examined as a physical experience. The paper conceptualises findings under two related headings: the appropriately gendered body, signified by heteronormative readings of gender and sexuality; and the gendered authoritative body, conceptualised as male. The &amp;quot;teacher body&amp;quot; emerges as an important element of student teachers' stories of trying to fit with the new professional environment and the paper concludes by arguing for a consideration of gender and body politics in the practice and training of teachers, thus challenging the assumption that professional occupations are essentially &amp;quot;disembodied&amp;quot; and gender neutral.</str>

    <str name="description">Low application rates of state school students to elite universities have been identified as a factor in their limited participation in elite universities. This article explores the role of teachers in state schools and colleges in guiding higher education (HE) choice. Drawing on qualitative research with teachers and students in six institutions, we identify differential practices that corroborate explanations of an "institutional habitus" shaping students' likely pathways to HE. However, we suggest that attention is paid to teacher habitus, demonstrating how teachers' political and ethical dispositions as well as their social capital are potential factors shaping students' decision-making about HE, and elite university applications in particular.

    <str name="description">The paper presents the argument that kindness in teaching is both commonplace yet unremarked and that, moreover, it is subversive of neo-liberal values. In arguing for the value of attending to kindness, we reject the dichotomy between emotion and reason and the associated gendered binaries. We distinguish kindness from "due care" and acts that are required of professionals, and instead locate it philosophically in personal values and with a concern for lay normativity. We illustrate our claims for the pervasiveness of kindness through a re-reading of student data from an earlier study. These data are used to elaborate the concept. We conclude by suggesting that what is subversive in thinking about higher education practice through the lens of kindness is that it cannot be regulated or prescribed.</str>

    <str name="description">While the attention of researchers has focused on video games, texting and, more recently, the growth of social networking sites such as "Bebo.com" and "Facebook", virtual worlds have emerged as a site of significant cultural and textual relevance for young people. A total of 6.2 million children aged between six and 12 years of age ventured into a virtual world in the 12 months between April 2007 and April 2008. Media and gaming industry analysts predict that by 2011 more than one-half of all children in that age group will be visiting virtual worlds regularly, going more often and staying longer. Paying attention to the kinds of online and offline practices these worlds promote in relation to identity and text is, for educators, both interesting and important. This article examines one of the most popular current sites for young girls, Mattel's "BarbieGirls"[TM]. In particular, the paper will pick up on issues of consumption and gender as a background context to a consideration of the textual practices modeled and made available in this particular virtual world.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lee, Moosung</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article discusses conceptual considerations for social capital research in education from a social network perspective. Specifically, the article raises three key conceptual issues that call for further elaboration of concepts of social capital: redefining potential resources as accessible but un-utilized sources of social capital; differentiating social capital itself from the process of social capital formation; and investigating both network orientation of resource-seekers and willingness of resource-givers. Based on these three conceptual issues, the article suggests conceptual considerations relevant to each issue for social capital research in education. (Contains 2 figures and 5 notes.)</str>

      <str>Poulet, Celia</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The increasing opening of French freemasonry to lower social classes raises the question of how individuals from different social backgrounds can be assimilated into the practice of context-independent ways of speaking and writing. I address these issues by, first, describing a selection by existing members based on the dispositions already possessed by noviciates; a replacement of social hierarchies by a masonic hierarchy; and a cumulative experience for members. Using one dimension of Legitimation Code Theory, I redescribe this process of selection and apprenticeship as being one of recognising and revealing knowers. That is to say, it focuses less on specialist knowledge than on knowers. Finally, I argue that analogical reasoning and tacit pedagogy are central to the issue of how a socially diverse population is integrated within freemasonry. This form of apprenticeship enables members who may not be oriented towards abstraction to learn to engage in the manipulation of context-independent meanings. (Contains 3 figures and 4 notes.)</str>

    <str name="title">Risky Choices: The Dilemmas of Introducing Contemporary Art Practices into Schools</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Adams, Jeff</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Contemporary art is a popular feature of the cultural landscape in the United Kingdom, and recent research has recommended introducing its practices into state education. Yet these practices are still rare in schools, and this paper argues that the many difficulties that arise from attempts to introduce them are indicative of their socially contingent character, which threatens to disrupt the ideological underpinnings of orthodox school practices. The school art projects &amp;quot;Room 13&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Teaching through contemporary art&amp;quot; are used as prominent examples of contemporary art practices that support a relatively high degree of learner autonomy within state education, yet are situated outside of government initiatives. Through these projects the paper explores the dilemmas that the participants face, which include questions of learner agency, choice and creative risk, and the effects of regulatory assessment systems upon collaboration, experiment, play and ephemeral learning outcomes. The paper concludes by examining the possibilities of encouraging these more &amp;quot;risky&amp;quot; contemporary practices in schools. (Contains 2 figures and 1 note.)</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines the links between language, social difference and political domination in the practices of parental school choice at the heart of a global city, Vancouver. Vancouver is a highly diverse city, especially in terms of language. Its inner city is replete with multiple languages whose exchange values are not equal. In this context, our case study of two elementary schools observes that white middle-class parents choose a predominantly white school--whose students are non-ESL and have a second language choice of French--in a socially and ethnically mixed inner city neighbourhood, creating a stark imbalance in the student population of local neighbourhood schools. This paper examines parents' accounts of their choices, which they rationalise on the basis of linguistic competency and differentiation from multilingual others. We draw from Pierre Bourdieu's theory of language and symbolic power and Ghassan Hage's spatial theory of nationalist practice to understand the linguistic dimension of school choice rationalisation made by white middle-class parents. In the context of these insights, we argue that the way anglophone white middle-class parents choose their children's schools is intricately linked to active processes of reproducing a &amp;quot;stratilingual&amp;quot; society in Canada.

    <str name="description">This paper tells of the social experiences of three four-year-old children with learning disabilities as they negotiate their daily lives in their homes and early education settings in England. We apply a social model of childhood disability to the relatively unexplored territory of young children and use vignettes drawn from video observation to explore the interactive spaces contained in settings with different cultures of inclusion. Using a multimodal approach to the data we show the nuanced ways in which the children enact their agency. We explore the relationships between agency, culture and structure, and argue that children with learning disabilities are active in making meaning within social and relational networks to which they contribute differently depending on the barriers to doing and being that each network presents. Thus, the paper provides an original use of the notion of distributed competence. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    <str name="description">This paper focuses on formative assessment in the field of higher education. It examines Bernstein's work on vertical discourses and knowledge structures with the view to deepening understanding of the concept of assessment &amp;quot;for&amp;quot; learning. The first part of the paper draws on Vygotsky's work on concept development and Bernstein's work on knowledge structures to explain why &amp;quot;generalisation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hierarchy&amp;quot; are central in knowledge acquisition. It then explores Bernstein's claim that, within the vertical discourse, different knowledge structures (hierarchical and horizontal) afford greater or lesser visibility of their epistemic structure, and thus of their evaluation criteria of what counts as a legitimate text. The second part of the paper investigates the ways epistemic expectations are signalled through the practice of evaluation to first-year university students in a professional education course and proposes that markers do not offer students stuffiest access to recognition rules necessary for producing legitimate texts in the future. Drawing on Maton's distinction between semantic gravity and semantic density, the paper offers an example of how markers could recast what is present in students' work to offer students access to key ordering principles in vertical discourses.

    <str name="description">The participation of children with disabilities in regular schools is too often the prerogative of education boards, who decide whether a child can learn within existing educational environments, rather than pressuring for systemic change and organization in school curricula that would grant the right of education to all children. This article looks at education as a right, as found in international agreements including the UN Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, and education as a development tool, and discusses the limits and potential in each of these frameworks. An alternative model is proposed as an approach to &amp;quot;universal pedagogy,&amp;quot; which incorporates the idea of a flexible curriculum and the development of literacy skills, accessible and applicable to students with different backgrounds, learning styles, and abilities. Qualitative data from a large study in a number of nations monitoring the rights of people with disabilities are presented to illustrate the arguments and provide the perspective of people with disabilities themselves about their experiences in schools.

    <str name="description">This article constitutes a short personal tribute to Len Barton in honour of his work and our collegial relationship going back over 30 years. It covers how Len saw his intellectual project of providing critical sociological and political perspectives on special education, disability and inclusion, and his own radical political perspectives. Len's challenges to prevailing notions of individual deficiencies of intellect, and disability as a personal misfortune, are noted, as is his profound influence on practitioners, activists, students and academics worldwide. It concludes that his goal of challenging and unsettling conventional "ways of knowing" has had wide and lasting influence and that it is imperative to understand what moral, economic and political judgements lie behind decisions to separate, segregate and exclude young people from mainstream education and their fellow citizens.

    <str name="description">This paper traces the relationship between the emergence of disability studies and the struggle for meaningful inclusion for disabled people with particular reference to the work of a pivotal figure in these developments: Len Barton. It is argued that the links between disability activism and the academy were responsible for the emergence of disability studies and that this has had an important influence on mainstream sociology and social and educational policy nationally and internationally. It is evident, however, that the impact of these developments has been only marginal and that in light of recent concerns about the global economy, environmental change and unprecedented population growth, the need for meaningful inclusion is more urgent than ever and cannot be dependent on the work of a few key individuals for its success.</str>

    <str name="description">A special issue of the "British Journal of Sociology of Education" has been devoted to an examination of Disability and Inclusive Education. The authors of the papers in this issue have all made important contributions to the advancement of knowledge and understanding in these fields of study. Overall, they have provided a comprehensive, valuable series of informed insights into a range of important ideas, issues, questions and agendas for future developments. They have also provided a relevant resource of references for readers to further explore. When thinking about any personal contributions to these concerns, the author is clearly reminded, on the one hand, of the limited nature of such work and how little effective conceptual, theoretical, empirical and applied nature of such understanding has been achieved, and, on the other, how much work still needs to be undertaken for real changes to be realised and maintained. In this brief response, the author offers a selection of concerns that have been reinforced for the author in the reading of these papers, and are part of the urgent tasks that need to be seriously and critically explored.

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Len Barton is acutely aware of the power of the academy to either enhance critical thinking or to depress it. He is a true academic, never accepting the received wisdom or perspective of any given sociological standpoint, no matter how powerful or fashionable it was at the time. He has encouraged and promoted a unique blend of professional and public sociology of education that has left a profound legacy not only in the United Kingdom but beyond. While the neo-liberal ideology had hegemonic status for most of his professional life, Len chose to engage in a counter-ideological struggle; he created new intellectual spaces in the academy where people could safely dissent from the reigning intellectual orthodoxies. He operated according to the principles of Gramscian thinking by mounting a war of position, in journals, books, teaching, conferences and research, for critical intellectuals. And he encouraged other people to do likewise. This article explores the ways in which Len's work inspired the establishment of the Equality Studies Centre and the School of Social Justice in University College Dublin. It outlines the lessons learned from Len Barton about higher education and its potential as a site for critical analysis and action. (Contains 9 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">This brief essay celebrates the work of Len Barton. Drawing from a range of his texts, interviews and presentations, the essay attempts to demonstrate the importance of Barton's work in establishing foundations for the related fields of disability studies in education and inclusive education by revealing the politics of special educational needs and the requirement for a sociological analysis of traditional special education as a force for the disablement of vulnerable students. The essay will illustrate the centrality and the particularity of the complex relationships between research, teaching, learning and activism in the thinking and work of Professor Barton.

      <str>Peters, Susan J.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores the contributions of students' voices in order to highlight some issues that have been central to disability studies--issues of identities, and their correlations to power, temporality, inclusivity, and place among the most salient to contemporary theories in the sociology of disability and education. Building on previous work that recognizes students' insights through the metaphors of street-wise philosophers, image-makers, and jazz improvisationists, I then chart a course for assessing theoretical frameworks in sociology and their applications to education, as well as to disability studies. Essentially, student voices offer opportunities for critical self-reflection as a disability studies scholar, as well as for reflection on the contributions of disability studies and sociology as a whole, leading to a transformative vision of the central tenets and tasks before us. The approach taken throughout this analysis is informed by Len Barton's call for a politics of hope. (Contains 5 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">This article charts the emergence of the sociology of disability and examines the areas of contestation. These have involved a series of erasures and absences--the removal of the body from debates on the social model of disability; the disappearance of the Other from educational policies and practices; and the absence of academics from political discourses and action. The paper considers the contribution of the sociology of disability to inclusive education and examines some of the objections currently being voiced. It ends with some reflections on the possibilities for academics within the sociology of disability to pursue alternative forms of engagement and outlines a series of duties that they might undertake.</str>

      <str>Barnes, L. Philip</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper challenges the overly positive image of the contribution made by religious education in England and Wales to the attainment of liberal educational aims that was recently presented in this journal, in the context of a review symposium on a &amp;quot;festschrift&amp;quot; celebrating the work and achievements of the influential British religious educator, Professor John Hull. An alternative reading is pursued that provides a more accurate and fair interpretation of the evidence. There is a discussion of the ideological character of British religious education and a consideration of the reasons why assertions of its &amp;quot;success&amp;quot; by religious educators are currently so vocal. Critical attention is focused on two particular issues over which the influence of Hull on contemporary policy and practice is acknowledged: that of his dismissal of the accusation that multi-faith religious education confuses pupils, and that of current strategies in religious education to promote inter-religious and intercultural understanding.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">In the United Kingdom, the introduction of the Disability Equality Duty 2006 has provided a new window of opportunity to promote the idea that education has a role to play in changing non-disabled children/young people's attitudes towards disabled people. This article explores the issues raised by the application of the Disability Equality Duty to English schools. The remainder of the article then seeks to 'map the territory' for future research into the role that education might play in challenging disabling attitudes and building an inclusive society.

    <str name="description">By drawing on interviews with administrators, faculty and staff at one school in the northeastern United States, this qualitative work considers the ways in which school leaders negotiate, resist or draw upon discourses associated with health, weight, nutrition and fitness to understand and experience their own bodies and interpret their roles and responsibilities at the school. Analysis of the narratives suggest that school leaders saw themselves as public examples from which students might resist and/or mimic (ill-)health. Further, school leaders believed that it was only through their active engagement in and display of health that they were able to effectively &amp;quot;evangelize&amp;quot; their commitment to the social project of self. Thus, while schools &amp;quot;could&amp;quot; provide an important venue for young people to experience diverse notions of health and well-being, without a school leader's knowledge of or commit to exploring these alternatives, this outcome is unlikely.

    <str name="description">Cultural capital is frequently referred to as a construct in the analysis of inequality in higher education. It has been suggested that variations in cultural capital contribute to social class differences in levels of participation, distribution of students between elite and other universities, and the likelihood of dropping out. However, recent analyses of quantitative data suggest that once students' attainments are included in analysis of levels of participation the effects of social class disappear. One possibility is that cultural capital affects the likelihood of participation in higher education independently of the common measures of social class variation (parental occupation and education). In this analysis we include a measure of students' cultural capital to investigate whether it exerts an effect on the likelihood of participation that is independent from students' attainment. We also present and evaluate a practicable method of measuring students' cultural capital. (Contains 5 tables and 4 notes.)</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Schools represent the primary setting where refugee children learn about Australian life and culture. They serve as a broad context for acculturation not only for academic development and language acquisition but for cultural learning too. This paper focuses on the after-school homework tutoring programme that uses University of Western Sydney (Australia) secondary teacher education students as tutors for African refugee students in secondary schools to facilitate their inclusion into Australian society. African refugees may receive lower returns for education in comparison with other Australian migrants. Using Bourdieu's theory of social capital and cultural reproduction as a conceptual framework, this paper discusses the part played by schools in constructing barriers that prevent under-represented groups such as refugees participating in the education process. It aims to explore the success of community engagement programmes like Refugee Action Support, which is designed to act in the interests of others (refugees) characterized as socio-culturally disadvantaged.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper describes a research project that uses Pierre Bourdieu's concepts of habitus and cultural and social capital to penetrate how middle-class parents exercise influence and form positive relationships at the neighbourhood public school that serves various ethno-cultural groups of students. One group of white, economically privileged students have populated the school since its founding; the others are new, immigrant, and diverse in ethnicity, race, and immigrant status. The parents of the former group of children enjoy active involvement in the school and trusting relationships with teachers that involves their differentiation from and exclusion of the new immigrant group. While the paper affirms the importance of social class differences in parent involvement, it integrates additional dimensions of immigration status and ethnicity. (Contains 5 notes.)</str>

      <str>McGregor, Glenda</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In western nations, the social and economic changes of the past 30 years have facilitated a reorientation of the focus of educational institutions. Global capitalism has placed education at the forefront of national competitiveness, and governments have responded with education policies primarily designed to serve the needs of the market. Such neo-liberal economic imperatives have been supported by a variety of neoconservative social forces calling for schools to become sites of cultural and moral restoration. This paper draws upon current theoretical debates about the consequences of such changes and employs ethnographic data from a small qualitative study of Australian youth to argue the case for a more democratic and student-centered approach to educational reform. It contends that in the interests of all young people, it is time for schools to resist systemic impulses to make them producers of &amp;quot;human capital&amp;quot; and claim their role as transformative institutions of &amp;quot;human possibility&amp;quot;.

    <str name="description">This article proposes that progressive frameworks underpinned by diversity are contradictory to the inclusion of the &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; in Australian higher education. I integrate the critical race theory constructs of disregard and convergence with white privilege and indigenous lacking to claim that objective processes underpinned by merit embed the marginalising of the &amp;quot;other&amp;quot;. I draw on storytelling to enunciate my subjective experience of disregard as a Maori woman scholar to shed light on institutional culture in the maintaining of insider privilege.

    <str name="description">This paper discusses the Japanese history textbook controversy over &amp;quot;comfort women&amp;quot; to tease out insights that help globalize the existing theoretical discussion of politics of school knowledge. I begin by documenting how the domestic struggles over Japanese history textbooks are empowered and dis empowered by the regional and international power relations. Using the Japanese case, I first problematize the use of hegemony in critical scholarship wherein struggles over school knowledge have been defined within the framework of a nation-state. Second, I call for situating the discussion of counter-hegemonic strategies in the increasingly internationalized politics of education witnessed around the world. In sum, this study calls for broadening the application of the notions of hegemony and counter-hegemony in critical education scholarship to take full account of the complex political dynamics of globalizations.

    <str name="description">This article argues that greater understanding of the Aristotelian concept of &amp;quot;phronesis&amp;quot; or practical wisdom would make an important contribution to the conceptualization and implementation of Recognition (Assessment) of Prior Learning (RPL/APL) in formal education contexts. However, there is a need to identify &amp;quot;phronesis&amp;quot; empirically so that RPL assessors can identify it and RPL candidates can articulate it. Extracts from the qualitative data of two separate research projects are presented to show examples of &amp;quot;phronesis&amp;quot;. These extracts also show the difficulties associated with its articulation and identification. It is argued that even if &amp;quot;phronesis&amp;quot; cannot be accredited for RPL purposes, it should be taught and discussed in the curricula of adult education and RPL portfolio development courses to show the importance of this form of knowledge and reasoning and the different forms it might assume in formal education and life contexts.

    <str name="title">Legitimacy through Alternate Means: Schools without Professionals in the Private Sector</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Quirke, Linda</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The new institutionalism predicts that professionalism is a key element of organizations' ability to be seen as legitimate. Emphasizing the professionalism and formal credentials of its members lends legitimacy to the organization, protecting it from scrutiny. What happens when this norm of professionalism is absent? How do schools legitimate themselves, if not through professionalism? This paper examines a population of small, secular non-elite private schools that overwhelmingly hire uncertified teachers. Using data from 60 private school principals in Toronto, Canada, I examine the ways in which private schools tap into alternate means of legitimacy. This study finds that small, secular &amp;quot;rogue&amp;quot; private schools fail to invoke norms of professionalism as a means to garner constituent support and legitimacy. I argue that these schools substitute an innovative, unconventional &amp;quot;caring consumer ethos&amp;quot; in place of teacher professionalism. (Contains 4 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Devine, Dympna</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper considers how first-generation immigrant children contribute to processes of capital accumulation through their negotiation and positioning in Irish schools. Drawing on the concepts of social and cultural capital, as well as inter-generational analyses of children's role in the structuring of everyday life, the paper highlights migrant children's strategic orientation to their primary schooling, positioning themselves in order to maximise the exchange value from their education. Social class, gender and ethnic/migrant status were identified as significant to the strategies adopted, and how children coped with their positioning as ethnic &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; in school.

    <str name="title">Navigating a Treacherous Game: Conceptualising Parental Engagement in Contemporary Queensland Schooling</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Macfarlane, Kym</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Parent engagement in schooling has long been held as a vital component of the successful navigation of the schooling process and, consequently, governments often invite such engagement via policy implementation. However, at times, contestation arises about parent engagement, with some parents seemingly &amp;quot;crossing the line&amp;quot; when attempting to be involved in their children's schooling. This paper investigates the possibility of parent engagement in schooling in Queensland, Australia, conceptualising it as a game of social and systemic practice. The author examines this notion using an example of contestation between parents at a regional government school and the education authority. Policy directives about parent engagement are explored, with the rhetoric of such policy applied to the example in question. The work of Bourdieu and Foucault is used to argue that the invitation to parents to engage is framed and thus often misrecognised, resulting in unintended conflictual relationships between parents and governing authorities.

    <str name="description">We draw on case-study research at a high-achieving secondary school in London to illustrate how school experiences may influence drug use and reproduce inequalities in reconstructed ways in late modernity. Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews with students and teachers, and observations. We focus in particular on the accounts of three female students expressing a shared counter-school identity and style to explore how drug use has become an important source of bonding, identity construction, coping and excitement for young women from disadvantaged families at high-achieving schools, including as part of strategies to resist the narrow focus schools can place on academic attainment, monitoring and discipline. We propose that, in late modern times, class-based counter-school cultures are being replaced with new consumer-based ones, but that secondary schools continue to act as sites for the reproduction of social stratification, as well as risk and harm relating to drug use.

    <str name="description">For the past decades international organisations and governments have promoted and implemented analogous education policies on the grounds that education is the key factor to foster development and fight poverty. This article sets the context of these educational programmes and analyses their discourse on poverty in Argentina and Chile. Then, it shows how they institutionalise strict surveillance, institutional denigration of the poor and professional scepticism. In general, the conclusions underpin one hypothesis that leads the analysis: eventually, these targeted education policies &amp;quot;pedagogise&amp;quot; poverty alleviation in that they aim to &amp;quot;instil flexible identities&amp;quot; into the poor rather than open channels for social inclusion.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">There is a large body of research in studies of schooling, particularly ethnographic case studies, which posits that collective action among students undermines engagement in school and contributes to educational inequality. In this paper I review studies of engagement from a social identity theory perspective. To what extent can collective action explain why some student groups are less engaged than others? I discuss four approaches to identifying social identity-related problems of engagement frequently used in prior research. While researchers often find problems of engagement among low-academic-status students, research on educational engagement has had difficulty locating the underlying causes of inequality in student engagement. Social identity theories of educational engagement are inherently theories of "collective action". I conclude that a fifth approach, large-scale observational studies of monitoring and sanctioning, provides the best framework for identifying both the prevalence of, and solutions to, this particular source of disengagement.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Reid, Carol</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The research discussed in this article is based on an Australian Research Council-funded study carried out over three years (2005-2007) in three states in Australia. The study sought to understand students' experiences and decisions at secondary school to ascertain why few girls choose to enter tertiary-level Communication and Information Technology (CIT) courses, and what strategies could be implemented in schools to remedy this problem. The results suggest that while boys still tend to dominate the higher levels of CIT subjects in Australian high schools across the three states, there was also a general decline in participation at all levels. Drawing on qualitative and quantitative data, the article examines patterns and explanations regarding the nature of participation in CIT subjects. The article develops a Luddite analysis in order to understand the strong rejection of this area of study in the three Australian states. (Contains 6 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores recent changes in tertiary education policy in New Zealand, which are designed to address legitimation deficits. By offering an analysis of the making, and the subsequent unmaking, of quasi-markets in tertiary education, this paper attempts to describe how the state dealt with legitimation deficits resulting from providers' of tertiary education use of the adult and community education funding category to increase their revenues. In providing this description, the paper helps to provide a way of understanding how the state in New Zealand has responded to legitimation deficits by introducing a new regime of governance. The paper concludes by arguing that, in terms of its treatment of category 5.1 funding, this regime is supportive of neo-conservative goals. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    <str name="description">Over recent years there has been growing appreciation of the body's corporeal significance in how children learn in educational settings. "The body" has been conceptualised from a variety of perspectives that we characterise as: "the body without flesh", "the body with fleshy feelings" and "the body made flesh". We reflect on these perspectives with reference to the model of embodied action used in our ongoing research on relationships between education and disordered bodies, outlining what they might differently offer in terms of understanding body/mind/culture relationships. We suggest that Basil Bernstein's notion of the "pedagogic device", when reworked around the concept of a "corporeal device", may provide one way of better conceptualising such relationships avoiding some of the fault lines and dualistic thinking inherent in other perspectives. If, as sociologists or school practitioners, we are to address the agency of "the body" in cultural reproduction and better understand how the corporeal realities of children influence their sense of position, value and self, then we will need to deal with both the "physical" and the "phenomenal" universes of discourse, and the "somatic mediations" of lived experience. This will mean giving as much attention to the biological dimensions of embodiment as its discursive representation currently receives. (Contains 1 figure and 7 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines the effect of school social class composition on pupil learner identities in British primary schools. In the current British education system, high-stakes testing has a pervasive effect on the pedagogical relationship between teachers and pupils. The data in this paper, from ethnographic research in a working-class school and a middle-class school, indicate that the effect of the &amp;quot;testing culture&amp;quot; is much greater in the working-class school. Using Bernsteinian theory and the concept of the &amp;quot;ideal pupil&amp;quot;, it is shown that these pupils' learner identities are more passive and dominated by issues of discipline and behaviour rather than academic performance, in contrast to those in the middle-class school. While this study includes only two schools, it indicates a potentially significant issue for neo-liberal education policy where education is marketised and characterised by high-stakes testing, and schools are polarised in terms of social class.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Ingram, Nicola</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article contributes to the theory of institutional habitus by exploring the differing ways in which the institutional habitus of two schools in Belfast, Northern Ireland mediates the local habitus of working-class boys. All of the boys in this qualitative case study live in the same disadvantaged working-class community but attend two different schools, depending on whether they succeeded or failed in an examination at the age of 11 years. It is argued that these schools have different mediating effects on the boys' common habitus. While most studies of working-class boys focus on underachievement, and most studies of working-class success focus on females, this article draws together the strands of success, failure, working-class boys and locality, and examines the ways in which identity is constructed and reconstructed in response to schooling. Questions are raised about the interpretation and/or misrecognition of working-class culture in schools and within the wider discourses of society.</str>

    <str name="description">To date, scholarship on international students has generally focused on flows from non-western economies to the main English-speaking destination countries (such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia). In contrast, we draw on a qualitative study of 85 UK students who have either completed or are considering undertaking a degree programme overseas. We found that, in opposition to a common image of &amp;quot;international students&amp;quot;, UK students are not overtly motivated by &amp;quot;strategic&amp;quot; concerns. Instead, they are seeking &amp;quot;excitement&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;adventure&amp;quot; from overseas study and often use the opportunity to delay the onset of a career and prolong a relatively carefree student lifestyle. Despite these ostensibly &amp;quot;disinterested&amp;quot; objectives, however, UK students remain a highly privileged group and their experiences serve only to facilitate the reproduction of their privilege. The paper calls for a more critical analysis of the spatially uneven and socially exclusive nature of international higher education. (Contains 3 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">Professional discourse in education has been the focus of research conducted mostly with teachers and professional practitioners, but the work of students in the built environment has largely been ignored. This article presents an analysis of students' visual discourse in the final professional year of a landscape architecture course in Brisbane, Australia. The study has a multi-method design and includes drawings, interviews and documentary materials, but focuses on the drawings in this paper. Using the theory of Bernstein, the analysis considers student representations as inter-relations between &amp;quot;professional identity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;discretionary space&amp;quot; for legitimate knowledge formation in landscape planning. It shows a shift in how students persuade the teacher of their expanding views of this field. The discussion of this shift centres on the professional knowledge that students choose rather than need to learn. It points to the differences within a class that a teacher must address in curriculum design in a contemporary professional course. (Contains 1 note, 2 tables, and 10 figures.)</str>

    <str name="description">While research into educational inequalities emphasizes childhood socio-economic status, this study adds another dimension of status into the analysis; namely, the child's own social position among its peers. The aim was to examine whether socio-economic status and peer status can both be linked to educational transitions and, if so, whether they constitute overlapping paths. In a second step of analyses, the relationship between peer status and adult unemployment was investigated. Data were derived from a longitudinal study using a 1953 cohort born in Stockholm, Sweden. Our results suggest that children with higher socio-economic status and children with higher peer status are consistently more likely than their lower status peers to proceed to the next level of education, and that the effects of socio-economic status and peer status hardly overlapped at all. Furthermore, educational differences by peer status seem to involve consequences for the studied subjects' contemporary labour market opportunities. (Contains 4 tables.)</str>

    <str name="description">Cultural capital, originally a general sociological concept, has been transformed into a construct that is often applied in predicting scholastic attainment. Intellectual ability (IQ) has also been proven to be a strong, although basically psychological, predictor of educational attainment. However, these strands of research have hardly been contrasted in terms of their predictive power and in terms of their potential interaction. In the current study of Slovenian secondary school students, the results indicated that both constructs had statistically significant predictive power, both as to attainment and as to transition into type of secondary education. Results also indicated that: both constructs were fairly robust, as their predictive power remained statistically significant even after control variables were entered into the model; and they operated independently as results indicated no interaction between these constructs. The &amp;quot;return&amp;quot; on cultural capital was greater for students whose parents had lower educational status. (Contains 4 tables.)</str>

    <str name="description">In this paper I discuss two weaknesses in Bourdieu's work on cultural capital, both of which are related to his integration of the multidimensional nature of social space in different domains of life: social mobility, lifestyle differentiation, and political orientation. First, there is an anomaly between the work on social mobility and on lifestyles. Multiple dimensions of social origin (cultural and economic capital) are related to uni-dimensional outcomes (e.g. schooling levels), whereas it would be more appropriate to study multidimensional schooling outcomes too. Secondly, although Bourdieu sees a close resemblance in the type of resources affecting lifestyle preferences and political orientations, I argue that these outcomes are affected by two different types of resources: cultural and communicative resources. Proposals for progress, including a review of the empirical results supporting these, are given. (Contains 2 notes and 3 figures.)</str>

    <str name="description">With reference to capital theories and rational choice theory, this paper aims to understand how abilities and schooling ambitions are intertwined with social class, gender and ethnicity. By drawing on 16 in-depth interviews carried out with highly educated second-generation Turks in the Netherlands, the paper discusses the resources, opportunities and educational attitudes of young people, together with the role of the school system and that of teachers in perpetuating ethnic inequalities in schooling, with special emphasis on gender differences in schooling ambitions.

      <str>Bodovski, Katerina</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">A large, nationally representative database of American elementary school students was used to quantitatively assess the complex ways in which race intersects with social class, affecting parenting strategies that in turn produce various educational outcomes among children. The determinants and consequences of parental practices associated with middle-class families--what Lareau terms "concerted cultivation"--among White and African American students were examined. The findings reveal that cultural differences in child-rearing occur along class, race, and gender boundaries. (Contains 3 notes, 4 tables, and 1 figure.)</str>

    <str name="description">The reviews of papers for refereed journals are rarely a source of exhilaration, only occasionally a pleasure and frequently dispiriting. Using peer reviews of research containing Chinese concepts, this paper explores different ways of thinking about knowledge, its evaluation and transfer. Bourdieu's concepts of fields of power, position taking, positioning and honour provide a framework whereby peer reviews are positioned as integral to scholarly argumentation. They are used to test efforts to connect Chinese ideas into the global dynamics of research-based knowledge, and to teach early career researchers about how to engage in academic disputation.

    <str name="description">This paper examines Initial Teacher Education students' experiences of participation in health and physical education (HPE) subject department offices and the impact on their understandings and identity formation. Pierre Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, field, and practice along with Wenger's communities of practice form the theoretical frame used in the paper. Data were collected using surveys and interviews with student-teachers following their teaching practicum and analysed using coding and constant comparison. Emergent themes revealed students' participation in masculine-dominated sports, gendered body constructions, and repertoires of masculine domination. Findings are discussed in relation to their impact on student-teachers' learning, identity formation, and marginalizing practices in the department offices. Implications for teacher education and HPE are explored.</str>

    <str name="description">In recent years, a &amp;quot;cultural turn&amp;quot; in the study of class has resulted in a rich body of work detailing the ways in which class advantage and disadvantage are emotionally inscribed and embodied in educational settings. To date, however, much of this literature has focused on the urban sphere. In order to address this gap in the literature, this paper focuses on the affective evaluations made by teachers employed in rural and remote Australian schools of students' families, bodies, expectations and practices. The central argument is that moral ascriptions of class by the teachers are powerfully shaped by dominant socio-cultural constructions of rurality that equate &amp;quot;the rural&amp;quot; with agriculture.

    <str name="description">Conceptualizations of the self in relation to others are examined among a group of young women attending a fee-paying school in England. As part of a larger study exploring intimacy and agency among young women from relatively privileged class backgrounds, 54 young women participated in focus group discussions and interviews. Findings reveal that young women strongly positioned themselves in relation to &amp;quot;others&amp;quot;--both those they saw as &amp;quot;chavs&amp;quot; and young people attending state schools. Yet, just as often, these young women sought to distinguish themselves from other private school peers. Within the privileged bubble the young women inhabited, locations within the wider private school network, type and extent of parental wealth, and fame were all markers used to differentiate the self from others.</str>

    <str name="title">The Socio-Political Significance of Changes to the Vocational Education System in Germany</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Kupfer, Antonia</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper explores the effects on social inequality in Germany of ongoing changes to the employment system and, thus, vocational education. Results based on an examination of the literature indicate that students from increasingly middle-class backgrounds with higher levels of general, rather than vocational, educational attainment are winning the competition for ever-fewer apprenticeships. Progress for women in education is accompanied by relative declines in men's performance on high school exit examinations and does not translate into success in the employment system. Employers are abandoning the corporate-state organization of vocational education. The paper concludes that school degrees are increasingly important for later career opportunities. As a result, the educational system is increasingly stratified, contributing to social inequality in Germany.</str>

    <str name="description">This article is a product of in-depth research in &amp;quot;Yaffa, The Arab Democratic School&amp;quot; that was carried out in 2004/05, as part of a study on alternative Arab education in Israel. Its aim, beyond telling the story of Yaffa, is to explicate the motivations that underlay this initiative, and to examine parental choice amongst the disadvantaged. We ask how the Arabs' parental choice is affected by their (marginalized) social location, by how far they are from the dominant culture, and by their (in)capacity to make a difference. Apparently, to make a choice is a multidimensional act, reflecting the Palestinian citizens' resistance to their marginalization and unwillingness to be subjugated through non-democratic educational perceptions. Their positionally resonates in Yaffa, as an act of intervention, and their search for an alternative reality where democratic education is not and cannot be separated from the Palestinian citizens' need to imagine themselves as Arabs.

    <str name="description">A growing body of empirical studies indicates the educational benefits of bilingualism. Despite this tendency, bilingual minority students are being pressured by school authorities to shed their mother tongues. We conducted qualitative interviews with Turkish-bilingual and native-monolingual students in Flemish (Belgium) secondary schools to investigate how students evaluate their languages, how Dutch monolingualism is imposed, and how students respond to the dominance of monolingualism. Our results indicate that the mother tongues of bilingual students are mainly perceived as a barrier to educational and occupational success, while the benefits of bilingualism are unknown. Thus, both Turkish-bilingual and native-monolingual students approved of speaking one language. We also found that monolingualism was strongly imposed on students by explicit encouragement, formal punishment when bilinguals speak their mother tongue, and exclusion of foreign languages from the cultural repertoire of the school. These results are discussed as they relate to policy-makers, scholars of bilingualism and institutional racism. (Contains 1 table and 4 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">One key aspect of the growing policy emphasis on educational inclusion in England has been the tendency for physical education (PE) to be used as an important vehicle of social policy targeted at promoting the inclusion of young disabled people and those with special educational needs in mainstream schools. Drawing on aspects of figurational sociology, the central objective of this study is to examine the extent to which PE teachers have been able to achieve the government's inclusion policy goals articulated in the 2000 National Curriculum for Physical Education (NCPE) for England. The findings indicate that using the NCPE as a means to pursue the government's educational inclusion policy goals has had unplanned outcomes that have the effect of undermining the extent to which the government is able to use inclusion to make a greater contribution to the promotion of young people's experiences of PE. It is also argued that these outcomes that no-one had planned or intended may, for some of the groups involved, be seen as undesirable consequences that emanate from teachers' attempts to manage the contradictory pressures brought about by pursuing the priorities of government.

    <str name="title">Success and Failure in Secondary Education: Socio-Economic Background Effects on Secondary School Outcome in the Netherlands, 1927-1998</str>
    <arr name="author">

    <str name="description">In the Netherlands, educational attainment is the result of a sequence of separate educational transitions. Because of the tracked nature of the Dutch educational system, students do not make binary stay-or-leave-decisions at each transition. After having entered one track of secondary education, students can change tracks during the entire secondary course. The initial track and the secondary school outcome therefore are incongruent for a significant proportion of the Dutch students. As social background partly predicts initial track placement, track changes and successful termination of the course, we suggest distinguishing conditional and unconditional effects of family background in the transition to secondary school outcome. This paper complements findings of previous research by taking into account the tracked structure of the Dutch educational system and the entire sequence of transitions in secondary education. For the empirical analysis, repeated cross-sections from the Family Survey Dutch Population (1992, 1998, 2000 and 2003) are used. Multinomial logistic regressions reveal that inequality in the outcome of secondary education is partly explained by the fact that initial track placement is socially selective and because this initial inequality is even enhanced by track changes during secondary education. The remaining &amp;quot;conditional&amp;quot; effect of parental education, however, indicates that parental education works on top of this selection to prevent drop out. Inequality in secondary school outcome thus is a cumulative result of social background effects in a sequence of educational transitions throughout secondary education. Decreasing inequality over time is entirely explained by decreasing inequality in the transition from primary to secondary education. (Contains 2 figures, 6 tables and 7 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>David, Alex Hugh</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Schools in areas of concentrated disadvantage tend to have below-average attainment, but there is no consensus on why. Mental and behavioural disorders in children are correlated with socio-economic disadvantage. This paper puts forward the hypothesis that the first phenomenon can at least partly be accounted for by the second phenomenon through the concept of &amp;quot;collateral impact&amp;quot;--collateral impact refers to the effect of externalizing or internalizing behaviour by a pupil on other pupils' learning and attainment. The argument developing the hypothesis is presented. An analysis of where evidence to support the hypothesis is most likely to be found identifies primary schools in areas of concentrated disadvantage, although testing of the proposed hypothesis would best be conducted by independent researchers to pre-empt questions of confirmability. Potential implications for policy and practice are discussed, particularly managing difficult group behaviour in primary schools. (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Day Ashley, Laura</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper contributes to arguments for the potential of Giddens' structuration theory in educational research. It illustrates how &amp;quot;conceptual schemes&amp;quot; from structuration theory were applied to the author's empirical research on a type of alternative educational practice in India, &amp;quot;private school outreach&amp;quot;. It shows how Giddens' concepts of &amp;quot;social system&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;structure&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;agency&amp;quot; helped to conceptualize private school outreach, and how &amp;quot;constraint&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ontological security&amp;quot; offered explanations of apparent contradictions in private school outreach practice within the context of the reasons and motivations of actors. It also argues that when schools attempt to do things differently, contradictions may occur because the same &amp;quot;rules and resources&amp;quot; that are drawn on in the production of alternative practice are drawn on in the reproduction of practice. Finally, acknowledging the debates around structuration theory, some of its key criticisms are addressed in relation to the empirical application. (Contains 1 table.)</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">The study examines teachers' attitudes and experiences regarding home-school cooperation. Teachers constitute a powerful group in school compared with parents, and this relationship is interpreted through Bourdieu's concept of social field, as a power relation. The empirical analyses are based on a mixed-methods approach with survey and qualitative interviews among teachers in Norway. The results show that while teachers experience the interaction in a positive way, they try to limit parents' influence through emphasising their own professionalism, thus leaving parents with the role as supporters. Teachers who relate to well-educated parents are especially conscious of maintaining a distance towards the parents in order to keep them in their place. (Contains 4 tables.)</str>

    <str name="description">This paper investigates what happened in one Australian primary school as part of the establishment, use and development of a computer laboratory over a period of two years. As part of a school renewal project, the computer laboratory was introduced as an &amp;quot;innovative&amp;quot; way to improve the skills of teachers and children in information and communication technologies and to lead to curriculum change. However, the way in which the laboratory was conceptualised and used worked against achieving these goals. The micropolitics of educational change and an input-output understanding of computers meant that change remained structural rather than pedagogical or philosophical.</str>

    <str name="description">This article responds to criticisms, put forward by Harrison and Waller in this issue, of an earlier paper by Noble and Davies. In particular, we argue that our interpretation of earlier quantitative research is correct, that Harrison and Waller have misconstrued the purpose of our previous paper and the analysis it contains, and that they (mis-)attribute to us a series of propositions and standpoints that are not in our paper. In the light of increasing policy interest in the extent to which providing information can lead to &amp;quot;more well-informed choices&amp;quot; about participation in higher education, we remain of the view that researching the role of cultural capital in the students' &amp;quot;immanent choices&amp;quot; is a matter of considerable importance.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper presents research on the returns to tertiary education for individuals who graduated between 1997 and 2008 with bachelor degrees from universities and polytechnics in New Zealand based on their experiences post study. It examines data on their post-study earnings drawn from two longitudinal datasets linking administrative data on individuals' tertiary education records to their earnings. An advantage of this research is that it reports on differences in the earnings of those who studied in specific fields of study at polytechnics and universities. The data are used to help shed light on the importance of reputational capital in reproducing social classes. (Contains 4 notes, 3 tables, and 2 figures.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Daniels, Harry</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper is concerned with the way we understand and investigate the relationship between human functioning and social setting. The central argument draws on the work of Bernstein and Vygotsky. A novel approach to the study of the mutual shaping of human action and institutional settings is developed and an empirical example of its application is presented and discussed. The research reported here is drawn from a four-year ESRC-TLRP-funded study of professional learning in and for interagency working in children's services in England.

    <str name="description">This paper offers a response to a recent article where the authors argue cultural capital is the only determinant of the propensity of young people to seek to enter higher education, dismissing other indicators such as social class. This response questions the support the original authors draw from other literature and offers criticism of the sample used in their study, the survey tool employed, the analysis undertaken and their conclusions relating to the agenda of &amp;quot;widening participation&amp;quot;. In reality, the wider literature suggests that social class, as represented by parental occupation, continues to have a role in explaining educational trajectories, even once other factors are controlled for.

    <str name="description">This paper explores whether and in what ways young people's perceptions and experiences of higher education (HE) can facilitate the transmission within their social networks of social capital both upwardly (from child to parent) and horizontally (from sibling to sibling), and thus can potentially provide bridging capital to family members, especially in families with little or no prior experience of HE. It utilises data from a project that explored the embedded nature of decision-making about HE amongst a group of &amp;quot;potentially recruitable&amp;quot; adults and their wider networks. The study researched 16 networks, and the resultant sample of 107 individuals included six teenagers and 15 young people in their twenties. The paper concludes that, despite the general emphasis within existing theoretical approaches to network capital on the &amp;quot;downward&amp;quot; transmission of social capital, the educational experiences of younger generations can be critical in shaping the perceptions of other (including older) network members, albeit not always in ways that encourage formal educational participation.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Archer, Louise</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper discusses findings from a small-scale empirical exploration of the views, experiences and educational practices of middle-class minority ethnic families in the United Kingdom. It draws on semi-structured interviews conducted with 36 parents, pupils and &amp;quot;young professionals&amp;quot;. Analyses consider to what extent generic class resources, as identified by the US work of Lareau, are evident within the educational practices of British middle-class, minority ethnic families. It is argued that generic class resources and practices were evident to the extent that parents expressed a desire for personalised education, felt comfortable voicing their opinions and concerns to schools, and were willing to climb the ladder of authority to get their voices heard. However, it is also argued that &amp;quot;race&amp;quot; plays a significant and complicating role that calls for a qualification (but not a negation) of Lareau's theorisation.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Thompson, Greg</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Current educational practice tends to ascribe a limiting vision of the good student as one who is well behaved, performs well in assessments and demonstrates values in keeping with dominant expectations. This paper argues that this vision of the good student is antithetical to the lived experience of students as they negotiate their positionality within complex power games in secondary schools. Student voices in focus group research nominate six rationales of the good student that inform their "performances" of the good student. Understanding the multiplicity and dynamism of the good student is an educational imperative as schools seek to meet the changing needs of society in the new millennium.(Contains 1 note.)</str>

      <str>Christie, Hazel</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper offers an interpretation of the role of emotions in understanding the transitions that young people make to university. I draw on qualitative research with a group of non-traditional students, entering elite universities, to argue that youth transitions are emotional as well instrumental affairs. I argue that choice-making processes incorporate both trust in, and fear of, the transitions infrastructure, and that these emotions infuse more instrumental judgements about the economic benefits of higher education. I also demonstrate that emotional aspects of class--including feelings of entitlement to education and the rejection of normative student identities--constitute the experience of &amp;quot;being&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;doing&amp;quot; a student. A broader understanding of how young people become university students then depends not just on developing a new identity but on the complex interaction between emotion and infrastructure.

    <str name="description">This article shows how the dialogic approach adopted by some schools in Spain generates a shift in approaches to gender violence, an issue still not explored in the literature. The shift is from an approach determined mainly by female experts to a dialogic one in which all women, including teachers, mothers, students, sisters, stepsisters, friends, and volunteers, are involved in designing and implementing programmes to prevent gender violence. An analysis of data obtained from six primary schools in Spain shows how the voices of all women are relevant to identify situations of gender violence that girl pupils are experiencing, as well as in the design of school-based processes to prevent violence that affects these girls.

      <str>Dahlstedt, Magnus</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In Sweden, calls for partnership between state institutions and local communities punctuate discussions of a number of areas of public policy. In this article, the discourse of partnership is analyzed in recent developments in Swedish educational policy, and particularly the involvement of &amp;quot;immigrant parents&amp;quot; as partners collaborating with the school. In the article it is argued that, in partnerships between the school and &amp;quot;immigrant parents&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;rules of the game&amp;quot; are most often dictated by one of the partners (i.e. the Swedish school). Here, &amp;quot;immigrant parents&amp;quot; are by various techniques being &amp;quot;measured&amp;quot; and exhorted to adapt to an imagined &amp;quot;Swedish normality&amp;quot;, in order to become a &amp;quot;responsible&amp;quot; parent and equal partner.</str>

    <str name="description">Rejecting notions of &amp;quot;creativity&amp;quot; as self-realisation through free expression, this article argues that such discourses currently driving education policy comprise intellectual technologies for the production of student subjectivities required by neoliberal contexts. Using a governmentality framework, it locates the conditions of possibility for the creative subject within dominant policy articulations of the global knowledge economy and emerging rationalities of risk and uncertainty. The analysis focuses on an industry school partnership formed by a state education system in Queensland, Australia, and several multinational corporations. It examines how the partnership has emerged as a novel neoliberal space for the constitution of new education figures such as the enterprising teacher and the entrepreneurial student-worker. These subjectivities are functional to the devolved governing strategy of social investment, which seeks to achieve a broad reconstitution of relationships between students, schools and industry in Queensland.

    <str name="description">This paper employs Foucauldian theory to consider Islamic boarding school experiences in Indonesia. For some pupils &amp;quot;the spirit of education&amp;quot;--a dimension of pleasure--comes to be highly valued, creating a lifelong passion for the pursuit of knowledge. Two school principals (both &amp;quot;pesantren&amp;quot; [Islamic boarding school] graduates themselves) articulated strong commitment to the &amp;quot;spirit of education&amp;quot;. Yet their respective boarding schools were very poor, not only by western standards but compared with Indonesian public schools, and conditions were austere. The embodiment of &amp;quot;pesantren&amp;quot; discourse as high academic achievement is illustrated by the example of Khadija--a young female &amp;quot;pesantren&amp;quot; graduate now studying at doctoral level in the United Kingdom. Explaining the embodied production of the 'spirit of education' demands looking at charismatic pedagogy, strict rules, austere conditions and sparse provision of learning resources as regimes of truth and power-knowledge relations that inhere in &amp;quot;pesantren&amp;quot; as lived experiences of pupils.

    <str name="description">Drawing on data derived from two socially contrasting primary schools in Durban, this paper focuses on how gender and sexuality feature in the teaching and discussion of HIV/AIDS. A detailed analysis of two &amp;quot;life-skills&amp;quot; lessons in the two schools shows that, despite the social differences between the schools, discussions of gender and sexuality remain muted. Discourses of childhood innocence make it difficult for teachers to provide comprehensive knowledge of sex, sexuality and gender in the primary school &amp;quot;life-skills&amp;quot; lessons. Implications for teacher training are suggested briefly in the conclusion. (Contains 2 notes.)</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This is a retrospective study tracing the longer term effects on identity and aspiration of white working-class boys from an area of high social deprivation. The boys were members of an acclaimed boys' dance company and have been retrospectively interviewed as young men in their twenties. Documentary and film material dating from the time they were 14 year olds and the film &amp;quot;Billy Elliot&amp;quot; were used in the interviews. A media discourse driven by a view of boys &amp;quot;in crisis&amp;quot; that is blind to social class and the difficulties faced by some girls was uncovered. This is found to pervade the entire &amp;quot;Billy Elliot&amp;quot; discourse, which focused on the sensation of a boy performing ballet rather than on the class background and historical context of the miners' dispute. The paper questions the discourse of laddishness and the social identity that is attached to the term &amp;quot;lad&amp;quot;.</str>

    <str name="title">University as Vocational Education: Working-Class Students' Expectations for University</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lehmann, Wolfgang</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Labor market conditions, a pervasive public discourse about the benefits of higher education, and parental hopes push many young working-class people into university. The institutional culture and demands of university, however, often remain elusive and fraught with uncertainty. In this paper, I draw on qualitative interviews with first-generation, working-class students at a Canadian university to analyze the ways in which these students discuss their reasons to attend and their expectations for university, and the implications of their attitudes for their future success at university. Analysis of the interview data shows how the relatively high and risky investment of working-class youth in education leads to strong utilitarian and vocational orientations toward university. Although a narrow focus on the career potential of university is generally perceived as problematic, I argue that it may also help working-class students in their transition to university. Nonetheless, a critical educational process is necessary that not only helps working-class students achieve their educational and occupational goals, but also understand their unique status in a social institution that they entered as outsiders.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Mastekaasa, Arne</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Despite strong trends in most Western countries towards gender equality in educational attainments, men are still considerably more likely to obtain doctoral degrees. Using data comprising nearly all students graduating from Norwegian universities during 1981-1996, separate event history analyses are carried out of recruitment to and completion of doctoral studies. Multilevel models are used to take both differences among individuals and among educational fields into account. With regard to &amp;quot;recruitment,&amp;quot; a moderate gender difference is partly accounted for by men's higher grades. Children have no impact for either gender. The remaining gender difference could be due to discrimination, but the fact that this difference is not larger in predominantly male fields is an argument against this. There is no overall gender difference in completion probabilities. Men, however, seem more likely to drop out of their studies in applied fields, probably due to attractive opportunities in the non-academic labour market.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Morrison, Keith</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines similarities and differences between structuration theory, habitus and complexity theory, as theories of social change. The paper suggests that structuration theory and habitus can theorize change, but that complexity theory offers a more complete theory of change because it focuses on social production rather than reproduction. Although there are elective affinities between structuration theory, habitus and complexity theory, nevertheless there are important differences between them. Complexity theory, being at heart a theory of change and development, differentiation and open systems, is more than merely a reformulation of structuration theory and habitus, and offers a more complete theory of social change than these two. Implications and agendas are drawn for the sociology of education from a complexity perspective.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">The rapid modernisation process of Greek Cypriot society has created a cultural environment with an amalgam of traditionalist and modernist ethical attitudes, and antagonisms between them concerning, among other things, social advancement. These have implications for the way individuals and families develop various strategies of choice-making for post secondary school destinations and for issues of social justice. We focus on social capital networks and resources. Our arguments are supported by the analysis of attitudes, beliefs, practices and resources available to a sample of 24 Greek Cypriot parents for choice-making about the educational and occupational futures of their children. In discussion we offer modelling of these processes plus, more speculatively, implications for the possible emergence of a transcendent postmodernist cultural recontextualisation of social capital practices in contemporary Cyprus and for the ethics of social capitalism more generally.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Hope, Andrew</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The introduction of Internet access into over 30,000 UK schools has led to the adoption of a variety of disciplinary policies, procedures and practices. Critically engaging with writings on panopticism, this paper explores the surveillance of student online activity. It is noted that Internet surveillance in schools includes control through physical observation and limited use of computer databases. For from being passive subjects of observation, some students actively resisted surveillance through physical concealment, virtual concealment and &amp;quot;sousveillance&amp;quot;. Noting that an often-ignored feature of panopticism is entertainment, it is suggested that student resistance of Internet surveillance is best understood in terms of play and the desire to test authority.</str>

    <str name="title">Evidence-Based Practice in Educational Research: A Critical Realist Critique of Systematic Review</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Clegg, Sue</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The paper argues that a critical realist perspective can contribute to a critique of evidence-based practice, while at the same time not abandoning the idea of evidence altogether. The paper is structured around a number of related themes: the sociopolitics of "evidence-based"; epistemological roots and a critical realist critique; the debate in action based on the recent systematic review of personal development planning; and theory to practice gaps. The advocacy of evidence-based practice is currently being used to undermine professional autonomy and to valorise the "gold-standard" of randomised controlled trials. However, the paper proposes that evidence can properly be claimed for critique and emancipatory projects, and that its current discursive location at the core of New Labour thinking is not the only one available. Moreover, thinking from a critical realist perspective liberates the space for theoretically informed work, whereby arguments about method, and in particular randomised controlled trials, do not become a proxy for the open examination of ontological and epistemological assumptions. One of the underlying themes in critical realism is that of critique and emancipation, and evidence properly understood aligned to clear theoretical argumentation is part of this project. Existing models of systematic review fall far short of this aspiration and are of little help to practitioners. As researchers and practitioners we have every reason to maintain a critical stance towards the way evidence is being deployed in debates about policy and practice.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines claims that recent reforms to UK education have led to significant organisational changes in primary school and higher education. It also examines two main theoretical explanations for these, namely post-Fordism and New Managerialism. Examples of changes in both schools and universities, including flexibility and teamwork, are explored. Up to the mid-1980s, publicly funded educational organisations did display bureaucratic features, including rules, staff hierarchies and complex procedures. However, professionals employed in these organisations retained discretion and autonomy in their work. Since then, the introduction of an audit culture and a greater emphasis on management and regulation of the work of teachers and academics has decreased discretion and autonomy. This paper suggests that theories of New Managerialism offer a more satisfactory explanation of the changes explored than post-Fordism, which has more often been used as a normative model of what contemporary organisations should look like.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Martens, Lydia</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The market as educator has become firmly lodged at the centre of popular and scholarly debate commenting on the nexus between children, consumption and education/learning. In this paper, I appreciate this scholarly debate from the point of view of the sociology of consumption. The latter has been relatively silent on children's consumption and education, focusing instead on adult learning. Nevertheless, I here draw on that sociology to forward an argument that favours consideration of a broader range of social relationships and cultural and contextual influences. I outline two models on the network of relationships that inform children's consumption, and illustrate, through a discussion of Chin's Purchasing Power, how children's consumption-related learning may originate from outside the market. The paper finishes with a plea for more research that focuses on children and the domestic contexts of consumption.</str>

    <str name="title">The Body and Pedagogy: Beyond Absent, Moving Bodies in Pedagogic Practice</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Ivinson, Gabrielle</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Following the corporeal turn in social theory, this paper explores how the body is implicated in pedagogic practice and leaning. Focusing on the body has usually been recognised as part of the regulative rather than instructional discourse in schools. Work has begun to redress the mind-body imbalance through the "corporeal device" developed from Bernstein's "pedagogic device", the fundamental relay through which social inequalities are reproduced in schools. To properly recognise the way bodies act as pedagogic relays requires a robust understanding of persons as multi-sensorial acting beings. Examples for choreographic pedagogy are used to illuminate the complex and multimodal features of instructional discourse and to suggest how the moving body could be enlisted to enhance students' access to formal academic discourses and better understand why some young people fail to achieve in schools.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lehmann, Wolfgang</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">As their numbers at university grow, we need to gain a better understanding of the different ways in which working-class students negotiate their potential outsider status in what is often considered an essential middle-class institution. Based on data from a four-year longitudinal, qualitative study of working-class students at a Canadian university, I argue that their acceptance of the ends and means of both the academic and social demands of university contributes to the development of different student roles, which in turn affects their likelihood to succeed academically. Drawing on works by Bourdieu and Bernstein, I present four case studies of students who lived through university committed, alienated or in transition toward either commitment or alienation. I show that despite similar working-class backgrounds, study participants' reaction to university was anything but predictable. Instead, prior socialization, clear and realistic career goals, and chance encounters at university played an important role in their approach to university life.

      <str>Davey, Gayna</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Especially in research on the &amp;quot;classed practice&amp;quot; of educational decision-making, it is striking how the Bourdieuian concepts of habitus and capital have dominated. With a tendency to focus on the middle-classes' ability to accumulate and deploy cultural capital, less attention has been given to the role of the educational institution and its place in the field. This article draws from interviews and field notes taken from time spent within a fee-paying school in the south of England. I argue that the school and parents are engaged in the production, display and consumption of cultural capital. Through Bourdieu's notion of &amp;quot;doxa&amp;quot; we gain an understanding of how the school and parents negotiate a very particular classed practice. (Contains 3 notes.)</str>

    <str name="title">Exploring the Heterogeneity of Class in Higher Education: Social and Cultural Differentiation in Danish University Programmes</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Thomsen, Jens Peter</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines the relationship between social background, choice of university programme and academic culture among Danish university students. Statistically and sociologically, university students are often treated as a homogeneous group, but the ever-increasing number of students in higher education demands a closer examination of the hidden heterogeneity in the students' social origin and educational strategies. Using a mixed-method approach (register data and ethnographic observations and interviews) the paper focuses on the students' class origins and on different cultural practices in three Danish university programmes. It is shown that the Danish university field is characterized by a significant variation in social selectivity from programme to programme, and it is argued that these different social profiles correspond with distinctively different cultural practices in the programmes. Correspondingly, the students have distinctively different strategies towards education and future work life. (Contains 7 notes, 1 table, and 1 figure.)</str>

    <str name="title">The Unintended Hegemonic Effects of a Limited Concession: Institutional Incorporation of Chinese Schools in Post-War Hong Kong</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Wong, Ting-Hong</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Using the case of Chinese schools in post-Second World War Hong Kong, this paper explores the unintended consequences of an incomplete hegemonic project. After World War II, anti-imperialist pressures and rising educational demands in the local setting propelled the colonial authorities to be more active in providing and funding Chinese schools. This development created a considerable number of vernacular institutions that were either directly state-run or generously government-financed. Nevertheless, this concession was circumscribed because the regime eschewed universal and compulsory education, and many Chinese schools remained private and unaided. Producing three different types of vernacular institutions, the state's partial incorporation of these institutions unwittingly divided these schools and pre-empted them from forming a united, antagonistic identity. These findings urge us to examine carefully, when using Gramsci's concept of hegemony, the extent of compromise the powerful have actually conceded. They also hint that hegemony should not be conceived only as a conscious, conspiratorial project, for state practices occasioned by conjunctural forces may produce unintended consequences that have profound repercussions on political power.

    <str name="title">Is There Any Chance to Get Ahead? Education Aspirations and Expectations of Migrant Families in China</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Koo, Anita</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In China, there is a growing group of &amp;quot;migrant children&amp;quot;, who reside in the city but do not have full rights to access education. Many have been granted a chance to study in public schools after the policy change, but they continue to have lower educational outcomes than the local students. To understand the inequality, this paper examines the educational goals of migrant families in Beijing. Based on the field interviews, it shows that even migrant children who aspire to attain higher education are nonetheless &amp;quot;blocked&amp;quot; by discriminatory examination laws and limited resources. Their subjective outlook is derived from objective conditions and concrete experiences. Their family of origin determines the types of resources available to them, and thus plays an important role in the formation and justification of their educational goals. A realistic assessment of their chances of achieving their aspirations leads them to have lower expectations.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Skelton, Alan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores the impact of quality assurance and enhancement initiatives on teacher identities in higher education. Data from an interview-based study of a research-led institution in the United Kingdom are drawn upon to consider the implications of quality--for example, whether it has captured the inner assumptive worlds of higher educators (and supplanted their own understandings of quality) or whether it has opened up new subject positions and possibilities for change. I focus on a particular group of people within the article--those who have demonstrated an interest in higher education teaching by participating in professional development programmes. Such programmes have proliferated in the light of the quality movement whilst offering exposure to &amp;quot;educationalist&amp;quot; discourses. Contextualising the work through previous critical higher education research, I consider the group's perceptions of quality initiatives and the construction of their teaching identities within a research-led institution.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper provides a critical appraisal of approaches to reflexivity in sociology. It uses data from social network research to argue that Archer's approach to reflexivity provides a valuable lens with which to understand how people navigate their education and career pathways. The paper is also critical of Archer's methodology and typology of reflexivity as "types"; it is argued that social network research suggests people reveal different approaches to reflexivity in different situations. It concurs with Archer that the concept reflexivity is central to our understanding of the relationships between agency, structure and social change.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper reconstructs prevalent academic discourses of student plagiarism: moralism, proceduralism, development, and writing/inter-textuality. It approaches the discourses from three aspects: intention, interpretation and the nature of the academic community. It argues that the assumptions of the moralistic approach regarding suspect intention, the transparency of interpretation, and the homogeneous nature of the academic community are in effect sustained by discourses of proceduralism and development. This results, first, in the simplistic rendition of student identities as honest/dishonest, and, second, in the proposal of or acquiescence to the triad of prevention, detection and punishment. The paper concludes that radical re-conceptualization of plagiarism may only be discovered in the discourse of inter-textuality where intention, interpretation and the academic community are construed as social practices concerning the negotiation of various identities and values--those of students as well as those of academics.

    <str name="description">This article deals with the discourses and practices employed by families involved in school choice processes in the city of Barcelona (Spain). It draws upon a study conducted by the authors in 2008/09, and it is based on surveys completed by a representative sample made up of 3245 families, as well as 60 in-depth interviews with families with children at the age of commencing universal pre-primary education (three years old). Firstly, the article focuses on the types of concerns and pressures that families experience when choosing a school for their child. Secondly, we analyse the level and type of knowledge that parents have at their disposal about the field of school choice, as well as how they use and benefit from available information channels. Finally, we identify three unequal positions in which families find themselves when negotiating the field of school choice: &amp;quot;maximising&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;guaranteeing&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;displaced&amp;quot;. These positions are, in turn, directly related to families' locations in the social structure, which are also unequal. (Contains 3 notes, 4 tables and 1 figure.)</str>

    <str name="description">This article outlines the findings of an Economic and Social Research Council-funded study exploring the role of English state primary schools in promoting positive attitudes towards disabled people. Data emerging from a survey of schools and interviews with teachers are presented. The article considers progress made by schools against particular aspects of the Disability Equality Duty 2006. The project was underpinned by a working model of anti-disablist education resulting from a &amp;quot;conversation&amp;quot; between various models of anti-oppressive education and disability politics. It explores the rationale for a &amp;quot;courageous&amp;quot; form of anti-disablist education, definition of this, schools' engagement in this type of practice and challenges to promoting such an ideal.

    <str name="title">The Past Is All before Us: The History of Education in Hard Times</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Jones, Ken</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In this article, the author explores these questions--from what position, with what focus, and through what methods can a history be produced that is sensible of the conflicts and passions of its own time, and that can illuminate those of the past?--estimating that the books under review in several ways invite such a demanding reading. Gary McCulloch argues for a history that illuminates the past and present of education, attuned to, although not limited by, a record of struggle against &amp;quot;deep seated cultural values and social interests&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;The Struggle for the History of Education,&amp;quot; 66). Philip Gardner's book has at its heart the understanding that &amp;quot;there is no such thing as a historical consciousness that is itself placed above history&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Hermeneutics, History and Memory&amp;quot; 2010, 29, quoting Grondin). Likewise, Jacques Ranciere's new preface to &amp;quot;Proletarian Nights: The Workers' Dream in Nineteenth-Century France,&amp;quot; entertains the idea that &amp;quot;present forms of capitalism&amp;quot; render his work, first published in 1981, even more &amp;quot;untimely&amp;quot;, in the sense that the text is in frontal collision with the accepted verities of the age. In their destruction of social solidarity and creation of precarious forms of employment, &amp;quot;new forms of capitalism&amp;quot; are bringing into being &amp;quot;experiences of work and forms of life that may well be closer to those of the artisans of the past than that of the world of non-material work and frenetic consumption whose complacent picture we are offered&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Proletarian Nights,&amp;quot; xi). More is involved, for all three writers, than the study of the past for its own sake. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Crossouard, Barbara</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Cultural theorists have illuminated how photographic images contribute to autobiographical remembering and identity formation. This has new significance given that digital photography now allows personal images to circulate rapidly amongst peer groups. Taking these insights into classroom contexts, this paper draws on recent case-study data to explore a teacher's use of digital photography to provide "feedback" to pupils. Critiquing dominant psychological understandings of classroom assessment for their lack of recognition of power relations, it takes up post-structuralist theories of discourse, embodiment and affect to consider how these digital photographs became "sticky" with memories of peer derision, "mortifying" pupils and marking them as "other" in ways that were intensified through later display to the class. Thus, rather than providing benign support for learning, the circulation of these images as part of feedback processes in this classroom context seems to have functioned as a powerful technology of individualization and normalization.</str>

    <str name="title">Cultivating the Myopic Learner: The Shared Project of High-Stakes and Low-Stakes Assessment</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Allen, Ansgar</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper argues that, despite the obvious and important differences between high-stakes and low-stakes assessment, there remain important points in common. These manifest themselves at a sociological level, where each tradition of assessment shares a similar disposition towards power. It is argued that both high-stakes and low-stakes assessment, as they are practised in England today, act together in support of a wider regime of power. This regime relies upon the construction of specialised subjectivities, defined by a myopic and self-perpetuating concern with individual progression. (Contains 2 notes and 2 figures.)</str>

    <str name="title">Boys Do Not Benefit from Male Teachers in Their Reading and Mathematics Skills: Empirical Evidence from 21 European Union and OECD Countries</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Helbig, Marcel</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The prevalence of women in the teaching profession has been claimed by various scholars to be responsible for the low school performance among boys. Based on this claim there have been widespread calls for increasing the share of male teachers as a means of improving boys' school performance. There is, however, very little empirical evidence supporting the claim that boys do in fact benefit from being taught by male teachers. Drawing on data from the 2007 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and the 2006 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study, this paper examines the relationship between teacher gender and boys' and girls' respective school performance in a sample of 146,315 elementary school students from 21 countries. It finds that boys do not benefit from being taught by male teachers, neither in mathematics nor in reading. In some countries, however, girls seem to profit from being taught by female teachers.

    <str name="description">Previous international research has shown that educational goals are fundamental for explaining differences in the educational attainment between individuals. For a better understanding of educational inequality, it is therefore crucial to know more about the mechanisms leading to different expectations. Our paper contributes to this field of research by empirically testing how social networks affect educational expectations of mothers for their children. Furthermore, we try to disentangle the underlying mechanisms by investigating which role resources and attitudes within social networks play in influencing educational expectations. We use quantitative data gathered in three federal states in Germany. The key results indicate that network composition not only has an effect on educational expectations but also on general attitudes towards education. Both attitudes towards education and embedded resources seem to mediate the effect of social ties on educational expectations. (Contains 3 tables, 4 figures and 11 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">The focus of this article is the tenure review process in Canadian universities, a rigorous and high-stakes evaluation of junior academics that serves as a prime exemplar of &amp;quot;disciplining academics&amp;quot;, our project's title. In-depth interviews in seven Ontario universities with 30 knowledgeable informants such as senior managers and faculty association personnel provide the data. Literature on tenure and the persistence of equity issues suggests that we might expect some concern on those grounds to be raised by participants, especially as the faculty complement slowly grows more ethnically diverse and more gender balanced. Although not usually raised without direct questions, some discourses around equity did appear in the interviews. We argue that apparently equal outcomes in the tenure review process may be obscuring differential experiences of evaluation that need further examination. (Contains 12 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Jonasson, Charlotte</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In extant research, the concept of student engagement refers to individual behavioural patterns and traits. Recent research indicates that engagement not only should be related to the individual but also should be anchored in the social context. This ethnographic field study of students and teachers in a Danish vocational education and training school responds to the need for more knowledge on this theme by exploring the social dynamics of engagement perceptions. Results show that teachers and students held diverging perceptions of student engagement that rested on educational goals as well as goals related to the perceived future work settings. The misrecognition of the students' perception of engagement had direct negative consequences for student performance and school attachment. The implications of the findings are discussed in detail.

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Recent research has shown that racism towards Muslims has significantly increased both in the USA and in the United Kingdom. Following the 9/11 attacks in the USA, discrimination and racialised violence has shown a significant increase against those from Muslim groups. This article reviews four texts that examine aspects of Muslim identity in current society, focusing on discourses of racism, Islamophobia and discrimination. They focus on issues in the United Kingdom and the USA and are key exemplars of the Global North. They examine these aspects by exploring how a social justice agenda can be reached either through an inclusive pedagogy or by understanding how Muslim identities would be affected by this. The commonality of the texts stems from the notion that they are all (in their own ways) arguing for an inclusive and social justice agenda in relation to exploring aspects of religious identity for Muslims in education. All texts recognise the difficulties associated with aspects of inclusion and how it can be incorporated into the teaching of religion for a greater aspect of understanding of religion as well as a way of increasing tolerance between different religious groups.

    <str name="description">This paper reports on qualitative data that focus on the educational strategies of middle-class parents of Black Caribbean heritage. Drawing on Bourdieu's key concepts of habitus, capital and field, our focus is an investigation of the differences that are apparent between respondent parents in their levels of involvement with regard to schools. We conclude that, within a broadly similar paradigm of active involvement with and monitoring of schools, nuanced differences in parental strategising reflect whether academic achievement is given absolute priority within the home. This, in turn, reflects differential family habitus, and differential possession and activation of capitals. (Contains 8 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">In this article, I develop a new conceptual framework, a new thinking technology, for understanding the bullying that takes place between children in schools. In addition, I propose a new definition of bullying. This new thinking technology reflects a shift in focus from individual characteristics to the social processes that may lead to bullying. The social approach theorises bullying as one of many reactions to particular kinds of social insecurity. The concepts I develop include &amp;quot;the necessity of belonging&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;social exclusion anxiety&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the production of contempt and dignity by both children and adults&amp;quot;. I also draw on Judith Butler's concept of abjection. In the last part of the article, I employ Karen Barad's theory of agential realism, focusing specifically on her concept of &amp;quot;intra-acting enacting forces&amp;quot;. The entry to the theoretical development is based on empirical data generated in Denmark during a comprehensive five-year study of bullying. (Contains 7 notes.)</str>

    <str name="title">Playing under Surveillance: Gender, Performance and the Conduct of the Self in a Primary School Playground</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Richards, Chris</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article offers interpretations of play, in a school playground, where adult regulation and surveillance framed its enactment. Children, well aware of being watched, negotiated this through various forms of play, circumscribed by, but also playing with, adult supervision. The children were also subject to the rules governing particular age cohorts and both age and gender figured significantly in the patterns of play observed. The article argues further that, with a strong institutional emphasis on the divisions of the school day and of playtime itself, children also learnt the habits of shifting--from participation to non-participation and between modes of self-conduct. They thus became accustomed to the demands of frequent emotional and behavioural transitions and to the rhythms of the school's organisation of time. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Green, Elizabeth</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper asserts that the religious assumptions of Christian academies need to be fully examined in relation to any analysis of their cultural practices, impact or policy implications. It proposes that Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, cultural capital and symbolic power can be broadened out from their traditional use in accounting for social positioning in order to explore the interaction of religious faith and institutional culture. The emergent analytical framework outlined relies on series of theoretical tools drawn from Bourdieu whose social theory and concepts are already employed extensively in sociology of education research and studies of religion.

    <str name="title">Medical Students and Patient-Centred Clinical Practice: The Case for More Critical Work in Medical Schools</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Donetto, Sara</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In the last two decades, undergraduate medical education in the United Kingdom has undergone several important changes. Many of these have revolved around a paradigmatic shift from &amp;quot;paternalistic&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;patient-centred&amp;quot; approaches to healthcare. Adopting a Foucauldian understanding of power and borrowing from Freire's critical pedagogy, in this paper I draw upon ethnographic data from one UK medical school to illustrate the recurrence among medical students of narrow and uncritical understandings of patient-centred practices. These understandings highlight a tension between the ideals and frameworks of medical education policy and students' conceptualisations of professional learning and practice. I explore this tension by tracing some possible links between students' views of patient-centredness and the teaching practices at the medical school. I argue that more critical approaches to medical learning are sorely needed and suggest some directions for medical education that would help support the personal and professional development of more critically aware practitioners.</str>

    <str name="description">This article presents the authors' review of &amp;quot;Globalizing education, educating the local: how method made us mad,&amp;quot; by Ian Stronach. In the opening chapter of their highly influential 1997 book &amp;quot;Education Research Undone: The Postmodern Embrace,&amp;quot; Ian Stronach and Maggie MacLure draw upon the work of Derrida to argue for practices within which openings are recognised as dependent upon closures and &amp;quot;vice versa&amp;quot;. In other words, rather than working within the binary logic of either-or, educational researchers could work with a deconstructive sensibility wherein there is a narrative space of meaning-making for the reader as well as the writer of research. In &amp;quot;Education Research Undone,&amp;quot; the text at times reflexively plays at its own textuality in a somewhat maddening way. Stronach continues this knowing writerliness in &amp;quot;Globalizing Education, Educating the Local.&amp;quot; He is writing as if the text is performative and there is a narrative space for meaning-making by the reader. There is also an interest in how this space is enacted. But he is also definitively arguing that method has made one mad, writing about the world, telling individuals what is going on. The authors argue that Stronach is capable of displaying the ways in which his own arguments can then be turned against his own writing.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Rogers, Chrissie</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article presents the author's review of three books: (1) "The irregular school: exclusion, schooling and inclusive education," by Roger Slee; (2) "Confronting obstacles to inclusion: international responses to developing inclusive education," edited by Richard Rose; and (3) ""Hanging in with the kids" in tough times: engagement in contexts of educational disadvantage in the relational school," by John Smyth, Barry Down and Peter McInerney. All three books reviewed here implicitly or explicitly address humanity, human differences or being human in one way or another. The author contends that this may be why two of the three books highlight Martha Nussbaum's works, and suggests a level of understanding and enquiry that goes beyond the school and to thinking about inclusion as a broader political and ethical project. What is also apparent in all three books is an engagement with community, relationality, care and ethics. The books together are a global picture and are all presented differently. They are calling for a more creative and encouraging space for children and young people to learn in. In addition, education of all children and young people needs reform globally. All three books demand care and trust where educational leadership is inspirational and student voice is heard.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Wang, Li</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The aim of this paper is to build a capability-based framework, drawing upon the strengths of other approaches, which is applicable to the complexity of the urban-rural divide in education in China. It starts with a brief introduction to the capability approach. This is followed by a discussion of how the rights-based approach and resource-based approach can supplement the capability model; this framework is then employed to draw out new insights regarding the case of urban-rural inequality in China. It concludes by highlighting the contribution of this framework in terms of mapping out the interlocked processes that create the urban-rural divide in education by taking account of children growing up under the influence of a wider socio-economic context. In doing so, it sheds light on issues which tend to be otherwise overlooked. (Contains 1 note, 1 table, and 6 figures.)</str>

    <str name="title">Aspiration for Global Cultural Capital in the Stratified Realm of Global Higher Education: Why Do Korean Students Go to US Graduate Schools?</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Kim, Jongyoung</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This study aims to understand Korean students' motivations for studying in US graduate schools. For this purpose, I conducted in-depth interviews with 50 Korean graduate students who were enrolled in a research-centered US university at the time of the interview. In these interviews, I sought to understand how their motivations are connected not only with their family, school, and occupational backgrounds, but also with the stratification of global higher education. Theoretically, this paper attempts to combine the concept of global positional competition with Pierre Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital in the field of global education. By critically examining a push-pull model of transnational higher education choice-making, this study situates Korean students' aspirations in the contexts of global power and the hierarchy of knowledge-degree production and consumption. After analyzing the students' qualitative interviews, I classify their motivations for earning US degrees within four categories: enhancing their class positions and enlarging their job opportunities; pursuing learning in the global center of learning; escaping the undemocratic system and culture in Korean universities; and fulfilling desires to become cosmopolitan elites armed with English communication skills and connections within the global professional network. Based on this analysis, I argue that Korean students pursue advanced degrees in the United States in order to succeed in the global positional competition within Korea as well as in the global job marketplace. As they pursue advanced US degrees, Korean students internalize US hegemony as it reproduces the global hierarchy of higher education, but at the same time Korean students see US higher education as a means of liberation that resolves some of the inner contradictions of Korean higher education, including gender discrimination, a degree caste system, and an authoritarian learning culture. Therefore, this study links Korean students' aspiration for global cultural capital to complex and irregular structures and relations of class, gender, nationality, and higher education that extend across local, national, and global dimensions simultaneously.

    <str name="description">This article starts from the puzzle that although French elite institutions enjoy extremely positive and attractive images, students from these schools generally choose to conceal their academic pedigree in their daily interactions. We show that, in a context of growing inequalities of access to &amp;quot;grandes ecoles,&amp;quot; the strategy of hiding one's student identity may be understood as the desire to avoid six core threats associated with declaring one's association with an elite school: not conforming to group norms, confirming a negative reputation, not living up to a positive reputation, reducing one's identity, losing control of one's identity, and threatening the identity of the other. The conclusions highlight the implications of this microsociological study on a host of much wider questions useful in better understanding the ambivalent relations that exist between French society and its elites issued from the &amp;quot;grandes ecoles.&amp;quot; (Contains 7 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">This paper uses reports from 13,000 Grade Nine pupils in five countries to examine issues such as whether they were treated fairly at school, trust their teachers and adults in wider society, are willing to sacrifice teacher attention to help others, and support the cultural integration of recent immigrants. Using such reports as &amp;quot;outcomes&amp;quot; in a multi-stage regression model, it is clear that they are largely unrelated to school-level pupil mix variables. To some extent, these outcomes are stratified by pupil and family background in the same way for all countries. However, the largest association is with pupil-reported experience of interactions with their teachers. Teachers appear to be a major influence on young people's sense of justice and the principles they apply in deciding whether something is fair. The paper concludes by suggesting ways in which schools and teachers could take advantage of this finding. (Contains 8 tables.)</str>

    <str name="description">Using data from a large-scale survey of Norwegian youth, the study examines the relationships that the performance in key academic subjects and aiming for higher education have with political socialization at home. The more often adolescents aged 13-16 talk with parents about politics and social issues, the better their performance is and the more often they aim for higher education. These relationships survive controls for, &amp;quot;inter alia,&amp;quot; parental level of education and other socio-economic status indicators. The findings fit longstanding ideals in the philosophy of education. It is argued that a widened concept of &amp;quot;home background&amp;quot; is needed in the sociology of education.

    <str name="description">This article provides a vision of school disciplinary strategies as provided by childhood school memories of practicing or unemployed teachers. This narrative approach allows us to understand the school and its daily routines and rituals from an insiders' point of view, drawing upon the double perspective teachers employ when reflecting on their own experience as school children. The results of the study demonstrate a wide range of disciplinary practices coinciding with a Foucauldian disciplinary structure--a system of micro-penalty governing time, activity, behavior, speech, the body, and sexuality. Analyzing the systemic regulation of bodies in schools can uncover institutional meanings and make them available for questioning, perhaps even negotiation. Recognizing the ways in which teachers' roles are inextricably bound with the disciplinary power relations of their institutions can help alleviate frustration and burnout and help teachers make more informed pedagogical decisions.

    <str name="title">Cultural Capital and Agency: Connecting Critique and Curriculum in Higher Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Clegg, Sue</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper explores some of the unresolved tensions in higher education systems and the contradiction between widening participation and the consolidation of social position. It shows how concepts of capital derived from Bourdieu, Coleman and Putnam provide a powerful basis for critique, but risk a deficit view of students from less privileged backgrounds. These students are more likely to attend lower-status institutions and engage with an externally focused curriculum. The paper argues for greater attention to agency, and community and familial capital, in conceptualising the resilience of those from less privileged backgrounds. While the recognition of &amp;quot;voice&amp;quot; is important, a curriculum that acknowledges the context independence of knowledge is essential if these students are not to be further disadvantaged.</str>

    <str name="description">If managerialism points to the ideological foundations and bureaucratisation of contemporary education, marketisation signals its commodification, image and exchange. This paper brings to bear the prevailing influence of marketisation on education. It begins with a brief description of the European context and development of learning outcomes, and outlines the (economic) rationale for their existence. It then sets out to explore the logic of learning outcomes, asking: what is lost in the process of education being exchanged as a commodity? We argue that marketisation, through its constituent concepts of commodification, image and exchange, seduces as an education &amp;quot;spectacle&amp;quot; and ultimately shapes individuals' value positions. In essence, marketisation, grounded in contemporary neoliberal economics, privileges quantitative, at the expense of genuinely qualitative, educational substance. Further, we argue that learning outcomes are a simulacrum: like other signifiers of commodities, they appear meaningful (although they do exhibit meaning) but are ultimately incapable of delivering what they promise: transferable skills, at most, but not education. Ethical consequences are stark and signal the loss of the intrinsic value of education - a loss that begins with its own commodification. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">The prestige accorded to standard language varieties, particularly within the field of education, together with language management role of schools with respect to the variety and the extent to which linguistic differences construct discontinuous relationships between the school and specific social groups provide the rationale for this paper. This qualitative study, based on a friendship focus group design, was conducted with two groups of 12-year-old children from contrasting &amp;quot;ideal type&amp;quot;, socio-economic groups over the period of one school year. Findings outline specific practices where the linguistic expectations and demands within school-space create different implications and outcomes for middle-class and working-class children as a result of their linguistic experiences in non-school space. The implications of these linguistic interactions on patterns of engagement with the school among the children in the sample are also considered. (Contains 2 notes and 1 figure.)</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Global and national agendas to improve the &amp;quot;quality&amp;quot; of Education For All have brought focus to pedagogic processes in developing country contexts. How can development research pay attention to the social and political significance of pedagogical projects and understand the micro-processes of classroom reform? This paper considers how Basil Bernstein's sociological theories helped develop a nuanced account of pedagogic reform in a study of Indian primary education. I explore how the analysis encouraged by Bernstein's concepts of recontextualisation and educational codes may contribute to current thinking on the role and significance of pedagogy in development research and evaluation activities. The paper also raises caution about the selectiveness and limits of efforts to capture, identify, measure or assess pedagogic processes and change. A Bernsteinian research approach is not immune from producing the kinds of reductionist accounts of pedagogy of which the analysis is wary. (Contains 3 notes and 2 tables.)</str>

    <str name="description">This article presents an in-depth analysis of two commemoration events in a first-grade classroom of a bilingual school in Israel. The two events presented--the commemorations of the Holocaust Day and the Memorial Day--derive from a longitudinal ethnographic study of integrated bilingual schools in Israel. The analysis of these events shows teachers' and students' ambivalent emotions about the Other, as a result of pedagogical efforts to engage with the work of mourning in integrated classrooms, while attempting simultaneously to promote mutual respect and understanding. We further argue that ambivalent emotions in the context of integrated schooling bring to the surface serious concerns about symmetry and asymmetry; such concerns reveal elements of the emotional risks and benefits as a result of bringing children from conflicting groups closer. The implications for teaching and learning in integrated school settings of conflict-ridden societies are discussed. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    <str name="description">Based on interviews with and questionnaires completed by upper secondary school pupils (n = 27) from academic and vocational programmes, respectively, the present paper focuses on some of the social and individual conditions that precede the individual decision-making process in education transitions. The paper shows that an organic view of decision-making is in better accordance with observations than is a hierarchical view, and thus supports previous research claiming that pragmatic rationality (based on habitus and reflexivity) plays a more important role in students' decision-making processes than does instrumental rationally.

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper is about mothering an intellectually disabled child identified with special educational needs. It specifically looks at the parent partnership rhetoric that has dominated UK government policy and directives for nearly three decades and yet research suggests parents and more often mothers have to battle to be recognised as legitimate experts. This paper engages with sociological analysis as it highlights via qualitative narratives that mothers are weighed down by the sheer number of professionals involved in their day-to-day life. Moreover, mothers whose children are not identified in the early years are often blamed in the first instance for playing a part in their child's difficult behaviour. This research ultimately suggests that partnership work is important and necessary for practice within health, education and social work professions, not least of all because the emotional roller-coaster that mothers experience during the assessment and statementing process is disabling.</str>

    <str name="description">This article considers some of the ways in which the transformative power of Web 2.0 digital technology is reconfiguring learning, knowledge and academic identities in the contemporary university. Through a focus on five specific examples, we consider the impact of virtualization processes on spatiality, materiality and embodiment, and pedagogic relations. We argue for the benefits of taking a microsociological approach in order to reflect on the potential of virtualization to bring about new geographies of knowledge production and as a means to identify the ways in which potential transformations are uneven, problematic and contested.

    <str name="title">Distancing to Self-Protect: The Perpetuation of Inequality in Higher Education through Socio-Relational Dis/Engagement</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Keane, Elaine</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper explores the social class-differentiated behaviours of access and traditional-entry students, based on a three-year constructivist grounded theory study with 45 undergraduates at an Irish university. The participant groups behaved significantly differently within the socio-relational realm, engaging in various forms of distancing behaviours motivated by a desire to self-protect and based on perceived relative social positioning. The paper illustrates some ways in which both disadvantage and privilege are performed at the post-entry stage in a widening participation context. It is argued that the &amp;quot;closure&amp;quot; behaviours of class-based groups constrain the building of social capital by working-class students, thus potentially limiting the ability of widening participation policies in achieving equality goals.

    <str name="description">The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the changes that took place in school mathematics knowledge for pupils aged six and seven (first grade of Greek elementary school) and its pedagogical approach, which took shape following the reforms of the mathematics curricula in 1982 and 2003. Our analysis is based on Bernstein's theoretical framework on pedagogic discourse and Dowling's theoretical framework on textual domains. The results showed that there are differences between the 1982 and 2003 reforms, in terms both of the content of mathematics knowledge, as well as of the forms of pedagogic interaction between the teacher and the pupil.

    <str name="description">This paper analyses qualitative interviews conducted with Norwegian middle-class parents. It explores how a particular type of intimacy--an &amp;quot;enriching intimacy&amp;quot;--is produced as part of everyday parent-child interactions and considers the notion of the social self that spurs middle-class parents to seek this very type of intimacy with their child. By so doing it adds to the growing field of research on middle-class parents' child-rearing strategies and the role these strategies play in the &amp;quot;resourcing&amp;quot; of middle-class children. The relevance of the dimension of intimacy for studies on the parental effect on children's school achievement is discussed. (Contains 3 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Boado, Hector Cebolla</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper explores the prospective transition of immigrant and native students in France from lower to upper secondary school. Because they are more likely to be tracked to less prestigious (vocational) tracks, immigrant and immigrant-origin students are significantly disadvantaged at this key academic stage in comparison with the children of native families. Primary and secondary sources of educational disadvantage are explored to explain this phenomenon. Primary effects appear to account for the entire initial disadvantage, while secondary effects could have a positive impact for immigrant-origin students. Nonetheless, immigrant families appear to be more conservative than native families and may need stronger evidence that their children will succeed in upper secondary school.

    <str name="title">From Sociological Fictions to Social Fictions: Some Bourdieusian Reflections on the Concepts of "Institutional Habitus" and "Family Habitus"</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Atkinson, Will</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper expresses serious reservations regarding the increasingly popular Bourdieu-inspired notions of "institutional habitus" and "family habitus" in education research. Although sympathetic to the overall theoretical approach and persuaded of the veracity and importance of the empirical findings they are used to illuminate, it argues that, from a Bourdieusian point of view, they actually present several difficulties that threaten not only to overstretch and reduce the explanatory power of the French thinker's concepts but to stifle analysis of the kinds of struggles and complexities that both he and, somewhat contradictorily, the researchers in question spotlight. Bourdieu had his own ways of making sense of the themes raised, and although there is indeed a need to push him further than he went, to say what he did not and to emphasise what he would not, this has to be guided by consistent logic and not simply pragmatic empiricism.

    <str name="description">This article examines how students from the &amp;quot;loser&amp;quot; sections of the middle class dealt with the game of secondary schooling in a &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; state school in the city of Buenos Aires (Argentina). It engages with Bourdieu's theory of social practice and, in particular, with its concepts of game, habitus and cultural capital. It argues that middle-class students embody a school habitus, which I call &amp;quot;zafar.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Zafar&amp;quot; (a Spanish slang word) refers to students' dispositions, practices and strategies towards social and educational demands of teachers and their school. &amp;quot;Zafar&amp;quot; propels middle-class students to be just &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot; students, and promote an instrumental approach to schooling and learning. Although this paper offers an account within which the reproduction of relative educational advantage of a group of middle-class students takes place, it also poses questions about their future educational and occupational opportunities.

    <str name="description">This paper explores Indian women's views on arranged marriages in the United Kingdom. It is based on research carried out with 32 Indian women studying at a university in the South East of England, UK. The article draws on Wenger's social theory of learning to explore how Indian women's participation in communities of practice in higher education contributes to their participation in arranged marriages. The concept of &amp;quot;social capital&amp;quot; is used to discuss how women are able to negotiate their participation in arranged marriages, It is used to examine the knowledge and identity resources that women develop through their participation in higher education, which provides them with the means from which to develop the necessary &amp;quot;bridging ties&amp;quot; leading to their active participation in the wider South Asian community.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Roberts, Steven</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In the 1980s, researchers established the need to document and analyse the educational attitudes, behaviours and outcomes of "ordinary kids" as a means of developing a holistic account of school experience. Yet, while significant attention is given to extremes in educational attitudes and behaviours, "ordinariness" tends to remain overlooked in contemporary research and policy discourses. This article contributes to this void by presenting data from a qualitative study of young men's school-to-work transitions. Their educational experiences at both compulsory and post-compulsory levels illustrate a distinctive middle-ground, defying typically conceived dualisms of resistance or engagement. Alongside research interest in the extremes of "success" and "failure", such ordinary experiences can enable us to reinvigorate and refine our conceptual repertoire. (Contains 2 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">In the context of the ongoing debate between critical race theory (CRT) and Marxism, I begin in this paper by examining the origins of CRT in Critical Legal Studies (CLS) in the United States. I go on to describe CRT's entry into education, first in that country, and then in the United Kingdom. I move on to a discussion of current debates between critical race theorists and Marxists, focusing on an analysis of arguments for the existence of abstract racial domination.

    <str name="description">After the re-establishment of independent Estonian statehood in 1991, Russian lost its privileges as the dominant and official language in Estonia, and Estonian continued as the only official language. This paper attempts to map the position of a Russian-speaking teacher within the sociological categories of power and language, based on the analysis of legislative acts and strategic documents within the domain of language policy and language legitimization practices in historical retrospective. The main focus of the study stresses an attempt to elaborate on to what extent the low self-efficacy of Russian-speaking teachers as the agents of legitimization of the Estonian language in Russian-speaking schools, and their low position in power relations within the Estonian education system, can be explained in the categories of power and language, as conceptualized on the basis of the social theory of Bourdieu.

    <str name="description">Selective and comprehensive school systems vary in both the degree and timing of selection. To study the consequences of such variation, cross-national comparisons are usually undertaken. Given that cultural differences between countries affect pathways and outcomes, apportioning causal influence in such studies can be difficult. In 1970s Britain, selective and comprehensive systems coexisted. This enables us to compare the influences of organisational arrangements without the complication of national cultural differences. We analyse, for children of various abilities, while taking account of gender and class, the effect on achievement of experiencing comprehensive or selective schooling. Assuming that contextual and individual factors work conjuncturally in producing outcomes, we employ Ragin's configurational Qualitative Comparative Analysis. By treating cases in the National Child Development Study as configurations of factors, we are able to analyse the sufficient and necessary conditions for achievement. We find that system differences affect only some high-ability children's educational outcomes. (Contains 9 notes, 3 figures and 11 tables.)</str>

    <str name="description">In this article we explore the dual role of global university rankings in the creation of a new, knowledge-identified, transnational capitalist class and in facilitating new forms of social exclusion. We examine how and why the practice of ranking universities has become widely defined by national and international organisations as an important instrument of political and economic policy. We consider the development of university rankings into a global business combining social research, marketing and public relations, as a tangible policy tool that narrowly redefines the social purposes of higher education itself. Finally, it looks at how the influence of rankings on national funding for teaching and research constrains wider public debate about the meaning of "good" and meaningful education in the United Kingdom and other national contexts, particularly by shifting the debate away from democratic publics upward into the elite networked institutions of global capital. We conclude by arguing that, rather than regarding world university rankings as a means to establish criteria of educational value, the practice may be understood as an exclusionary one that furthers the alignment of higher education with neoliberal rationalities at both national and global levels.

    <str name="description">The authors review &amp;quot;White middle class identities and urban schooling,&amp;quot; by D. Reay, G. Crozier and D. James. This book focuses on the perspectives of white middle-class parents who make &amp;quot;against&amp;quot;-the-grain school choices for their children in urban England. It provides key insights into the dynamics of class practising that are played out in these choices and the multiple narratives and contexts that influence them. Fundamentally this book queries the real challenges that exist in reinvigorating democracy and egalitarianism in a context of declining levels of public civic engagement. The book is a harsh criticism of the white middle classes and is at times uncomfortable reading in that there is something of a sense of hopelessness about the prospect of behaving ethically, which may challenge the assumption of the egalitarian nature of one's principles. The book will be of interest to education and social policy researchers, sociologists, education professionals and indeed left-leaning white middle class parents.</str>

    <str name="title">Rethinking Culture and Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Stambach, Amy</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The author reviews three books that provide complementary and thought-provoking insights. The three books under review are: (1) &amp;quot;Reproducing class: education, neoliberalism, and the rise of the new middle class in Istanbul,&amp;quot; by Henry J. Rutz and Erol M. Balkan; (2) &amp;quot;Technology, culture, family: influences on home life,&amp;quot; by Elizabeth B. Silva; and (3) &amp;quot;Education and cultural citizenship,&amp;quot; by Nick Stevenson. Across all three works, several themes appear that have long been central to the study of culture and education. The first is that education is a meta-discourse for reproducing social class. The second theme addresses how media, advertising, tests, and curricula structure the field of education, broadly defined. The third and fourth themes are also familiar ideas in studies of education: that which may be called training is distinct from embodied learning (to paraphrase Dewey 1930, 15); and embodied learning, not training and skilling, are crucial for building strong democracies. Since it is not possible to cover all of the common themes, the author highlights the ethnographic, empirical, and historical evidence the three books raise in support of their arguments, and he uses their findings to consider some of the ways these authors' observations and analyses inspire a rethinking of culture and education.</str>

    <str name="title">Where Next for Vocational Education?</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Keep, Ewart</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The author of this review begins with a declaration of interest--more than a decade and a half ago he, along with Alison Wolf and 13 other researchers, signed a letter to the &amp;quot;Financial Times&amp;quot; protesting at design flaws in National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs). Their missive provoked a grumpy response from the then National Council for Vocational Qualifications, but the issues it raised were ignored by policy-makers. The Wolf Review, in part, explores some of the lasting consequences of government's choice of living with and sometimes even loving a deeply deficient system of vocational qualifications (VQs). Wolf's report runs to 196 pages (including technical appendices), raises a host of complex and contentious issues, and makes 27 recommendations. In this article, the author addresses a few key issues, which raise both immediate questions about policy formation but which also reflect deeper structural issues, such as the nature of the labour market and its wage systems, and vocational education's relationship with employment and with distinctive national conceptions of skill and occupation. By far the Review's largest achievement is to confront policy-makers with problems and issues of which they have sometimes been aware, but also in profound denial of, for many years. Thus most of the Review's conclusions will not come as news to researchers, but their appearance in an officially-commissioned policy review renders it difficult for government to avoid addressing them. This is extremely important because one of the key means by which English policy-makers cope with the counterfactual is by simply refusing to acknowledge that it exists and by therefore not producing any response, reasoned or otherwise, to the challenges raised. The Department for Education has accepted all the Review's recommendations in full, Professor Wolf has been given a watching brief to help ensure follow through, and reviews arising from Wolf's recommendations are under way around issues such as league-table criteria, English and mathematics qualifications, and VQ reform. However, it would be unwise to assume the inevitability of swift and smooth progress. Many policy-makers know that their most powerful weapons are often inactivity, inertia and the ability to &amp;quot;sit it out&amp;quot; until the demand for reform dies down. Their problem is that many of the issues raised by Wolf, far from dwindling, are liable to only become more acute and visible if decisive action is not taken.</str>

    <str name="description">International research into educational decision-making has been extensive, focusing on the way in which young people and their families assess the different options open to them. However, to what extent can we assume that different groups of young people have equal access to the information needed to make such an assessment? And what role, if any, do schools play in this process? Using in-depth qualitative interviews from two schools with very different student intakes, this paper examines the key influences that shape young people's choices. Decisions about whether to go on to higher education are found to reflect three sets of processes: individual habitus; the institutional habitus of the school, as reflected in the amount and type of guidance provided; and young people's own agency--namely, the conscious process whereby students seek out information on different options and evaluate these alternatives.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Mizrachi, Nissim</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article draws attention to the growing evidence of a mismatch between sociological categorization and actors' worlds of meaning as expressed in the classroom. The mismatch is especially blatant in cases where students from disadvantaged groups are introduced to what educators and theorists presume to be the liberating discourse of multicultural education. Nurtured by recent developments in the sociology of culture, the article sheds light on this phenomenon by delving into the logic of the actors' own worlds of meaning while making a concerted effort to avoid directing prepackaged allegations of &amp;quot;false consciousness&amp;quot; at informants. The article delves into the mismatch by reviewing multicultural education sites in two national contexts, the United States and Israel. Its findings from a unique high school in Jerusalem invite researchers to explore new avenues for understanding cultural encounters at school in view of the growing multicultural reality.

    <str name="description">The way in which private schools use rhetoric in their communications offers important insights into how these organizational sites persuade audiences and leverage marketplace advantage in the context of contemporary educational platforms. Through systemic analysis of rhetorical strategies employed in 65 &amp;quot;elite&amp;quot; school prospectuses in Australia, this paper contributes to understandings of the ways schools' communications draw on broader cultural politics in order to shape meanings and interactions among organizational actors. We identify six strategies consistently used by schools to this end: identification, juxtapositioning, bolstering or self-promotion, partial reporting, self-expansion, and reframing or reversal. We argue that, in the context of marketization and privatization discourses in twenty-first-century western education, these strategies attempt to subvert potentially threatening discourses, in the process actively reproducing broader economic and social privilege and inequalities.

    <str name="description">Higher education is commonly described as offering combinations of work and leisure, but the implied relationship is often limited. Different conceptions of leisure, especially leisure as pleasurable experience, raise new possibilities for seeing academic activity itself as leisure in several important senses. The importance of identifying pleasure as a necessary component of work and politics is discussed. Several more specific approaches to try to understand such pleasures are reviewed: Cultural Studies approaches, the work of Bourdieu on taste, and some recent work in the Sociology of Leisure.</str>

Their study, based on fieldwork undertaken in Toronto and Vancouver, is guided by the &amp;quot;primary argument&amp;quot; that &amp;quot;youth subcultures are certainly not dead and neither is class&amp;quot;. As Dillabough and Kennelly appreciate, the lives of young people today are at once more than local and less than global. Split into two sections and seven chapters, the first three chapters of &amp;quot;Lost Youth in the Global City&amp;quot; provide a comprehensive introduction to literature and theoretical approaches to youth, the types of theoretical concepts and ideas utilised, and the research methods and techniques deployed in the book. &amp;quot;Lost Youth in the Global City&amp;quot; is a theoretically accomplished book. The multiple research methods will encourage students in qualitative research to broaden the breadth of their activities and modes of data collection. Dillabough and Kennelly make a compelling argument that shows how the experiences of young people are sharply delineated across the fault-lines of race and class. (Contains 2 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">This article presents a review of &amp;quot;Making socialists: Mary Bridges Adams and the fight for knowledge and power, 1855-1939,&amp;quot; by Jane Martin. Jane Martin has explored the history of late-nineteenth-century and early-twentieth century-British women educational activists in numerous publications over the past two decades. Her first book, &amp;quot;Women and the Politics of Schooling in Victorian and Edwardian England&amp;quot; (Martin 1999b), set out the themes she would continue to explore in her subsequent work. Martin is drawn to biography or the telling of individual lives as a way to illuminate broader social movements and political forces and to show how individuals have exercised their own agency to shape history. At its best, this careful excavation of the details of individual lives can produce the historical equivalent of Clifford Geertz's &amp;quot;thick description,&amp;quot; an amassing of specific incidents that can challenge accepted orthodoxies and provide the material for new perspectives on the past. Martin refers to her work as &amp;quot;historical detective work&amp;quot;. By this she means a concern with the ignored or overlooked details of the lives of individuals, a project of uncovering the kind of subjugated knowledge that Foucault described as central to the project of historical genealogy.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    <str name="description">The disturbances that took place across English towns and cities in 2011 raised significant debate and discussion about their causes and the motivations of the &amp;quot;rioters&amp;quot;. Media and official explanations citing criminality and opportunism, repeated the now familiar narratives of cultural deficit, blaming absent fathers, poor parenting and a lack of responsibility and aspiration. Prime Minister David Cameron announced the &amp;quot;moral collapse&amp;quot; of a society in which &amp;quot;children without fathers, schools without discipline and reward without effort&amp;quot; were to blame for the disturbances. Socio-political explanations, on the other hand, emphasised structural inequalities and/or rampant consumerism brought about by a &amp;quot;feral&amp;quot; capitalism. This article presents a review of three books that were written before the &amp;quot;riots&amp;quot; but each takes up themes that are pertinent to the discussion of their aftermath. All three books, in different ways and from different perspectives, offer statements on patterns and systems of opportunity and constraint/inequality and the individual and collective capacity of people to deal with these. Each book presents its own version of &amp;quot;success against the odds&amp;quot; and will significantly add to the sociological literature on ethnicity and education. Researched and written towards the end of New Labour's third term in office, the books also offer a timely opportunity to reflect on recent government policies emphasising &amp;quot;aspiration&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;equality of opportunity&amp;quot; and social mobility.</str>

    <str name="description">This article, based on qualitative research in Greater Manchester, examines the experience of migrants in navigating the education system, and in particular in choosing secondary schools for their children. There has been extensive research on the process of choosing schools since the policy reforms of the 1980s, but none has examined how the process of choosing a secondary school is impacted by the material and affective impact of migration. The article argues that migrants' experience is embedded in gendered, classed and racialised processes and that, despite the heterogeneity of the category, migrants often face particular barriers in negotiating the school system. Nonetheless it also explores the importance put on education by the migrants who were interviewed and the active labour they engage in to try and achieve the best results for their children.

    <str name="title">One Foot out the School Door? Interpreting the Risk for Dropout upon the Transition to Post-Secondary Vocational Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Elffers, Louise</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Many students drop out in the first year after a school transition. Most commonly used indicators of an increased risk for dropout reveal little of the mechanisms that push or pull students out of school. In this study, we look at the association of a set of common risk indicators with students' supportive resources and school experiences upon the transition to post-secondary vocational education in the Netherlands. Multilevel regression analyses on a diverse sample of 1438 students indicate that most sociodemographic risk indicators relate to less access to supportive resources for school, whereas personal circumstances outside school that are associated with an increased risk for dropout correlate with negative school experiences. Students from lower educated or poor families and students who use drugs, have debts, or are delinquent score negative in both domains, suggesting that those students make the transition with one foot out the school door.

    <str name="description">This article considers the construct of &amp;quot;teacher resilience&amp;quot; from critical discourse and labour process perspectives in order to cast new light on what has been traditionally viewed from a psychological perspective. In this respect, the construct of resilience is placed in the broad political landscape of teachers' work and the labour process of teaching, within a neoliberal globalised economic paradigm. Importantly, this article argues that any conceptualisations of teacher resilience should be critically appraised and not simply &amp;quot;taken for granted&amp;quot;. While the concept of developing &amp;quot;teacher resilience&amp;quot; as a means, for example, of addressing alarmingly high rates of early career teacher attrition may sound like a good idea, it is important to consider the way such constructs can be used to shape and potentially control teacher identity and the nature of teachers' work.

    <str name="description">Drawing upon fieldwork conducted with a group of dislocated Tibetan undergraduate students of the &amp;quot;neidi ban&amp;quot; program in a Han-predominated university, this paper examines the ways in which these students make sense of their worlds. To achieve this, they have actively and engagingly organized a series of symbolically meaningful activities that draw on the symbolic resources from their cultural traditions, their specific educational trajectory, and their anticipation for the future. The paper, nonetheless, also questions in the conclusion how the program can sustain a promising future that is inseparable from the sense of self-worth among the Tibetan students.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Barrett, Brian D.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper draws on the theory of Basil Bernstein and on more recent applications of it by Rob Moore, John Beck and Michael Young to respond to recent calls for the replacement of discipline-based university faculties and departments with &amp;quot;problem-based&amp;quot; curricula and programmes of study. It considers, particularly, the potential consequences of such a shift in higher education policy for the identities of university teachers, researchers and students, and suggests that these calls for reform are premised especially on the problematic assumption that, in Bernsteinian terms, &amp;quot;regionalised&amp;quot; curricular inputs can be expected to produce &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; knowledge outcomes within the university.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Simpson, Donald</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The integration of care and education across pre-school sectors of several European countries is currently a key policy priority. In England this necessitates reform aimed at re-modelling a traditionally hierarchical and divided workforce. Drawing on research with early years professionals, this article explores the micro-politics of reform with a focus on the extent to which workers in pre-school settings are engaging in new collaborative ways of working. In particular, the transformative potential of the communities of practice model in shaping changes to the early years workforce is discussed. Findings reveal the intersection of social class as labour-market position with several cross-cutting issues and their importance in perpetuating continuing inequalities of process. These present a challenge to the emergence of any new form of collaborative inter-professional working arrangements within the English early years context.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper discusses Critical Theory, a model of theorizing in the field of the political sociology of education. We argue for a &amp;quot;reimagined&amp;quot; Critical Theory to herald an empowering, liberatory education that fosters curiosity and critical thinking, and a means for successful bottom-up, top-down political engagement. We present arguments at a theoretical and meta-theoretical level, leaving empirical analysis to a future writing. We hold it impossible: to fully dissociate normative from the analytical in constructing scientific thought, thus showing the importance of the notion of a &amp;quot;good society&amp;quot; to guide varied intellectual explorations; to deny the political role of education; and to detach from historicity of thought and policy prescriptions emerging from such theorizing, as not all social constructions are equal in terms of logical configuration, methodological rigor, or solid empirical proof. What follows are snapshots of how we can &amp;quot;reimagine&amp;quot; the historical present, and how Critical Theory can impact the new theorizing of sociology of education.

    <str name="description">The retreat from social class within the sociology of education has been accompanied by the intensification of socio-economic and cultural inequalities. This paper seeks to draw upon cultural analyses of social class by addressing a classificatory shift of white English working-class males, who have moved from an ascribed primary "socio-economic" status to an embodied "aesthetic" performance. We examine the reconfiguration of social class within state schools and historical and contemporary shifting images of white working-class males within the education literature. We suggest the need to engage with a multi-dimensional explanatory frame in order to understand how working-class young men now inhabit a new cultural condition in the post-colonial urban space of inner-city schools. This shift is best captured by exploring the simultaneous articulations of multiple categories of difference--including class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality and generation--in relation to contemporary representations of social class.

    <str name="title">Breaking Away to Find a Way: Poverty and School Failure in a Spanish Adolescent Life-History</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Calderon-Almendros, I.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article is part of a biographical research study, and explores the social path that an adolescent from a marginal background in Malaga (Spain) has travelled throughout his life. The research shows a class differentiation that divides society in two: you, who control the means of production, impose your culture, and define the policy and the school; and we, who live in poor houses and districts, learn in the street and do things that are worthy of punishment--the bad ones. School failure, the result and cause of this division, leads to social failure, provoking &amp;quot;guerrillas against the good ones&amp;quot; (teachers, peers, guards, police, judges, etc.) of youngsters who have learned to devalue themselves as people and as a group: youngsters who have to break away to find a way.</str>

    <str name="description">The South Asian diaspora and its impact on the lives of dispersed communities is a complex phenomenon finding expression in a range of issues and debates. However, the nature and scale of the challenges and issues vary in each case and context, and even over generations. These issues become more sensitive and poignant when underpinned by cultural and belief systems. This paper debates the impact of dominant discourses and values on schooling choices and the related concerns to explore issues linked to girls' education among Pakistani diaspora in England, drawing on relevant literature and the evidence from a recent study of single-sex schooling. It argues that multiple emotional, social, cultural, historical, political, economic and other affiliations influence the patterns of behaviour and the terms of civic engagement in the adopted country leading to a struggle over meanings and competing positions over values and practices that are fluid and dynamic.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Collin, Ross</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article examines how career portfolio programs at two secondary schools establish corporeal regimes. Both programs require students to compose portfolios that plot their trajectories through school and into paid work. Prior to graduation, students defend their portfolios before panels of educators and businesspeople. Employing the Bourdieusian concepts of capital and habitus, this article investigates how these programs set up systems that value certain kinds of bodies. Further, it examines how students negotiate these systems and display different kinds of bodies in different kinds of ways. Ultimately, it is argued these disparate bodily performances are read by authorities as indicators of the types of paths students are travelling or should travel into the future.

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper presents some results of a qualitative study carried out in a secondary school in the city of Buenos Aires (Argentina). It examines how two students from poor families responded to, and viewed, aggression by peers at their school. This paper argues that the examination of students' narratives about aggression (based on classism and sexism) illustrates the analytical usefulness of the moral dimension of social life to unpack crucial aspects of the micro politics of class and gender and processes of identity-making. Following Sayer, this article maps students' responses to immoral sentiments and misrecognition: the search for respect and respectability, and moral boundary drawing. It demonstrates that these reactions are entangled in students' class and gender identity-making. It also shows how &amp;quot;victims&amp;quot; are able to regain respect. However, the individualized nature of these processes and the spirals of aggression they instigate demonstrate the fragile and temporary nature of this achievement. (Contains 15 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">The three books reviewed in this essay all have a similar theme: the role that schools and other institutions can play in improving the life-chances of young people and breaking the cycle of socio-economic disadvantage and low educational attainment that is characteristic of school systems around the world. Through an evaluation of the Academies Programme, through an examination of interventions to widen participation in higher education, and through trying to understand how the "disadvantaged" and "disaffected" "do" school, each book seeks to address fundamental issues of social justice with regard to the quality of the educational experience of society's most vulnerable groups. The three books reviewed here are explicit in their desire to contribute to the body of work that aims to improve educational equity for disadvantaged students. However, the author's main reservation with the research either reported on or undertaken by the authors featured here relates to method: and particularly the research design, sampling strategy, method of analysis, and warrant. Without a strong empirical foundation it is difficult to see how this research can contribute to the understanding of what might work to improve the educational experiences of those in disadvantaged schools and communities.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper draws on a research study into the existence and use of different forms of capital--including social, cultural and physical capital--in three independent schools in Scotland. We were interested in understanding how these forms of capital work to produce and reproduce &amp;quot;advantage&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;privilege&amp;quot;. Analysis is framed by a multiple capitals approach drawing on and developing the work of Putnam and especially Bourdieu. We suggest that sport plays a role with important effects for strong bonding and for the production of symbolic capital in the form of branding by each school. (Contains 12 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">This article advocates for socially just pedagogies in higher education to challenge senses of normalcy that perpetuate elitist academic attitudes towards the inclusion of disabled students. Normalcy is equated here with an everyday eugenics, which heralds a non-disabled person without &amp;quot;defects&amp;quot;, or impairments, as the ideal norm. This article attempts to mark the pervasiveness of normalcy in higher education by presenting findings from a systematic experience survey of disabled students and non-disabled students within one higher education institution in the United Kingdom. The findings indicate that disabled students who have institutional disability support express more difficulties in their learning and assessment than students with no known disability. However, it was found that there was no significant difference in academic achievement between the two cohorts of students. In relation to the latter point, the evidence also shows that disabled students who do not receive institutional disability support underperform. (Contains 4 tables and 2 figures.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Ryan, Mary</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Pre-service teacher education is a spatialised enterprise. It operates across a number of spaces that may or may not be linked ideologically and/or physically. These spaces can include daily practices, locations, infrastructure, relationships and representations of power and ideology. The interrelationships between and within these (sometimes competing) spaces for pre-service teachers will influence their identities as teachers and learners across time and space. Pre-service teachers are expected to make the connections between these often-contradictory spaces with little or no guidance on how to negotiate such complex relationships. These are difficult spaces, yet the slippages and gaps between these spaces offer generative possibilities. This paper explores these spaces of possibility for pre-service teacher education, and uses the spatial theories of Lefebvre and Foucault to argue that critical reflective practice can be used to create Soja's &amp;quot;thirdspace&amp;quot; for reconstructing future practice.</str>

    <str name="title">Do Women Publish Fewer Journal Articles than Men? Sex Differences in Publication Productivity in the Social Sciences</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Bird, Karen Schucan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines whether women and men publish journal articles at a level comparable with their representation within the social sciences. The paper also explores sex differences in patterns of single authorship and co-authorship. To do so, demographic data of the UK social sciences is compared with a sample of UK-authored journal articles. The findings of the study show that, overall, female academics contribute to a lower proportion of journal articles than the proportion of academic staff that they constitute. However, within certain disciplines (social policy and psychology) women publish articles at a level comparable with the proportion of the discipline that they constitute. These findings, it is argued, can be helpfully understood as both cause and consequence of the gendered academy. (Contains 8 tables and 1 figure.)</str>

    <str name="title">Social Class, Families and the Politics of Educational Advantage: The Work of Dennis Marsden</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Ball, Stephen J.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article presents a review of Dennis Marsden's work. Looking at his oeuvre overall it is the family and intimate social relations and social class that are at the centre of his interests and analytical focus. Part of the power and effectiveness of his work was an ability to see families and their everyday lives in relation to social policy and to relate policies and their effects back to the intimate everyday lives of families. "Education and the Working Class" is about class mobility, class inequality and waste, and about what Marsden describes as a "blockage"--selective education. In stark contrast to the sometimes pathologising focus on working-class failure in much of the contemporary sociology of education, "Education and the Working Class" works with a sample of 90 "successfully" working-class children. That is, children who passed the 11+ and went to grammar school and many of whom went on to higher education. "Mothers Alone: Poverty and the Fatherless Family" is about single mothers and fatherless families living on "national assistance". The book presents the "elements of grief and loss in these mothers' descriptions of their lives". They are women who are often lonely and social isolated but also struggling to maintain a decent standard of life for their children. "The State of Affairs: Explorations in Infidelity and Commitment" is an edited collection, part of a series on personal relationships, and contains two papers--""From Here to epiphany": Power and Identity in the Narrative of an Affair", and "Affairs and Children". In many respects this is very different from Marsden's earlier research but it nonetheless addresses and extends some key themes, particularly and obviously the focus on the family and family life, and emotions and intimate social relationships. In many ways Marsden's work anticipated many of the research sensibilities that were re-discovered through the move to "reflexivity" in the 1980s and 1990s. He also anticipated aspects of the feminist critiques of social policy that were developed in the same period. His focus on "class discomforts" and exclusion and alienation at school and university anticipated a whole tranche of work done in the past 15 years that deploys Bourdieu to explore the work of different capitals and habituses in the education field, both at school and in higher education. The focus on the social and family lives of women also anticipates the subsequent burgeoning of studies of classed mothering. Throughout the books also, there is a sense of the intimacy, emotionality, diversity and complexity of family life. (Contains 5 notes.)</str>

    <str name="title">Ideal Knowing: Logics of Knowledge in Primary School Curricula</str>

      <str>Macknight, Vicki</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper is written to draw attention to the ideal knower and the logic of knowledge embedded in curricula. New logics and new knowers, I argue, are conjured with the hope they will be capable of succeeding in curriculum designers' imagined future. I frame this discussion in terms of debates about the place of knowledge in the sociology of education. Knowledge and knowers are produced together in curriculum, and it is useful to keep them together in studying classrooms. The bulk of the paper is a detailed comparison of two curricula written for the Australian state of Victoria. I will show that one--the 2000 Curriculum Standards Framework, second edition--follows a logic of truth. The second--the 2007 Victorian Essential Learning Standards--follows a logic of realisation. These contrasting logics require and instantiate quite different types of knower.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Walker, Melanie</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines the life history narratives of a group of 12 black and white male and female undergraduate students at a historically white Afrikaans medium university, now undergoing its own transformation in post-apartheid South Africa. Conceptualizations of identity and discourse across four elements of context, setting, situated activity and self are employed to examine their accounts. Three framing discourses, comprising the official storyline of a rainbow nation and new higher education policies, the formal storyline of institutional change, and the informal space of relationships and interactions are used to analyse student narratives in terms of how they produce, reproduce and transform race and identity. What emerges is a complicated picture in which identities cannot be simply read off either from the official discourse or from colour and culture as the levels of discourse articulate and collide with a history of racial separateness and context and setting, with particular identity effects. What varieties of men and women now prevail in this society and in this period? And what varieties are coming to prevail? In what ways are they selected and formed, liberated and repressed, made sensitive and blunted? ( Mills, 1959 , p. 7)</str>

    <str name="title">The &amp;quot;Self-Interested&amp;quot; Woman Academic: A Consideration of Beck's Model of the &amp;quot;Individualised Individual&amp;quot;</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Skelton, Christine</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The work of Ulrich Beck, particularly his concept of the &amp;quot;individualised individual&amp;quot;, is increasingly cited by educational social scientists. As yet, there have been few empirical investigations that consider how applicable and relevant is the notion of the &amp;quot;individualised individual&amp;quot; in understanding how people make sense of their lives (for an exception, see Reay, 2003). This paper considers Beck's assertion that social class is of increasingly less importance as society shifts from a first to a second modernity. Interviews were carried out into the career experiences of a group of academic women working in higher education institutions. The conclusions reached suggest that if Beck's theory is to be useful in understanding contemporary actors in contemporary societies then the critical concepts he introduces need to be articulated by researchers in more complex ways.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper is based on 1001 home-based interviews with UK adults. It describes their varying patterns of participation in lifelong learning and their use of technology for learning and leisure. It finds that 37% of all adults report no further education of any kind after reaching compulsory school leaving age. This proportion declines with each age cohort, but is largely replaced by a pattern of lengthening initial education and still reporting no later education. These patterns of participation are predictable to a large extent from regression analysis using a life-order model of determining variables--all of which are set very early in life. This suggests that universal theories to describe participation, such as human capital theory, are incorrect in several respects. Where individuals create, for themselves and through their early experiences, a 'learner identity' inimicable to further study, then the prospect of learning can become a burden rather than an investment for them. This has implications for the now widespread and extensively funded notion of overcoming barriers to access via technology.</str>

    <str name="title">The Construction of &amp;quot;Age Difference&amp;quot; and the Impact of Age-Mixing within UK Further Education Colleges</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Brooks, Rachel</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">&amp;quot;Age&amp;quot; is an important social category used to define individuals and groups within our society and, often, to structure access to power, prestige and status. However, within educational research, age has been relatively neglected when compared with other social categories such as gender, class and ethnicity. In an attempt to begin to explore the impact of age within schools and colleges, this paper focuses on students' and teachers' experience of mixed-age learning groups within the UK further education sector. First, the paper outlines various assumptions about the distinctiveness of age groups that underpin much sociological theorizing as well as current educational policy within the United Kingdom. It then draws on an empirical study of six further education colleges in Yorkshire and the south-east of England to suggest that the ways in which students and members of staff construct notions of &amp;quot;age&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;age difference&amp;quot; bear little resemblance to the models adopted by policymakers. Nevertheless, the paper goes on to argue that, although there was little consensus about where the boundary between &amp;quot;younger&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;older&amp;quot; learners should be drawn, most respondents were able to identify specific age-related differences that they believed affected the process of learning. In particular, mixed-age classes were believed to offer considerable advantages over more age-homogeneous groups. The final part of the paper explores some of these putative advantages and discusses their significance in the light of current debates about the &amp;quot;postponement&amp;quot; of adulthood and the nature of inter-generational relationships.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper describes a qualitative study about pedagogic practices in the family. The pedagogic code underlying family practices is characterized and related to specific social groups. Students' achievement is discussed in relation to family and school pedagogic practices. The analysis of family pedagogic practice was based on a model derived from Bernstein's theory. The model considers two main dimensions, the coding orientation and its specific realizations in both the instructional and regulative contexts. It provided indicators of the family discursive context and the form in which knowledges and values are transmitted. The model developed allowed a deep and delicate analysis of the family socializing context. The study showed that families differ in their coding orientation and pedagogic practices, and suggested that there are factors other than social groups to determine family's pedagogic practice. It also suggested that specific familial practices may explain children's differential achievement at school.</str>

    <str name="description">The aim of this study was to identify and re-present the experiences and views of a sample of children who have been 'missing' from education, and those of their parents/carers. Access to this hard to reach population has been possible as a result of an innovative interventionist tracking system, responding to pupil mobility, developed by the Education Authority in the fieldwork area. Semistructured interviews were conducted with parents/carers, children and young people with the aim of obtaining a demographic profile of families and eliciting a chronology of factors that participants saw as contributing to a child going missing from school systems. Three distinct life-course groups emerged from participants' accounts illustrating different degrees of disengagement from external systems. The authors conclude with a discussion of the different challenges each life-course group presents, for education policy and practice.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper draws on questionnaire responses received (via e-mail) during the period 2002-2003 from senior commissioning editors located within seven of the major UK publishing outlets. Drawing on the analytical framework of an earlier study by Nixon (1999), it focuses on the mediation of educational studies by market forces operating within and upon the educational publishing industry. More specifically it explores issues relating to the construction of readership, authorship and editorship within that force field of market pressures. Central to the argument is the claim that, in its increasing exposure to market forces, the public space afforded by educational publishing is now highly restrictive. The paper concludes with a call for a sustained debate on the future of academic publishing in general, and educational publishing in particular.</str>

    <str name="description">Among the more relevant questions in educational research is how the governments and policy-makers in transition countries address the high educational inequality inherited from the past and what policies they develop in order to reduce the strong effects of the background family and the type of school on students' achievements, their aspirations and their chances of succeeding in the most important educational transitions. This paper addresses one of the most topical issues in this area, namely the social selectivity of Czech basic and secondary education. Special attention is paid to the role of 'multi-year' gymnasia. The results of analyses carried out on data from the Programme for International Student Assessment 2000 study corroborate the initial hypothesis according to which multi-year gymnasia, introduced into the Czech educational system after 1989, represent one of the main sources of the variation in students' achievements at the end of compulsory education. However, this variation can be almost entirely accounted for by the specific socio-economic background of the students. The same holds true for their future aspirations. The results of the analysis support the conclusions of the OECD Review of National Policies for Education from 1996.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Distributed leadership has come to prominence in school management discourse as a means to achieve the participation and empowerment of teachers and to create democratic schools. In this paper I explore the contradictions between these claims and both the hierarchical power structure of schools and the use of distributed leadership to secure the commitment of teachers to government education agendas. I examine how the relationship between distributed leadership and managerial power is addressed in the discourse of education management theorists and the practice of head-teachers. Examples of authentically democratic schools based on collective self-management provide the basis for questioning the hegemonic hierarchical model.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines the ways in which British Chinese pupils are positioned and represented within the popular/dominant discourse of teachers working in London schools. Drawing on individual interviews from a study conducted with 30 teachers, 80 British Chinese pupils and 30 Chinese parents, we explore some of the racialised, gendered and classed assumptions upon which dominant discourses around British Chinese boys and girls are based. Consideration is given, for example, to teachers' dichotomous constructions of British Chinese masculinity, in which British Chinese boys were regarded as &amp;quot;naturally&amp;quot; &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;not laddish&amp;quot;, compared with a minority of 'bad' British Chinese boys, whose laddishness was attributed to membership of a multiethnic peer group. We also explore teachers' constructions of British Chinese femininity, which centred around remarkably homogenised representations of British Chinese girls as &amp;quot;passive&amp;quot; and quiet, &amp;quot;repressed&amp;quot;, hard-working pupils. The paper discusses a range of alternative readings that challenge popular monolithic and homogenising accounts of British Chinese masculinity and femininity in order to open up more critical ways of representing and engaging with British Chinese educational &amp;quot;achievement&amp;quot;.</str>

    <str name="title">Comparing State Hegemonies: Chinese Universities in Postwar Singapore and Hong Kong</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Wong, Ting-Hong</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">After World War II, Chinese residents of Singapore demanded the establishment of local Chinese universities. The ruling regime, however, which was under the shadow of the neighboring Malay-dominated Malay Peninsula, was forced to suppress the development of such schools. In Hong Kong, the British needed to install a Chinese university to counter Beijing's and Taiwan's campaigns for recruiting students from the colony. As Hong Kong was a monoracial Chinese society, the government, not having to worry about the reaction of other indigenous groups, met this challenge by founding a fully recognized Chinese university. This research demonstrates that under diverse backgrounds of racial politics, state authorities have unequal latitudes to accommodate the educational institutions of subordinated racial groups. It also reveals that state education policies in small and dependent settings, unlike those in big and sovereign nations, are more susceptible to pressures from external powers and influences from the metropolis. These findings urge scholars to pay more attention to the factor of race and use comparative methods when employing the theories of state and hegemony to investigate education and power.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Stevenson, Howard</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper draws on research in three English Midlands local education authorities to analyse the changing role of the teacher trade union representative in schools. It focuses on representatives of the largest teachers' union in England and Wales--the National Union of Teachers. The paper draws on mainstream industrial relations literature, and more recent research into school sector industrial relations, to assess how the role of the union representative is changing in an era of autonomous schools. The research indicates that new issues are emerging in schools, and these have the potential to transform the role of the representative. Where representatives can respond to the emergence of these new issues there is the prospect of a new, more participative trade union culture developing in schools. However, it is far from certain that school union representatives will want to assume these increased responsibilities, and this poses a major challenge for the development of teacher trade unionism.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper draws upon a range of ideas and concepts developed by the British sociologist Basil Bernstein to examine recent challenges and changes encountered by members of professional occupations, including those who teach and research in higher education. The paper discusses and seeks to develop Bernstein's analysis of how particular structurings of knowledge may be related to the formation of occupational identities centred in what Bernstein refers to as &amp;quot;inwardness&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;inner dedication&amp;quot;. It then examines a range of challenges to such identities--particularly those arising from the &amp;quot;regionalisation&amp;quot; of knowledge and from &amp;quot;genericim&amp;quot;. The paper concludes by assessing the prospects for perpetuating such identities in an era of increasing marketization and managerialism.</str>

    <str name="description">The 1990s, a decade of democratic advances and consumption euphoria in South Korea, heralded a new wind called 'neoliberal education'. It is within this historical juncture that I conducted an ethnographic research on low-income youths who had dropped out of mainstream high schools. While I investigated these youths' educational and career aspirations, I examined how discourses in neoliberal freedom and free marketization shape (and are shaping) these youths' self-fashioning. Central to my analysis is how this process of identity construction is intersected with class marginality. A predominate number of youths in my research express their preference in service sector and/or entertainment industries. The paper addresses how neoliberal discourses and consumerism rhetoric are negotiated and transformed in youth's narratives on aspirations. The analysis speaks to the ideological pitfall of neoliberalism, echoing critical scholars' thesis that neoliberalistic education with free market principles perpetuated and broadened existing inequalities.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Mendick, Heather</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In this paper I address the question: How is it that people come to choose mathematics and in what ways is this process gendered? I draw on the findings of a qualitative research study involving interviews with 43 young people all studying mathematics in post-compulsory education in England. Working within a post-structuralist framework, I argue that gender is a project and one that is achieved in interaction with others. Through a detailed reading of Toni and Claudia's stories I explore the tensions for young women who are engaging in mathematics, something that is discursively inscribed as masculine, while (understandably) being invested in producing themselves as female. I conclude by arguing that seeing 'doing mathematics' as 'doing masculinity' is a productive way of understanding why mathematics is so male dominated and by looking at the implications of this understanding for gender and mathematics reform work.</str>

    <str name="description">In spite of a progressive institutionalisation of community-based learning into higher education, relatively little is known about the actual dynamics and correlates of volunteering by students. The study presented seeks a more in-depth understanding of the spontaneous, extracurricular involvement within a university student population. Data are drawn from a postal survey of a representative sample of third-year university students enrolled at a Flemish university (n = 744). In a first step, an exploration of the course and nature of students volunteer involvement is provided. In a second step, an explanatory model is constructed to predict the likelihood of belonging to the categories of volunteers, former volunteers or non-volunteers. Firstly, it appears that a large group of students drop out of volunteering in transition to university, and that volunteering is rarely given priority in students agenda. Furthermore, a bifurcated pattern of involvement with a different pace inside and outside university is identified. Finally, extensive embedding in a volunteer environment as well as the discipline of study are major predictors of volunteering by students. Gender, church practice, being encouraged to volunteer and subjective study pressure produce subsidiary effects.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines the changing nature of professional practice in English further education. At a time when neo-liberal reform has significantly impacted on this under-researched and over-market-tested sector, little is known about who its practitioners are and how they construct meaning in their work. Sociological interest in the field has tended to focus on further education practitioners as either the subjects of market and managerial reform or as creative agents operating within the contradictions of audit and inspection cultures. In challenging such dualism, which is reflective of wider sociological thinking, the paper examines the ways in which agency and structure combine to produce a more transformative conception of the further education professional. The approach contrasts with a prevailing policy discourse that seeks to re-professionalise and modernise further education practice without interrogating either the terms of its professionalism or the neo-liberal practices in which it resides.</str>

    <str name="description">Education in Britain increasingly appears to serve a very narrow notion of pedagogy, partly reflecting the &amp;quot;conditions of domination&amp;quot; generated by the rise of the new managerialism in the delivery of public services. In the name of economy, efficiency and effectiveness, social progress is increasingly seen to lie in achieving continual increases in &amp;quot;productivity&amp;quot;, realised through giving management the absolute freedom to arrange its resources in whatever way it feels appropriate. At the heart of this critical reflection on these contemporary developments lies a concern for the role of education in democratic development, as well as the various harms that are the direct result of a profoundly reductionist and dehumanising &amp;quot;education&amp;quot; system. The article concludes by outlining some alternative possibilities for more humane and democratic pedagogical processes.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">The notion of &amp;quot;the school&amp;quot; as a set of institutional processes and practices that shape the possibilities of educational research forms the focus of this article. It is argued that the discursive and material practices that render schools agencies of cultural reproduction also have effects for what research can be undertaken in them and how. With reference to a series of &amp;quot;episodes&amp;quot; that occurred during research about young people and sexuality in New Zealand, evidence for how schools shape research endeavours is provided. These examples present a complex picture of the way in which schools simultaneously police and are regulated by symbolic boundaries of gender and sexuality. How school disciplinary power works to effect what it is possible to claim about the voluntary nature of student research participation is also explored. It is argued that through the powerful discursive and material practices that occur in schools, these institutions can impede research that attempts to transgress dominant meanings about gender and sexuality.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Despite rapid growth in UK postgraduate education and a current focus on issues of access to higher education, consideration of possible social class differentials at the postgraduate level is missing from the sociological literature. Using Higher Education Statistics Agency data, this paper presents a preliminary investigation of the relationship between social class and progression to postgraduate study in England and considers the interplay with other salient variables, including subject of study, institutional type and first-degree achievement. Evidence of a social class differential in progression to higher degrees is used to test various sociological theories, particularly those proposed by Bourdieu. There is support for the concept of &amp;quot;institutional habitus&amp;quot; developed in recent UK studies. It is concluded that there is scope for further in-depth empirical research into social class and postgraduate study.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Homeschooling is enjoying new-found acceptance in North America. Drawing on a variety of secondary sources and our own data from Ontario, Canada, we find that homeschooling is growing steadily, and is becoming an increasingly legitimated form of education. To understand these changes, we review prevailing sociological explanations that focus on the rise of neo-liberal ideology, and pressures of class reproduction and human capital requirements. We document the contributions of these theories and note their limits for understanding the rising popularity of homeschooling. We then situate homeschooling within a broader context of private education, distinguishing segments that encourage market-consumer, class reproduction, human capital and &amp;quot;expressive&amp;quot; logics. The combination of large investments of time and effort with highly uncertain outcomes makes homeschooling the most expressive form of private education, which we trace to the burgeoning culture of &amp;quot;intensive parenting.&amp;quot;</str>

    <str name="description">The study drew on Bernstein's theory and Moscovici's theory of Social Representations to investigate how children in classrooms with different types of structuration developed social representation of the curriculum. Comparable case studies were carried out in schools chosen to reflect three types of pedagogy according to Bernstein's typology. Twelve classrooms took part and ethnographic investigations were employed to compile a typology of recognition and realisation rules to map the range and type of curriculum structuration in each. Children's representations of the curriculum were investigated through specially designed tasks. Findings showed that as children gained experience of schooling they constructed more elaborate social representations of the curriculum regardless of the pedagogic mode and that classroom structuration became a feature of the junior rather than the infant children's representations. Older children in classrooms with performance pedagogies had two classifications for recognising classroom culture, while those in classrooms with mixed and competence pedagogies did not.

    <str name="description">In a previous "British Journal of Sociology of Education" article (Nixon and Wellington, 2005) we examined current trends in book publishing and how these have influenced and will influence the construction of the field of educational studies. (The latter study was a followup to an earlier study reported in Nixon [1999].) The present article focuses on journals and their editors and, to a lesser extent, the role that the peer review process plays in shaping the field of educational studies. We use (critically rather than deferentially) notions drawn from the work of Bourdieu (1996)--the "field of power", defining boundaries, systems of dispositions, right of entry and the "illusio"--to consider and conceptualise data from interviews with 12 journal editors. Our own position in writing this article is as academic practitioners involved in reading, peer-reviewing and editing academic journals within the field of educational studies.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper considers the way social partnerships tend to be represented as either horizontal localised networks or neo-liberal policy instruments. Building on two empirical studies of partnerships, we argue that partnerships cannot be understood in either/or ways but are negotiated at the interface between central agencies and local networks. They are mediated by networks operating through the partnership and through government and community, and by the different organisational logics of agencies. These complexities challenge our ways of analysing and representing partnerships, and justify further research.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Crozier, Gill</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper focuses on the educational experiences of a group of African Caribbean and mixed &amp;quot;race&amp;quot; young people from the perspectives of their parents. The discussion is set within a national context where children of African Caribbean origin are one of the lowest achieving minority ethnic groups in the UK and are disproportionately one of the highest ethnic groups of children excluded from school. The parents recount a pattern of cumulative negative experiences which for many of the children results in academic underachievement and becoming demotivated to learn, by a system that they feel has rejected them, or imposed exclusion. The story is hardly new but it provides important further evidence that schools need to tackle head-on factors such as low teacher expectations and negative stereotyping of young black people and their contribution to black underachievement.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Nash, Roy</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The existence of social differences in educational achievement as a social fact presents the sociology of education with a challenge to which it has responded with indifferent success. It is argued that contemporary explanations that dismiss the existence and relevance of differences in cognitive performance arising as a consequence of class variation in socialisation are likely to misrepresent the real causes of inequality/difference. The substantive discussion, organised around six questions dealing with the explanatory capacity of this concept, suggests that a satisfactory theory of inequality of educational opportunity will need to concern itself with the effects of socialisation on cognition. Some implications for educational practice and policy-making are briefly noted in conclusion.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lapping, Claudia</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Based on data drawn from an empirical research project in four UK universities, this article presents a picture of student positions in undergraduate classes as a product of the relationship between the discursive fields of discipline, institution and gender. It begins by providing a description of some contrasting features of academic disciplines, and then identifies ways in which these features conflict with features of other discursive fields, to marginalise specific students or groups of students. The article draws on the conceptual vocabulary of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe to argue that where features of discursive fields overlap, social identities are overdetermined, while where features of discursive fields conflict, social identities are placed in an antagonistic and unstable relation to social and symbolic systems.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines the social meaning of subject choice in the post-16 context through a case study of Media Studies in a selective school. Students' accounts are discussed in terms of both their enjoyment of the subject and their negotiation of its &amp;quot;legitimacy&amp;quot;. The analysis of their comments in interviews stresses the subject's precarious position in a school where a relatively traditional hierarchy of subjects still prevails. It also considers the strength of family &amp;quot;projects&amp;quot; in framing children's educational &amp;quot;choices&amp;quot;. Media Studies is discussed as a negotiable option primarily facilitating projections into a new middle-class sense of self-hood.</str>

      <str>Pattman, Rob</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores the ways in which sixth-form students in Milton Keynes negotiate their identities and the symbolic significance they attach to leisure activities in the process of doing this. The paper draws upon qualitative, young-person-centred interviews with sixth formers in state and private schools. It addresses the investments of sixth formers in constructing themselves as autonomous individuals and argue that they do so from a position of middle-class subjects-in-the-making. Through an inversion of Willis' (1977) focus, the concern is to make explicit the implicitly middle-class identities sixth formers were forging. It is argued that the identity-work of sixth formers plays a part in the reproduction of school-based class inequalities by pathologising working-class students while constructing themselves as bourgeois liberal individuals.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Beastall, Liz</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The Department for Education and Skills currently shows a high regard for the potential of technology transforming the British education system. Government White papers demonstrate e-learning based unification strategies that reinforce the message that introducing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) will raise standards in schools. This paper examines the effect of these developments on teachers and pupils, and questions the government's motivation for change. The introduction of ICT has not been complemented by increased levels of effective professional development for teaching staff in the pedagogy of ICT across the curriculum and may have merely served to reinforce the generational digital divide. In attempting to enchant the pupils, the  government may have alienated the teachers. This paper suggests that the Department for Education and Skills should place more emphasis on developing strategies and providing funding for solutions to gaps in the professional development of teachers in their pedagogical understanding of ICT across the curriculum.</str>

    <str name="description">This article is based on research with a group of one-year Postgraduate Certificate in Education secondary trainee teachers during their initial teacher education and training in England. It considers tensions between trainees' prior experiences and conceptions of teaching and their training programme. In doing so, it seeks to examine how a trainee's dispositions as revealed through practice in various contexts are reflective of Bourdieu's &amp;quot;habitus&amp;quot;. Associated with this, the paper also examines how particular forms of pre-existing cultural capital and manifestations of biographical identity also pre-dispose trainees to form affinities and disaffinities within particular fields. Lacanian concepts of the symbolic, imaginary and real are used to help explain how trainee teachers articulate resonance and dissonance during their field experiences, particularly in relation to ontological concerns of securing a professional stable sense of self.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Many contemporary sociologists suggest that a feature of modern life is that the practices and identities associated with &amp;quot;place&amp;quot; are eroded. The local no longer matters in everyday life as it once did. Some national governments are persuaded of the possibility of an urban dystopia of Orwellian dimensions, and have found a response in theories and rhetorics of social capital, citizenship and communitarianism. They have instituted strategies to address an imaginary of harmonious local communities. This paper examines one such government intervention and shows how four schools in Tasmania, Australia, took up the invitation to strengthen ties with their local communities. The projects reveal that the local still exists and matters, but they also hint at other possibilities. It is argued that by working with a &amp;quot;place-based&amp;quot; curriculum to assist young people in building local networks and engaging productively with their local neighbourhoods, schools might provide important resources for identity-building and learning.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Gorard, Stephen</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">There is a misconception among social scientists that statistical analysis is somehow a technical, essentially objective, process of decision-making, whereas other forms of data analysis are judgement-based, subjective and far from technical. This paper focuses on the former part of the misconception, showing, rather, that statistical analysis relies on judgement of the most personal and non-technical kind. Therefore, the key to reporting such analyses, and persuading others of ones' findings, is the clarification and discussion of those judgements and their (attempted) justifications. In this way, statistical analysis is no different from the analysis of other forms of data, especially those forms often referred to as "qualitative." By creating an artificial schism based on the kinds of data we use, the misconception leads to neglect of the similar logic underlying all approaches to research, encourages mono-method research identities, and so inhibits the use of mixed methods.</str>

    <str name="title">Higher Education and Linguistic Dualism in the Arab Gulf</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Findlow, Sally</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines the spread of English as a medium of higher education in the Arab world, addressing questions about the relationship between higher education, language shift and cultural (re)production through such post-colonial educational bilingualism. Drawing on exploratory ethnographic research, it documents how both Arabic and English have been implicated in the reconfiguring of collective identities through mass higher education in one Arab Gulf country against a context of rapid modernisation with a regional undercurrent of recurrent pan-Arab and Islamist-tinged nationalism. It examines how far the resulting linguistic-cultural dualism amounts to a loss of linguistic-cultural diversity, and how far there is a linguistically-framed discourse of resistance to such a process. Theoretically, the paper engages with discourses relating to socio-cultural reproduction, collective identity, educational standardisation, change and cultural chauvinism, and markets. It offers insights into the potential for both language and higher education to act as tools or fields for cultural transformation and for resistance identity construction.</str>

    <str name="title">Between Tradition and Modernization: Understanding the Problem of Female Bedouin Dropouts</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Abu-Rabia-Queder, Sarab</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This study discusses the problem of Bedouin girls dropping out from the public school system in the Negev region of Israel. Data show that this phenomenon results from a conflict between the modern Israeli institutes' perception of modernity (which promote coeducation) and the Bedouin traditions that remain the cultural ethos of the girls' fathers. Israeli institutions' perception of modernity (enlightenment theory) aims to modernize the Bedouins according to Israel's modern principles, thus revoking traditional Bedouin values (sex separation). This paper promotes a post-modern theory that calls for embedding feminine traditional values of local communities as a necessary process in the development of modernity.</str>

    <str name="description">Systems designed to ensure that teaching and student learning are of a suitable quality are a feature of universities globally. Quality assurance systems are central to attempts to internationalise higher education, motivated in part by a concern for greater global equality. Yet, if such systems incorporate comparisons, the tendency is to reflect and reproduce inequalities in higher education. Highlighting the European context, we argue that, if higher education is to play a part in tackling social inequalities, we must seek alternative methods to explore pedagogic quality in institutional settings. The sociologist Basil Bernstein's concepts of &amp;quot;classification&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;framing&amp;quot; provide an illustration of the potential of sociologically informed, qualitative approaches for exploring and improving higher education pedagogy and also for addressing social justice issues: these two concepts are used to analyse documentation about undergraduate sociology in two universities that have quite different reputations within the English and Northern Irish higher education system.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Barron, Ian</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This study is concerned with experiences of ethnic identity amongst a group of three-year-old and four-year-old children, four-fifths of whom are of Pakistani heritage and the remainder of white indigenous heritage. Focused on a nursery school in the United Kingdom, the study explores the relationship between the individual and the social and cultural, initially in the home and then as the children start nursery school. An ethnographic approach is used to record the children's daily experiences and relationships as contexts where they reveal, shape and reshape who they are. Children's ethnic identities are explored in relation to boundaries where different communities of practice collide, alongside other aspects such as gender and sexuality and under the influence of factors such as power and religion. What appears to emerge is a sense of ethnic identity as social practice and performance rather than as the result of maturation or of internal cognitive development.</str>

    <str name="title">Reconstructed Task Orientation and Local Time Governance in Compulsory Schools: The Swedish Case</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Westlund, Ingrid</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Recently, a five-year trial period without a set timetable for compulsory school education in 79 municipalities was concluded in Sweden. The overall idea of the trial was to facilitate local participation, local time governance and flexible learning. Within the pilot trial, each individual pupil's school activities were supposed to be designed to suit his/her needs, interests and prerequisites. This article examines how teachers, principals and students describe students' schoolwork as being located in the intersection between school/home, work/leisure, time/task and individual/collective spheres. Three empirical studies indicate that the essential part of new temporal habits of school concerns a reconstructed task orientation. Time has been taken into the service of tasks and clock-time is not always a taken for granted regulator in educational settings. Potential disadvantages with a more task-oriented education are also discussed.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Theorists of friendship in contemporary society have suggested that our relationships with peers are characterised by their emphasis on openness, disclosure and emotional communication. Moreover, Beck and Beck-Gernsheim argue that friendship, as a deliberately sought, trusting partnership between two people, can play an important role in countering some of the negative consequences of a market-driven society, &amp;quot;acting as a shared lifeline to take the weight of each other's confusions and weaknesses&amp;quot;. However, drawing on a series of in-depth interviews with students from nine different higher education institutions, this paper will argue that such theorists overlook significant complexity in the ways in which young adults choose to &amp;quot;order&amp;quot; their friendships. Indeed, it will suggest that highly individualised and ruthlessly competitive approaches to academic study can be maintained alongside more socially cooperative relationships with friends and peers, played out in non-academic arenas. The paper will discuss the implications of this for both sociological theorising about friendship, and policy and practice within the higher education sector. (Contains 2 notes.)

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines the organization and representation of time in certain kinds of undergraduate programs, here represented by a sociology program in a US university. Written requirements for the major are analyzed as constituting a "chart" that defines academic time in terms of units of before-after relationships. The paper shows how students "reuse" these temporal units when charting paths through the university and reckoning their academic work to specific futures. (Contains 9 notes.)</str>

      <str>Christou, Miranda</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines arguments about the teaching of history in Cyprus, especially as they relate to the cultivation of patriotism. I point out how the narratives of &amp;quot;sacred history&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dangerous memories&amp;quot; are discursive elements of a pedagogy that aims at maintaining patriotism by preventing subjective and divisive personal memories from eroding a cohesive national narrative. Along with other linguistic strategies (&amp;quot;passions of the past&amp;quot;), these discourses allow an idealization of history and a rejection of subjective, personal memory. I argue that this contributes to viewing history as a distant entity and not as a field of action, something that ultimately works against the purported goal of sustaining patriotism.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Watkins, Megan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The teacher's body has a dubious status within contemporary pedagogic practice. The impact of progressivism in many western countries, with its emphasis on student-centred learning, has resulted in a marginalisation of the teacher's role in many classrooms. While its influence appears to be waning, in Australian primary schools, student-centred methodologies such as group-based and independent learning tend to dominate classroom practice. Relegated to the role of facilitator the teacher's overall presence and bodily impact in classrooms has been greatly reduced. Drawing on a study of the practice of two kindergarten teachers in two schools in Sydney, Australia, this article will examine the ways in which they embody pedagogic space, the regimen they create and the techniques they employ in teaching their students how to write. In a sense the title &amp;quot;Disparate bodies&amp;quot; has a dual focus. Not only does it relate to the different ways in which the two teachers deploy their bodies in the classroom, it also refers to the differential embodiment of their students which results from the affects that their teachers' pedagogies engender.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Symeou, Loizos</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper presents the findings of a study which explored teacher-family collaboration in state primary schools in Cyprus. The research strategy was one of multiple case study, with a sample of seven teachers, their pupils and the pupils' parents. The research approach was ethnographic and the data set reported in this paper includes the data collected from the field of two of the sites. The analysis of the data showed that participant parents, regardless of their background, valued their children's educational success, wanted their children to do well in school, and correspondingly saw themselves as supporting their children in one way or another. The evidence, however, demonstrated a variation in familial perspectives and needs and a considerable distinction in how families of different background used their school contacts. These conclusions draw on Bourdieu's views of cultural capital and seem quite consistent with the findings of other researchers elsewhere.</str>

In such a world of many important transformations, the construction of youth and gender identities is, without any doubt, a gripping topic. The past generation's referents are not always a support; to the contrary, they are more often a hurdle that needs to be overcome in order to adapt to the new society. However, only through empirical research is it possible to find out to what degree these new processes are in play, as well as the specific forms adopted by these processes that are always located in space and time. This is exactly what the three works that the author comments on accomplish. The three of them concentrate on how young people in their secondary school years shape their subjectivity within a neoliberal context. These works stress the repercussions of a more and more competitive and achievement-centered educational system for young people. The books also consider that social relationships among youngsters are a very important aspect of school life and that they constitute a vital area of knowledge that needs to be included in any understanding of students' everyday school lives. These studies also seek to examine the processes that these young people go through in a context of "self-culture" (Rose, 1999) in order to form their subjectivities, and critically investigate how the social production of inequalities takes place through them. [The three books covered in this review essay are: Making Modern Lives: Subjectivity, Schooling and Social Change (J. McLeod and L. Yates, 2006); Lads and Ladettes in School, Gender and Fear of Failure (C. Jackson, 2006; and Masculinity Beyond the Metropolis (J. Kenway, A. Kraack &amp; A. Hickey-Moody, 2006).]</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores the ways two young women, living in Australia, make sense of themselves, their activities, and futures. The two young women come from two different schooling contexts - a prestigious private school and a government school. The authors analyze their self-narratives in relation to neoliberal discourse, and consider how, and with what effects, their school contexts privilege and make available neoliberal discourses, and work to produce different subjectivities and notions of &amp;quot;worthwhile&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; lives. Conceptualizing schools as sites of subjection, the authors analyze the discourses that their respective schools make available to the young women, and how they have appropriated them. The authors suggest that the different exposure and access to neoliberal discourses position the women very differently in terms of future possibilities and work-life scenarios in the neoliberal economy. In that way, the article seeks to make a contribution towards understanding schools as implicated in social (re)production and in the (re)production of classed subjectivities.</str>

    <str name="title">How Does Social Background Affect the Grades and Grade Careers of Norwegian Economics Students?</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Helland, Havard</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The article examines how social background characteristics affect the academic achievement and grade careers of Norwegian economics students. The analyses show that the parents' social class is of great importance for the offspring's grades. Students with parents who are academics perform better than their fellow students of working-class background, on each stage of their university career. The differences are smallest at the preparatory level, and biggest at the master's level. At the last stage of the educational career, students with economist parents outperform other students with similar class backgrounds. The effects of social background are not constant throughout the educational career of economists. Rather, they seem to increase. Appendix 1 contains standardized grades and descriptives of the independent variables in tabular form. (Contains 2 tables and 5 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">

    <str name="description">This paper reports on the social factors influencing the learning of two cohorts of school students and their experience of compulsory secondary education in a city in southern England - the secondary schooling phase of a 12-year, longitudinal ethnographic study that also tracked the same children's experiences through primary schooling. We embed our report of secondary school findings within the theoretical models and understandings generated by the &amp;quot;Identity and Learning Programme&amp;quot; as a whole.The paper addresses three key issues. First, the authors  trace how social influences on learning broaden as young people develop through adolescence, and illustrate why viewing learning as social activity is so important. Second, the authors discuss evolving processes of social differentiation in relation to gender and social class. They draw particular attention to the dangers of over-simplified models of social reproduction. Finally, the authors review an analysis of strategic action and identities, contrasting the differentiated experience of young people attending independent and selective schools compared with those attending non-selective comprehensive schools. Overall, this analysis seeks to complement studies of differentiated educational outcomes by suggesting possible social processes that could help to account for them. The &amp;quot;Identity and Learning Programme,&amp;quot; both in its secondary phase and as a whole, shows clearly how individual agency enables young people to cope with their circumstances. However, in so doing, they both reproduce elements of constraint/opportunity and construct others anew. This has significant implications for policy and practice.

    <str name="title">Feeling 10 Feet Tall: Creative Inclusion in a Community of Practice</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Miles, Steven</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper explores the potential role of creative learning in helping to create positive experiences for socially excluded young people. Noting the increased influence of the market into education and the onus engendered in the 'Third Way', which seeks to give socially and economically marginal individuals the opportunity to adapt to changing economic conditions, while neglecting the underlying causes of exclusion, the paper focuses on a group of 14-18 year olds' experience of performance-based training as part of a government-funded Creative Partnerships project in Durham/Sunderland. The paper argues that creative learning cannot provide a solution to the ills of educational disadvantage, but that its untapped potential lies in its ability to provide a "community of practice" in which an individual can take personal ownership of his or her own learning experience in a communal context.</str>

      <str>Vongalis-Macrow, Athena</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Analysis of teachers' agency as multifarious change, embedded in educational reform in the global era, stands largely unexamined in educational policy. Although the concept of teachers as agents has political implications, beyond this, examining teachers' agency offers ways of describing and reviewing changes to teachers' work and relations within evolving education systems. Local systems draw from globally orientated education policies, which continue to influence to the way that local systems redesign education. In the global context, education systems are complex interactions between structure and agency, evidenced as 'multiplicity undergoing change'. In other words, there is dynamic and dialectic interplay between structure and agency. Teachers' agency, germane to dynamic interplay, means that teachers are not only engaging in the reproduction of structural change aligning globalization-driven reforms to their work and practice, but also, in adapting and reacting to new structural conditions, they are transformed through their actions. In this paper, the focus becomes teachers' agency as a framework for understanding how teachers are redesigned and reassembled to do things differently within restructured education systems. Finally, the discussion considers the possible consequences of teachers work and practice, given teachers' agency relative to the macro policy of superfigures and the transitional national/global structures.</str>

      <str>Burke, Penny Jane</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Drawing on ESRC-funded research (RES-000-22-0832), this article examines the accounts of men participating in London access and foundation programs in relation to their shifting masculine identifications. The author considers how the men's early memories of schooling shape their student masculinities. Their accounts are contextualized in relation to hegemonic discourses of widening participation and neo-liberalism. Drawing on feminist critique, she pays attention to the men's self-regulating practices in their struggle to be recognized as deserving of higher education access and participation. The interconnections and contradictions within men's identifications across a range of differences are considered in relation to their experiences and imaginaries of accessing higher education.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>O'Brien, Maeve</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper is concerned with the inequalities experienced by mothers in the performance of educational care work for their children. It is argued that the caring work carried out by mothers at transfer to second-level schooling is shaped by their ability to activate the significant resource of emotional capital; a gendered resource involving emotional skills, knowledge and experiences. Drawing on an in-depth study of mothers' routines of care, it is suggested that the possession of emotional capital subjects mothers to a normative order of care. Moreover, in exploring the idiosyncratic differences between mothers' capacities to activate emotional capital it is argued that the activation of this care resource is facilitated in the context of solidary relationships but also by mothers' access to other capitals. It is concluded that in order to tackle care inequalities those working in education need to recognise the significance of emotional resources, and need to challenge traditional codes of practice and policies around &amp;quot;parental&amp;quot; involvement.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Booher-Jennings, Jennifer</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Although high-stakes tests play an increasing role in students' schooling experiences, scholars have not examined these tests as sites for socialisation. Drawing on qualitative data collected at an American urban primary school, this study explores what educators teach students about motivation and effort through high-stakes testing, how students interpret and internalise these messages, and how student hierarchies develop as a result. I found that teachers located boys' failure in their poor behavior and attitudes, while arguing that girls simply needed more self-esteem to pass the test. Most boys accepted their teachers' diagnosis of the problem. However, the boys who felt that they were already "doing their best" and "working hard" began to doubt that educational success is a function of merit and effort. I conclude that students learn about much more than the three Rs through their experiences with high-stakes testing, and argue that future research should attend to the social dimensions of these experiences.

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Black boys in the United Kingdom and the USA have almost become synonymous with the concept of &amp;quot;underachievement&amp;quot;. However, many Black boys are achieving against the odds. Whilst the possession of a high degree of dominant cultural capital is widely recognised as a key contributory factor to academic achievement, the contributory role of other forms of non-dominant capital is often overlooked. This qualitative study of educationally successful Black males in the United Kingdom and the USA, involving 40 Black male students from both new and ancient universities, set out to establish whether religion was a contributory factor to the educational success of Black male students. The study found that most of these students were religious and that their church community engineered cultural and social capital and their belief in God engineered religious capital, all of which made significant contributions to these Black male students' academic achievement.</str>

The central contention of the paper, which takes English education and training (or "learning") as a case in point, is that in a new market-state formation the pursuit of short-term goals is tied to the global free-market economy over which any attempt at democratic control has been relinquished. At a time when humanity worldwide faces increasing change in the ecology that sustains it, this is considered to be "ecocidally insane" and the opposite of any sort of learning from experience to alter behaviour in the future. The re-regulated new global market is seen in conclusion as a crisis response to the end of the previous Keynesian welfare nation-state formation. As such, it is argued to be unsustainable in any sense.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Middleton, Sue</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Recent restructuring of research funding for New Zealand's higher education institutions is &amp;quot;outputs-driven.&amp;quot; Under the Performance Based Research Fund, units of assessment of research quality are individuals, every degree teacher receiving a confidential score of A, B or C (if deemed &amp;quot;research active&amp;quot;) or &amp;quot;R&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Research Inactive&amp;quot;). Despite its relatively high number of A and B rated individuals, Education's collective ranking was low. I interviewed staff and draw on Bernstein to explore how this process affects professional identity formation, a process involving engagement with changing &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; external identities. I overview Bernsteinian concepts, historicise Education's changing official identities and illustrate how these enabled and constrained participants' self-definitions before, during, and immediately after, the quality evaluation. The imposition of audit culture reproduces old theory/practice binaries. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Stevens, Peter A. J.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article employs ethnographic data gathered from one Belgian (Flemish) secondary school to explore the meaning Belgian and Turkish-speaking minority pupils enrolled in technical and vocational education attach to teacher racism and racial discrimination, and to explore variations between pupils in making claims of teacher racism. A symbolic interactionist framework is employed to explore how pupils define teacher racism and how a particular context and interactions between pupils and teachers informs pupils' perceptions of racism. This article builds on a strong research tradition in British sociology of education on racism and discrimination by focusing the analysis on pupils' perceptions of such incidents and by investigating how racism is experienced by a generally neglected group of Turkish minority pupils in a particular Belgian education context.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Pinson, Halleli</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper explores the ways in which Arab/Palestinian high school students in Israel negotiate their civic and national identities. The paper draws upon qualitative data that included semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 20 students in an Arab Muslim high school. It focuses on the ways in which they make sense of the notion of citizenship and negotiate their position as Arab/Palestinian Muslim citizens in a Jewish state. The paper attempts to go beyond common conceptualisations of political identities of the Arab/Palestinian minority in Israel. It suggests that Arab/Palestinian students are aware of the politics of citizenship in Israel and draw upon different discourses of citizenship and meanings of inclusion in defining their belongings.

    <str name="title">Theorising Teacher Professionalism as an Enacted Discourse of Power</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Hilferty, Fiona</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In this article I elaborate a theoretical framework for examining teacher professionalism as an enacted discourse of power. Central to this framework is an understanding of professionalism as a process that relates to the ways teachers attempt to influence the quality and character of their work. For subject teaching associations this process connects to issues of power such as teacher participation in educational policy-making, and the advocacy of subject interests. In this article I theorise professionalism as enacted by subject teaching associations, arguing that the enacted form is shaped by changing structural, cultural and agential variables. Finally, I explore the interactive relationship between structure, culture and agency in the work of subject teaching associations, and present a working model through which enacted professionalism may be analysed and interpreted.

      <str>Gewirtz, Sharon</str>
      <str>Cribb, Alan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In this paper Gewirtz and Cribb offer a response to Hammersley and Abraham's criticisms of their arguments about the place of values in social research published in this issue of BJSE. In doing so, they make clear that most of the positions that Hammersley and Abraham attribute to them are ones that they do not identify with and that, like Hammersley and Abraham, they would reject. In order to further clarify and specify their own position, Gewirtz and Cribb argue that: their advocacy of ethical reflexivity rests on the assumption that there are many incompatible sets of values in play within even a single vantage point; researchers should sometimes take an interest in knowledge use although they should not always be required to do so; and, whilst at the level of propositions it is always possible to abstract out and distinguish between factual claims and value claims, at the level of practice there can be significant resonances and linkages between the two, so it is important to be ethically reflexive about these entanglements. Finally, the authors agree that values should not be seen purely as a source of contamination but that attention to values can help to underpin &amp;quot;objectivity&amp;quot;.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Ringrose, Jessica</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The present paper explores the conceptual limitations of the bully discourses that ground UK anti-bullying policy frameworks and psychological research literatures on school bullying, suggesting they largely ignore gender, (hetero)sexuality and the social, cultural and subjective dynamics of conflict and aggression among teen-aged girls. To explore the limitations of bully discourses in practice, the paper draws on a pilot, interview-based study of girls' experiences of aggression and bullying, illustrating how friendships and conflicts among the girls are thoroughly heterosexualized, en-cultured and classed. Drawing on girls and parent interview narratives, I also trace some of the effects of bully discourses set in motion in schools to intervene into conflicts among girls. I suggest these practices miss the complexity of the dynamics at play among girls and also neglect the power relations of parenting, ethnicity, class and school choice, which can inform how, why and when bullying discourses are mobilized.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Shah, Saeeda</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The student population across world is increasingly reflective of diverse cultures, religions and ethnicities. This rich diversity may become a challenge for educational leaders, teachers, and policy-makers in the absence of an understanding of diverse sources of knowledge people draw on for directing their beliefs and daily practices. This paper explores the multi-ethnic context in Britain with a focus on Muslim students in English secondary schools, and argues for drawing on diverse ethnic knowledge sources to inform and enrich approaches towards managing diversity. It discusses the concept of &amp;quot;Adab&amp;quot; derived from Muslim ethics and philosophy, and debates possible contributions of such conceptual adaptations towards improving educational engagement and performance.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Themelis, Spyros</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">After the Second World War, education in advanced capitalist societies has been perceived as the main &amp;quot;saviour&amp;quot; of the meritocratic ideal. In this paper I will investigate some of the implications of the lasting emphasis that has been placed upon education in Britain, in the pursuit of a more just and equal society. Initially, I will present two main strands of thought vis-a-vis meritocracy. I will then show how these different approaches have shaped the pertinent debate. The main line of reasoning will be that the &amp;quot;meritocracy through education&amp;quot; discourse can potentially conceal inequalities and injustices in contemporary market-driven British society. This contention will be supported by evidence from social mobility research, which clearly indicates that the expansion of educational provision and the increase in educational qualifications of the past 60 years has done little to eliminate social class differences and associated privileges.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Abraham, John</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The present article examines the relationship between political values and social research, with particular reference to the case for ethical reflexivity in sociology of education put forward by Gewirtz and Cribb. It is argued that their case for such reflexivity is flawed by conceptual imprecision and over-determination of the links between value commitments, knowledge and the political implications of research. Drawing on a case study of a controversy in sociology of education, combined with a more discriminating conceptual analysis of political values in social research, it is suggested that the Gewirtz-Cribb "manifesto" for routine ethical reflexivity may be inefficient and impractical. An alternative way of thinking about political reflexivity in sociology of education is offered, as are some possible avenues of philosophical resolution between the main protagonists of the longstanding debate on "what to do about values" in sociology of education.

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article is a reply to Gewirtz and Cribb's argument for ethical reflexivity, presented in a previous issue of this journal. These authors compared their views with mine, suggesting a way in which the differences between our positions could be overcome. I argue that, while there is certainly substantial agreement, there are also some fundamental differences between us, notably about the goal of research. Indeed, in my view, what they recommend involves a greatly increased danger of bias and a version of scientism. At issue here is, in large part, the &amp;quot;kind&amp;quot; of ethical reflexivity that is appropriate in sociological work. (Contains 8 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">Addressing the &amp;quot;the social class attainment gap&amp;quot; in education has become a government priority in England. Despite multiple initiatives, however, little has effectively addressed the underachievement of working-class pupils within the classroom. In order to develop clearer understandings of working-class underachievement at this level, this small research study focused on local social processes by exploring how secondary school teachers identified and addressed underachievement in their classrooms. Our analysis shows how teachers' identifications of underachieving pupils overlapped with, and were informed by, their tacit understanding of pupils' social class position. While many teachers resisted the influence of social class, they used stereotypes to justify their practice and expectations, positioning pupils within educational and occupational hierarchies. This, we conclude, suggests the need for more systematic attention to the micro-social processes that provide the conditions through which working-class underachievement is produced.

    <str name="description">In this article, we examine the social dimension of inequality in educational participation. We look at the social transmission and gender-specific channelling of education and further training in the context of employment and family. Based on quantitative survey data and qualitative interview data collected from a multi-level empirical life-course study (Hamburg Biographical and Life-Course Panel: 1980-2006) conducted with a sample of the 1979 cohort of secondary school graduates in Hamburg, Germany, we discuss the education and further training practices in their lives--with special emphasis on social class of origin and gender.

    </arr>
    <str name="description">While the research, theory and policy literature on race, class and gender discrimination in education is extensive, the problem of education-based discrimination itself has been widely overlooked. Indeed, the dominant ideologies of meritocracy and human capital (into which we are inculcated throughout our lives by schools, media and the state) proclaim that higher levels of education are and should be linked with greater reward. In a world where education is regularly invoked to legitimate inequality, it can appear nonsensical even to raise concern about education-based discrimination as a matter of social injustice. We need, however, to challenge those who have taught us not to see what has essentially become an elephant in our living room. Otherwise, we will find ourselves unable ever to use our public systems of education for universal emancipation and empowerment.</str>

    <str name="title">Underperformance or &amp;quot;Getting It Right&amp;quot;? Constructions of Gender and Achievement in the Australian Inquiry into Boys' Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Hodgetts, Katherine</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The underachievement of boys has been a focus of intense concern in Australia for over 15 years. Historical analyses suggest that male students' poor performance has traditionally been attributed to factors external to boys themselves (methods, teachers, texts), deflecting attention from the relationship between masculinity construction and successful engagement with school. This paper turns the focus back, addressing the ways in which gender itself was constructed within hearings held for the Australian Parliamentary Inquiry into Boys' Education. Discursive analysis demonstrates that witnesses to the Inquiry drew upon a series of gender binaries in representing male and female students, and accounting for their relative attainment. These binaries worked to associate masculinity with &amp;quot;authentic&amp;quot; learning, such that the success of male students was naturalised even in the absence of achievement. Conversely, the association of femininity and &amp;quot;inauthentic learning&amp;quot; worked to undermine female students' demonstrated success. The role of these binaries in the reproduction of a paradoxical relationship between gender and achievement is discussed.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper presents research findings from an ethnographic study carried out with 24 low-income youths (ages 14-16) living on the economic fringes of urban inner-city Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Our primary aims are: to expose the stratified subcultural articulations of citizenship as they are expressed, through language and symbol, by the young people within our study; and to demonstrate how critiques of (neo-)liberalism in political thought, when combined with a cultural sociology of youth, might alter our subcultural reading of young people's conceptions of citizenship under the dynamics of radical social change. Our ultimate goal is to develop a more nuanced sociological examination of the ways in which young people deploy and utilize the language of citizenship as part of their own cultural struggles, exacerbated in times of state retrenchment, to classify themselves and others as one method of achieving visibility and legitimacy in urban concentrations of poverty.

    <str name="description">This article provides a brief rejoinder to Gorard and Smith's reply to an article I published in a previous issue of British Journal of Sociology of Education. In that original article I provided a critical review of their quantitative research on gender and education in the United Kingdom. In their reply to this article, Gorard and Smith seem to agree with many of the points I made. However, they appear to be particularly perplexed by why I had written this review given that they feel they have already addressed most of my points elsewhere. In this brief rejoinder I explain very clearly my motivations for writing my original article and refer readers to a more detailed and comprehensive paper where I have responded fully to each and every point raised by Gorard and Smith.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">In &amp;quot;British Journal of Sociology of Education&amp;quot; Volume 29 number 3, 2008, Connolly presented what he termed a &amp;quot;critical review&amp;quot; of some of our previous work on the relative attainment of male and female students in UK schools. He proposed three general areas for criticism--our use of attainment gaps, our consideration of outcomes other than at specific thresholds, and our querying of the idea of student &amp;quot;underachievement&amp;quot;. These problems, he claimed, have &amp;quot;given rise to a number of misleading conclusions that have questionable implications for practice&amp;quot;. However, those of his &amp;quot;criticisms&amp;quot; with any merit are actually the same as our own conclusions, transmuted by Connolly from our papers that he cites, while his remaining &amp;quot;criticisms&amp;quot; are based on faulty elementary logic. In case readers have not read our work and were somehow misled by Connolly, we give here a brief reply to each criticism in turn. This matters, because a greater understanding of patterns of attainment and of the nature of underachievement is a precursor to the design of successful initiatives to overcome inequalities in educational opportunity and reward. This is both a practical and an ethical issue. (Contains 1 figure.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Au, Wayne W.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">High-stakes, standardized testing has become the central tool for educational reform and regulation in many industrialized nations in the world, and it has been implemented with particular intensity in the United States and the United Kingdom. Drawing on research on high-stakes testing and its effect on classroom practice and pedagogic discourse in the United States, the present paper applies Bernstein's concept of the pedagogic device to explain how high-stakes tests operate as a relay in the reproduction of dominant social relations in education. This analysis finds that high-stakes tests, through the structuring of knowledge, actively select and regulate student identities, and thus contribute to the selection and regulation of students' educational success.</str>

    <str name="description">The present article reports on a research project investigating the experiences of male primary teachers in Queensland, Australia. While its findings cannot be presented as indicative of all male teachers in all contexts, it does, however, send a warning to policy-makers that the employment of more male teachers may not be in the best interests of gender justice unless such strategies designed to attract more male teachers are informed by sophisticated understandings of gender and social power. Utilising a (pro) feminist post-structuralist theoretical perspective, it is demonstrated how some male teachers contribute to the maintenance of segregated work roles, which is of central importance to the continuance of gender power differentials in a patriarchal society. The research method focused on social relationships and involved a series of semi-structured/life history interviews with 11 male teachers, six female teachers, two male principals and two female principals. An important implication from this research is that the employment of male teachers must be accompanied by an awareness of how teacher practice impacts upon the socialisation of students and how such practice reinforces or contributes to change in the broader gender system.</str>

      <str>Lynch, Heather</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Recent lifelong learning policies have been criticized for creating an illusion of freedom whilst simultaneously reducing choice. The concept of desire permits engagement with the conscious and unconscious drives that underpin individual decision-making, which direct the life course. Utilizing the ideas of Hume and Spinoza, the present article articulates the interrelated nature of desire and learning. Evidence is drawn from Learning Lives, a Teaching and Learning Research Programme-funded research project that uses the life history method to explore themes of agency, identity and learning across the life course. Boltanski and Thevenot's sociology of critical capacity is used as a heuristic tool that illuminates the mechanics of desire as described by eight contributors. Their stories provide a basis from which to critique policies for lifelong learning that appear limited in relation to the multiple desires that drive their life choices. (Contains 1 figure.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Smith, Jayne</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The present paper argues that university quality assurance (QA) promotes a masculinist culture leading to systemic discrimination against female academics. The analysis relates to the question of what it is about academic life that results in persistent gender inequality. Based on an ethnographically informed comparative study, textual/discourse analysis of 30 interviewee transcripts reveals disguised messages about QA. The interpretation argued draws on a theoretical scrutiny of the covert power of a masculinist QA movement to disproportionately disadvantage female academics. The paper suggests that this has been made possible by a QA presentation discourse harnessed by male academics to manage identities. It argues that dominant definitions of the &amp;quot;competent academic&amp;quot; that discriminate against females are normalised and cemented within a societal conscience.

    </arr>
    <str name="description">The present paper aims to provide an account of the genesis and development of a collection of scientific work that has received strong international recognition--the paradigm of school effectiveness. It shows how this theory, based on the design of measurement tools, has gradually influenced educational management and policies in promoting the effectiveness and quality of educational systems. In mobilizing allies, setting up laboratories and extending its networks into major international organizations, school effectiveness research has contributed to the emergence of a new form of governance of education systems at a European level and to the promotion of new assessment methods of research in education.</str>

    <str name="title">The Marginality of Migrant Children in the Urban Chinese Educational System</str>

      <str>Wang, Lu</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The present paper explores issues of the educational marginality of migrant children in urban settings in two cities in China. The numbers of urban migrants exceed 100 million and are growing as China modernizes. This is creating tensions between residents and recent arrivals who lack residential registration and access to public services. As a result, migrant children often attend informal, private and usually unregulated schools of low quality organized by their communities. These tend to reinforce social stratification and reproduce marginality across the generations. The paper argues that state failure to provide basic education risks a growing divide between urban residents and recent migrants that has social consequences that must be addressed to remove discriminatory practices and resolve potential conflicts between hosts and migrant communities.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Read, Barbara</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The present paper examines male and female teachers' language practices in relation to "censuring" talk in the primary classroom, in the context of the debate around boys' "underachievement" and the "feminisation" of primary school culture. Through an analysis of classroom observations with 51 men and women teachers, it looks to see whether gender differences could be found in the ways individual men and women teachers communicated in terms of their "censuring" comments of pupils' work or behaviour. Secondly, the paper takes issue with the notion that teachers operate within a "feminised" educational culture, by looking at the ways in which teachers' classroom talk can be seen to be constrained by two contrasting discourses relating to the power relation between teacher and pupil: a "traditional" "disciplinarian" discourse, and a more "progressive" "liberal" discourse. Both discourses have complex gendered and class dimensions, challenging the conception of a "feminised" primary school culture. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Fejes, Andreas</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Educational guidance is often seen as something good and empowering for the individual. In the present article, such taken-for-granted ideas will be destabilised by analysing educational guidance as a practice in which confession operates as a technology that fosters and governs specific subjectivities. White papers produced by the Swedish Ministry of Education will be analysed drawing on Foucault's concepts of technologies of the self and governmentality. I shall argue that the practice of educational guidance fosters our will to learn through the technology of confession. We are not only confessing ourselves to, and are the confessors of others, we are also our own confessors; that is, we confess our inner desires to ourselves, thus participating in shaping desirable subjectivities. Our desires in life coincide with the political ambition to govern, and thus we govern ourselves. (Contains 3 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">As the largest public sector institution in the United Kingdom, education is a key site for studying the context of &amp;quot;choice&amp;quot; and changes in the identities of professional workers in contemporary society. Recruitment and retention problems in education have led to the creation of new routes into teaching to attract career changers from other professions and occupations. In this paper we focus on career changers within the Economic and Social Research Council project &amp;quot;Primary Teacher Identity, Commitment and Career in Performative School Cultures&amp;quot; who have entered teaching from other private sector occupations. We analyse these career changes in terms of &amp;quot;turning points&amp;quot; in the participants' lives in order to assess the extent to which choices are &amp;quot;self-initiated&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;forced&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;structural&amp;quot;. We are interested in the basis on which these choices were made and the impact of gender on career decisions. (Contains 1 table.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Beck, John</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The present paper examines efforts by government and government agencies in England to prescribe and control the knowledge base of a teaching profession that has, under successive New Labour administrations since 1997, been subjected to &amp;quot;modernisation&amp;quot;. A theoretical framework drawn from aspects of the work of Basil Bernstein, and of Rob Moore and Lynn Jones, is drawn upon to examine in some detail one key aspect of this ongoing process of governmental appropriation of professionalism: the specification by the Training and Development Agency for Schools of new &amp;quot;standards&amp;quot; for both initial teacher training and teachers' subsequent career progression. It is argued that although this enterprise represents itself as a species of purely common-sense reform, it is in fact a mode of competency training that is rooted in selective appropriation of elements of post-fordist management theory and a loose form of behaviourist psychology. The capacity of this training discourse to suppress awareness of its own presuppositions and of alternative or competing conceptions of professions and professionalism is explored.

    </arr>
    <str name="description">The present article extends Basil Bernstein's theorisation of &amp;quot;discourses&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;knowledge structures&amp;quot; to explore the potential of educational knowledge structures to enable or constrain cumulative learning, where students can transfer knowledge across contexts and build knowledge over time. It offers a means of overcoming dichotomies in Bernstein's model by conceptualising knowledge in terms of &amp;quot;legitimation codes&amp;quot; (bases of achievement) and &amp;quot;semantic gravity&amp;quot; (context-dependency of knowledge). This developed framework is used to analyse two contrasting examples of curriculum--from professional education at university and secondary school English--that aim to enable cumulative learning. Analyses of students' work products show that both cases can constrain knowledge-building by anchoring meaning within its context of acquisition. The basis for this potential is located in a mismatch between their aims of enabling students to learn higher-order principles and their curricular means that focus on knowers' dispositions rather than articulating principles of knowledge.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Mullen, Ann L.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">As higher education expands and becomes more differentiated, patterns of class stratification remain deeply entrenched, in part due to class-based differences in college choice. A qualitative study of 50 Yale students shows the effects of social class, high schools and peers on students' pathways to college. For students from wealthy and highly educated families, the choice of an Ivy League institution becomes normalized through the inculcated expectations of families, the explicit positioning of schools, and the peer culture. Without these advantages, less-privileged students more often place elite institutions outside the realm of the possible--in part because of concerns of elitism. These findings suggest that even low-socioeconomic status students with exceptional academic credentials must overcome substantial hurdles to arrive at an Ivy League university.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Strathdee, Rob</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The present paper raises questions about the use of the concept of reputation in sociological studies of the relationship between higher education and the labour market. Sociologists of education have yet to subject the concept of reputation to sustained critique and evaluation. This situation is unsatisfactory because a number of critical scholars claim that graduates earn a premium as a consequence of attending an elite institution for no reason other than the institution has such a reputation. However, research generally does not provide unequivocal support for such an effect and neither is the source of this effect clearly theorised or identified. One result of this lack of clarity is confusion over what is driving the formation of reputation. This paper advances field theory as a way of developing a sociology of reputation.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines the class distribution of young people, aged 16-17 years, in colleges of further education (FE) using data from the Youth Cohort Study. It finds that, contrary to popular perceptions of FE colleges as being for &amp;quot;other people's children&amp;quot;, middle-class students as well as working-class students are well represented. However, this does not imply that FE colleges are institutions of choice; middle-class representation is often related to lower achievement and, for low-achieving working-class students, leaving education entirely is more likely than entry to FE. These findings are explored using notions of habitus and field. Their relationship with studies of the education of middle-class children is also discussed, and the paper suggests that research on class in FE colleges must come to terms with middle-class presence.

    <str name="description">The present paper explores the fascist vision for education in 1930s Britain through the presentation of extracts from official publications of the British Union of Fascists (BUF), as well as from the writings of Party members. The paper presents a socio-historical study of British adherents to fascism and provides an account of their thinking in relation to education and schooling, exposing a milieu of ideologues, Party functionaries and serving teachers who were animated by their political commitment. Following a brief outline of the early years of British fascism, there is an account of some key members and their educational ideas, followed by a discussion of the BUF's educational policies and of its approach to internal education and training. The orientation of the BUF and its membership to education, and the Party's formulated policies in this field present a modernist vision that was calculated to have particular appeal to educational professionals. There is a consideration, through memoirs, of the experiences of two BUF members who were teachers. The paper reveals a relatively hidden episode in the social history of British educational politics; one that contained paradoxes of intent and outcome, and of means and ends, when ostensibly progressive and socially elevating concepts were employed in ways that had an ultimately destructive impact on individuals, both personally and professionally, as well as on whole societies.</str>

    <str name="description">Judith Butler's philosophical writings on identity have provided inspiring, if occasionally "troubling", ways of rethinking gender. A key contribution has been the challenge to conventional social constructionist ideas and thinking on subjectivity. In developing a paradigm of performativity, Butler's work takes us beyond the territory of identity secured in much previous feminist poststructuralist debate. She does so in part by providing an ontological critique--a type of "queering" if you will--of such seemingly knowable categories as "man", "woman", "girl" or "boy". In addressing the radical interruption in identity theorising offered in Butler's writing, we consider the arresting claim that identity is a type of "doing" that is only made manifest at the point of action. To explore the theoretical, empirical and political issues at stake, we draw especially upon Butler's writings on identity and ally this to some of our own ethnographic research on gender, youth and schooling. Here, we explore young people's compulsion to enact and display stylised forms of gender embodiment, and the spectacular enactments of transgression that can elicit a practice of gender dissimulation. Our focus is upon the subversion, regulation and embodiment of gender identities and its implications for the sociology of education. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    <str name="description">This paper draws on Judith Butler's notion of &amp;quot;gender melancholia&amp;quot; as conceived in &amp;quot;The Psychic Life of Power: Theories in Subjection,&amp;quot; and Emmanuel Levinas' notion of the face of the other mobilized in Butlers' more recent work. In particular, I will focus on gender melancholia in order to consider why non-heteronormative identities might cause such consternation when they appear in a specific pedagogical context. I also consider how the notion of gender melancholia may be useful in gaining a more in-depth understanding of the prohibitions placed on the production and dissemination of texts that introduce young children to non-normative representations of sexual and gender identity. In addition, the Levinasian notion of the face, as mobilized by Butler, prompts a consideration of the ethical implications of having certain faces that appear to be unrepresentable in particular pedagogical domains.

    <str name="description">In this paper I explore the process of subjectification (sometimes also called subjectivation, or simply, subjection) through which one becomes a subject--a process that Butler describes in terms of simultaneous mastery and submission, entailing a necessary vulnerability to the other in order to be. I examine the conceptual work Butler has undertaken to extend the Foucauldian concept of subjectification, and I draw on some encounters between teachers and their students in order to make these processes of subjectification understandable in the context of education. I conclude the paper with some notes toward an ethics of classroom practice. (Contains 3 notes.)</str>

    <str name="title">Subjectivation and Performative Politics--Butler Thinking Althusser and Foucault: Intelligibility, Agency and the Raced-Nationed-Religioned Subjects of Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Youdell, Deborah</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Judith Butler is perhaps best known for her take-up of the debate between Derrida and Austin over the function of the performative and her subsequent suggestion that the subject be understood as performatively constituted. Another important but less often noted move within Butler's consideration of the processes through which the subject is constituted is her thinking between Althusser's notion of subjection and Foucault's notion of subjectivation. In this paper, I explore Butler's understanding of processes of subjectivation, examine the relationship between subjectivation and the performative suggested in and by Butler's work, and consider how the performative is implicated in processes of subjectivation--in &amp;quot;who&amp;quot; the subject is, or might be, subjectivated as. Finally, I examine the usefulness of understanding the subjectivating effects of discourse for education, in particular for educationalists concerned to make better sense of and interrupt educational inequalities. In doing this I offer a reading of an episode of ethnographic data generated in an Australian high school. I suggest that it is through subjectivating processes of the sort that Butler helps us to understand that some students are rendered subjects inside the educational endeavour, and others are rendered outside this endeavour or, indeed, outside student-hood.

    <str name="title">The Politics of Performative Resignification: Translating Judith Butler's Theoretical Discourse and Its Potential for a Sociology of Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Hey, Valerie</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">More than any other recent social theorist, constructing a disquisition on Butler's ideas draws the writer into speculating on the formation of their own intellectual grammar, perhaps to confront the disconcerting truth of how often their own cherished analytical rationality is broken up by glimpses into the imagination of more provocative thinkers. I have come to the conclusion that it is not so much that we self-consciously assemble all of the resources for the making of research imaginaries as those vivid ideas (and frequently their authors) come to haunt us. Butler's work has been of this "disturbing" order. The "unconscious of intellectual work" is worthy of more attention than I can offer here but it is important to bear this in mind in the course of the following. In this paper I will describe the concept of "performativity" and its theoretical elaboration in "Gender Trouble," "Bodies that Matter" and subsequent and secondary texts. Performativity conceptualises the paradox of identity as apparently fixed but inherently unstable, revealing (gender) norms requiring continual maintenance. Her works thus contribute a new conceptual grammar in the inter-related concepts of performativity and citationality to denote a reading of gender not as essence nor socialisation, but as the consequence of the performative (i.e. recurring) "citations" of gender thought as actions that institute "girling," for example. Butler's insistence on seeing gender as constitutive (as literally making the material of the embodied self) signifies the social and cultural forces that come to sculpt femininity and masculinity as norms on the body and the psyche. In arguing that the Butlerian performative has complicated a reading of the discursive and material conditions of the processes of (gender) identification, I will review my own poststructuralist vocabulary with its focus on the "sociality" of subjectification as a way to interpret and interrogate the power and limitations of Butler's ideas. Despite the awkwardness entailed in transposing performativity to embodied practices of classed distinction, her work continues to expand the ethnographic imaginary. My exegesis of performativity also serves another purpose, as a methodological comment about academic praxis, as I simultaneously open up and share in the modes of translation used in coming to appreciate Butler's important and exhilarating theoretical landscape.

    <str name="title">"They Won't Let Us Play ... Unless You're Going out with One of Them": Girls, Boys and Butler's "Heterosexual Matrix" in the Primary Years</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Renold, Emma</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Judith Butler's conceptualisation of how gender is routinely spoken through a hegemonic heterosexual matrix has been pivotal for many social scientists researching within and beyond educational settings for exposing the ways in which children's normative gender identities ("intelligible genders") are inextricably tied to dominant notions of heterosexuality. In dialogue with a growing body of research queering children's gendered and sexualised childhoods, this paper addresses how being a "normal" girl or boy involves investing in and actively pursuing hegemonic heterosexual identities and relations (from sexual bullying to relationship cultures). Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork into the sexualisation of gender and the gendering of sexuality in children's identity-work in their final year of primary school, I explore the ways in which a ubiquitous heterosexual matrix regulates boy-girl intimacies, from play and friendships to physical proximity. I also highlight the diverse and fluid ways in which children deploy discourses of (hetero)romance and sexual innocence in their role as "girlfriends" and "boyfriends," and how particular gendered subject positions (e.g. tomboy) offer an escape route from coercive and frequently compulsory heterosexual positionings. The paper concludes by highlighting how queer analyses of children's gendered and sexual cultures and identity-work needs to further scrutinise how discourses of generation (e.g. early or middle childhood) intersect with discourses of gender and sexuality.

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines issues of selection, merging an analysis of policy with data from a qualitative case study. It focuses on the &amp;quot;modernisation of the comprehensive principle&amp;quot; proposed by New Labour, in which selection within schools (through setting &amp;quot;by ability&amp;quot;) is increasingly encouraged. Data collected at an inner-city, multi-ethnic comprehensive school are used to illustrate how discourses on selection are being reworked locally. The school was largely supportive of setting, despite some teachers acknowledging that the practice prioritised high-achieving pupils with perceived &amp;quot;good attitudes&amp;quot;. In the form under study, setting involved disadvantaged pupils from ethnic-minority backgrounds, particularly those who received support in English as an Additional Language. It is concluded that setting did not contribute to an inclusive agenda for education, in spite of government claims of increased &amp;quot;standards for all&amp;quot;.

      <str>Taylor, Sandra</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In this paper we draw on concepts from policy sociology to analyse the new equity deal for schools in Queensland, Australia. We examine this &amp;quot;new deal&amp;quot; through an analysis of the language of &amp;quot;inclusion&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;educational risk&amp;quot; in key policy documents associated with a major reform of public education in Queensland. In addition, we analyse the interview talk of key policy actors involved in policy framing, carriage and monitoring. We note that globalism has increased rather than reduced social inequity. At the same time, good quality accessible education can play a crucial role in challenging the inequalities produced by global informationalism. In Queensland, Australia, equity is still on the agenda, but in radically new neo-liberal economic ways. The focus is individualistic--each individual needs to be tracked because they are potentially &amp;quot;at-risk&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;school failure&amp;quot;. Identification of &amp;quot;at-risk&amp;quot; students has been devolved to the level of the school and district, and intervention strategies have to be devised at the local level. Stories of success are then to be shared/networked with other schools. We suggest that while &amp;quot;target group equity&amp;quot; strategies were limited in terms of addressing issues of social exclusion and inequity, the new deal on equity, a market-individualistic approach is an inadequate alternative.</str>

It draws on the key factors that influence retention worldwide, adopts Bourdieu's notion of cultural capital and also brings in concepts related to terrorism and security unrest traditionally absent from theories on student retention. Based on a case study carried out in Israel on 50 full-time undergraduate students, this study suggests that the difficulties created by a country's political environment alone do not play a significant role in student retention. However, when coupled with the salient features that negatively impact retention worldwide, difficulties created by a country's security situation may increase tendencies to leave or consider leaving higher education.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article aims to address concerns about schools as locations where students grapple, materially and subjectively, with class-based notions of femininity, the promotion of heterosexuality and the support of hetero-normative, middle-class families against, and in contrast with, their own working-class families, identities and experiences. Two interconnecting but relatively neglected issues in education, those of sexuality and class, are addressed in order to highlight the interconnections in living out these often analytically separated categories. While the classed, gendered and sexualised aspects of schooling have been explored by several commentators, often these do not combine in such a way to cast light upon the interconnecting inequalities faced by working-class lesbians, or the outcomes of these. This piece draws upon the findings of an empirical ESRC-funded project &amp;quot;Working-class lesbians: classed in a classless climate.&amp;quot; (Contains 7 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">This paper discusses the ways in which inner-city, ethnically diverse, working-class girls' constructions of hetero-femininities mediate and shape their dis/engagement with education and schooling. Drawing on data from a study conducted with 89 urban, working-class young people in London, attention is drawn to three main ways through which young women used heterosexual femininities to construct capital and generate identity value and worth; namely, investment in appearance through &amp;quot;glamorous&amp;quot; hetero-femininities, heterosexual relationships with boyfriends, and the &amp;quot;ladette&amp;quot; discourse. We discuss how and why young women's investments in particular forms of heterosexual working-class femininity can play into their disengagement from education and schooling, drawing particular attention to the paradoxes that arise when these constructions play into other oppressive power relations.

    <str name="description">Government support for the production and consumption of educational software is now a key element of New Labour's education technology drive. At present much attention is being directed towards marketing &amp;quot;digital learning&amp;quot; to an educational sector traditionally wary of technological innovation. In an effort to understand the social shaping of this current phase of policy-making, the present paper examines the political and commercial discourses surrounding digital learning and associated initiatives such as &amp;quot;Curriculum Online&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Digital Curriculum.&amp;quot; After analysing a range of political and commercial texts produced from 2000 to 2005, the paper explores the dominant themes emerging from these discursive constructions--considering in particular the limitations of the often ambiguous yet structured ways in which digital learning is being shaped by its key actors.

      <str>Keddie, Amanda</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper presents a longitudinal insight into the experiences of &amp;quot;Adam,&amp;quot; a young boy who lives with his single-parent father (a farmer and builder) in a rural working-class community on the outskirts of a provincial town in Tasmania, Australia. Adam's story juxtaposes my representations of him as an eight year old in 1999 and as a 12 year old in 2003. Such longitudinal analysis highlights how increasing mismatches between Adam's home and school life, and mismatches between hegemonic masculinity and formal schooling, interact to amplify issues of school disengagement and alienation. Adam's external expressions of masculinity, and in particular his concerted efforts to subvert and sabotage official school cultures and practices, are explored as issues of power, masculinity, class and rurality.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Framed within Coleman's theory of family capital, this article examines how different home variables such as family physical, human and social capital affect immigrant children's second-language acquisition in the homes of four Chinese immigrant families in Canada. Specifically, the study analyzes the relationships between family physical capital and family investment in second language learning, between parental human capital and levels of parental involvement, and between family social capital and access to familial and community resources. The analysis demonstrates that parental educational backgrounds, their occupational choices and chances, and their adaptation and integration into Canadian society had a significant impact on the families' accumulation and activation of family capital to support their children's second-language learning.

    <str name="title">Homework as Serious Family Business: Power and Subjectivity in Negotiations about School Assignments in Swedish Families</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Forsberg, Lucas</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Most previous research on parental involvement in children's homework has focused on the pedagogical advantages or disadvantages of school assignments while neglecting the practice in its social context, family life. By studying parent-child homework negotiations in Swedish families, this paper examines how family members position themselves and each other in relation to Swedish discourses on homework and parental involvement. The study shows that parents want their children to do homework independently. It is hard for the parents to take up another subject position than that of a &amp;quot;responsible parent&amp;quot; who helps the child with homework or controls that it is done. Thereby, the child is simultaneously positioned as &amp;quot;irresponsible&amp;quot; whether that is the case or not. (Contains 2 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">Here, the narratives of a group of non-traditional students who entered traditional UK universities are examined. A number of participants felt there was a kind of romance or exotic quality to the sights, sounds and smells of traditional institutions, which constituted part of the attraction. The process of becoming a student at an elite or traditional institution involved an oscillation between anxiety and ambition. Occasionally, students would become disillusioned with particular traditional universities, usually due to an act of rudeness--for example, a &amp;quot;snotty letter&amp;quot; that deflected them. Yet their choices remained within the traditional sector. The participants subscribe to what Bourdieu called the &amp;quot;doxa&amp;quot; or the largely unwritten rules of the overall game. The results confirm the recent interest in intra-class differences and affirm the need to make sense of how individuals' habituses can be transformed to accommodate the changes accompanying the move to university.

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Transformational leadership is widely recognised as being central to the implementation of educational reform. In this paper I draw on selected educational speeches made by New Labour politicians in order to locate shifting discourses of leadership within the broader accountability framework through which the terms of the relationship between central government and head teachers have been re/configured in the United Kingdom. The gendered politics of transformation are examined, highlighting new and renewed forms of masculinity embedded within new leadership ideals. It is suggested that a gendered critique of transformational leadership offers an important contribution to critical analyses of the neo-liberal and managerialist educational project.

    <str name="title">Organizational Epistemology, Education and Social Theory</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Hartley, David</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Organizational learning or epistemology has emerged in order to manage the creation of knowledge and innovation within contemporary capitalism. Its insights are being applied also to the public sector. Much of the research in organizational learning has drawn upon the discipline of psychology, particularly constructivist theory. Two approaches in organizational epistemology are considered here: Nonaka's theory of knowledge creation, and Engestrom's expansive learning theory. Notwithstanding the reference to &amp;quot;learning,&amp;quot; these approaches have so far had little application to schools, especially at the level of pedagogy. But there are indications that re-culturing, &amp;quot;workforce re-modeling&amp;quot; and inter-agency working are becoming more prominent within the public services in England. In these endeavours, government may come to regard organizational epistemology as an important new procedure in the management of change. Thus far, sociology has had two kinds of &amp;quot;relationship&amp;quot; with organizational epistemology: first, social phenomenology and ethnomethodology have been of practical use; and, second, critical theory objects to the near-absence of a consideration of power and ideology within the discourse of organizational epistemology.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Kettley, Nigel</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The provisions of the Higher Education Act (2004) have renewed interest in widening participation research. Therefore, this paper explores the development of this scholarly field, primarily in the United Kingdom, by examining major trends in the study of higher education. Political debates related to higher education, the prevailing structure of the sector and predominant sociological perspectives have largely shaped the empirical and theoretical concerns of widening participation research. These delimiting factors have resulted in incomplete accounts of the barriers to higher education, which do not fully explore the relationship between students' social characteristics, learning experiences and university careers. Furthermore, contemporary research runs the risk of reinventing the wheel and replicating the mistakes of the past, since there has been a collective act of forgetfulness with respect to earlier contributions. In contrast, this paper provides guidelines to facilitate a holistic agenda for future widening participation research.</str>

    <str name="title">The Pleasures of Learning at Work: Foucault and Phenomenology Compared</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Hughes, Christina</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper provides a comparative account of two conceptualisations of pleasure. The first draws on Foucault's analysis of bio-power. The second provides a phenomenological account where pleasure is viewed as an aspect of our immediate consciousness. These conceptualisations are illuminated through an analysis of employees' accounts of learning at work. Overall, the paper demonstrates how, in a Foucauldian analysis, pleasure disappears as it becomes a cipher for power whereas within the phenomenological account pleasure is foregrounded but power disappears. The concluding section focuses on the problems of both conceptualisations and explores whether we should simply accept that different analytical frameworks do different work for us or whether we should be more concerned at the losses, and gains, associated with theoretical choices. The conclusion further asks whether a concern to foreground pleasure in accounts of learning represents an antidote to the pessimism of much critical analysis or whether we should treat pleasure as a morally duplicitous category that encourages political apathy.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Delamont, Sara</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The title of this article comes from the editorial written for this journal by Olive Banks, Len Barton, Roger Dale, David Hargreaves, Roland Meighan, Ivan Reid and Graham Vulliamy (Banks et al. 1980, 4) that appeared in its first issue, and set out its remit. The seven scholars who wrote that editorial pledged to &amp;quot;publish high quality work of any theoretical orientation.&amp;quot; Three major themes are addressed in this paper: Olive Banks's contribution to sociology of education up to 1973; the fate of her work after 1973; and her work as a case study of the troubled relationship between sociology of education and sociology itself. Two important works by Olive Banks form the core of the paper. Banks and Finlayson (1973) &amp;quot;Success and Failure in the Secondary School,&amp;quot; and her textbook &amp;quot;The Sociology of Education&amp;quot; (Banks 1968, 1971, 1976). Banks (1955) Parity and Prestige in English Secondary Education is the subject of another paper in this volume (Edwards, 2008, this issue): a recognition that it is her most important work. Before focusing on the three themes used to structure the paper, there is a brief contextual section.</str>

    <str name="description">Olive Banks' study of the sharp contrasts of &amp;quot;parity and prestige&amp;quot; in English secondary education was published when sociological study of education was only beginning in Britain. It fitted neatly into that study's preoccupation with the interactions of social class, educational opportunity and social mobility. This paper is not an updating of her analysis, but an application of her perspective to some later manifestations of those interactions. It considers in particular the continuing market value of traditional academic schooling, the continued segregation of educational routes, and the &amp;quot;waste&amp;quot; of ability through &amp;quot;modernized&amp;quot; forms of social selection.</str>

      <str>Martin, Jane</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The understanding of feminist pasts has been largely ignored in the history of education. This paper suggests that the historical sociology of Olive Banks provides fresh starting points for future research exploring the relationship between the history of social and political movements and a reassessment of contemporary and historical forms of &amp;quot;radical education&amp;quot;. The article proceeds to use group biography to explore a municipal socialism that has been over-ridden in historical memory by the classic political histories that take the view from Westminster and Whitehall. In so doing it seeks to show the contribution of six educator activists who were participants in the making of a metropolitan political elite emerging from the association between feminism, socialism and the labour and trade union movement.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Purvis, June</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This Appreciation of Olive Banks (1923-2006) draws upon her memoir published in Women's History Review, Vol. 8, No. 3, 1999, pp. 401-410, and upon the author's recollections of and correspondence with her. Born into a solidly working-class family, Olive Banks overcame the disadvantages of her social class background and gender to become an internationally recognised Professor of Sociology, well known for her contribution to the developing field of the sociology of education and especially for her pioneering work on the history of feminism. Her contribution to women's history was important at a time when the discipline was developing as an academic field of study in higher education in the 1980s in the USA and Britain.

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper considers Olive Banks' work on charting the history and development of British feminism, and particularly her use of collective biography as a research and analytic tool. It is argued that while this has been seen as the least &amp;quot;fashionable&amp;quot; aspect of her work, it took forward C. Wright Mills' contention for one definition of sociology as the interaction between biography and history, and predated by a decade or so similar work on prosopography by Bourdieu from the 1990s onwards. More recently other sociologists and educationists have taken up this methodological approach, including Jane Martin and Bronwyn Davies and Susanne Gannon. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    <str name="description">Olive Banks' work Parity and Prestige in English Secondary Education made a major and distinctive contribution to the literature on the historical development of secondary education. Her work exemplified a close relationship between sociology and history, examined a vital and enduring theme that continues to be relevant and pervasive, helped to demonstrate the social dimensions of the determinants of secondary education, and raised a significant set of issues in relation to the role of the interconnections between education and occupational groups.</str>

    <str name="description">At a time when the public sector and state education (in the United Kingdom) is under threat from the encroaching marketisation policy and private finance initiatives, our research reveals white middle-class parents who in spite of having the financial opportunity to turn their backs on the state system are choosing to assert their commitment to the urban state-run comprehensive school. Our analysis examines the processes of &amp;quot;thinking and acting otherwise&amp;quot;, and demonstrates the nature of the commitment the parents make to the local comprehensive school. However, it also shows the parents' perceptions of the risk involved and their anxieties that these give rise to. The middle-class parents are thus caught in a web of moral ambiguity, dilemmas and ambivalence, trying to perform &amp;quot;the good/ethical self&amp;quot; while ensuring the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; for their children.

    <str name="title">A Critical Review of Some Recent Developments in Quantitative Research on Gender and Achievement in the United Kingdom</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Connolly, Paul</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Over recent years the findings of a number of quantitative research studies have been published in the UK on gender and achievement. Much of this work has emanated from Stephen Gorard and his colleagues and has not only been highly critical of existing approaches to handling quantitative data but has also suggested a number of alternative and, what they claim to be, more valid ways of measuring differential patterns of achievement and underachievement between groups. This article shows how much of this work has been based upon rather under-developed measures of achievement and underachievement that tend, in turn, to generate a number of misleading findings that have questionable implications for practice. It will be argued that this body of work provides a useful case study in the problems of quantitative research that fails to engage adequately with the substantive theoretical and empirical literature and considers some of the implications of this for future research in this area.

    <str name="description">Previous research highlights the continuing relevance of family culture in explaining educational inequalities in Turkey, especially patriarchal beliefs and practices that discourage investment in the education of girls. We extend that research by introducing two much-debated, but empirically untested, aspects of family culture--parental religiosity and headscarf preferences. An analysis of a nationally representative sample of 15-19 year olds in 1988 shows that while religiosity had no significant effect on educational attainment, children who lived in families whose fathers expected them to wear a headscarf in public had lower educational attainment, especially girls. The large negative headscarf effect suggests that the government ban on headscarves in schools may be an obstacle to eliminating gender inequality in education. The results are discussed in light of recent trends in Turkish society. (Contains 3 tables, 1 figure and 5 notes.)</str>

    <str name="title">A Re-Consideration of Rates of &amp;quot;Social Mobility&amp;quot; in Britain: Or Why Research Impact is Not Always a Good Thing</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Gorard, Stephen</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper re-considers some of the evidence for low and declining social mobility in Britain, showing that one study based on a re-analysis of cohort figures appears to have had an impact on policy-makers out of all proportion to its scale and rigor. The study claimed to show that the income of parents and children were more closely related for sons born in 1970 than in 1958, and that therefore social mobility was declining. It also claimed to show that the incomes of fathers and sons were more closely related in Britain than in countries such as Norway. However, a reconsideration of the same results in this paper leads to very different conclusions. This example is considered in detail here to illustrate the point that it is not always a good thing for research to have influence. The most important and ethical challenge facing social research in education is to improve its quality rather than its impact. (Contains 1 table.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Rowland, Stephen</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The author expresses concern that love of knowledge, which he views as the most valuable resource in universities, is not taken seriously by the academic press. This article considers what is to be done about it; and discusses how collegiality, based upon a celebration of intellectual love, might restore, or create, integrity within the academic community. Noting that employers consider passion, integrity, enthusiasm, openness and scholarly values to be important outcomes of higher education, Rowland avers that such terms imply love of knowledge, and argues that without the opportunity to express their shared love of knowledge, academic staff are likely to feel isolated from their community, which they experience as fragmented, unsupportive, and non-collaborative; and that the collegium and collegiality may become indistinguishable from the corporation and corporate identity.</str>

    <str name="title">Global Field and Global Imagining: Bourdieu and Worldwide Higher Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Marginson, Simon</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper maps the global dimension of higher education and associated research, including the differentiation of national systems and institutions, while reflecting critically on theoretical tools for working this terrain. Arguably the most sustained theorization of higher education is by Bourdieu: the paper explores the relevance and limits of Bourdieu's notions of field of power, agency, positioned and position-taking; drawing on Gramsci's notion of hegemony in explaining the dominant role played by universities from the United States. Noting there is greater ontological openness in global than national educational settings, and that Bourdieu's reading of structure/agency becomes trapped on the structure side, the paper discusses Sen on self-determining identity and Appadurai on global imagining, flows and &amp;quot;scapes.&amp;quot; The dynamics of Bourdieu's competitive field of higher education continue to play out globally, but located within a larger and more disjunctive relational setting, and a setting that is less closed, than he suggests.

    <str name="description">In the recent debate over education reform, Japanese conservative politicians and intellectuals have selectively appropriated a particular crisis-and-success narrative of British education reform to de-territorialize contentious policy changes. They assert that Britain achieved successful education reform by transforming the very same teaching practices and legal framework that currently afflict Japanese education. In so doing, the Japanese conservatives have legitimized the fundamental &amp;quot;reform&amp;quot; of post-war Japanese education through the combination of nationalistic and quasi-market interventions in education. Drawing on a wide range of literature (literature on educational borrowing, postcolonial studies, and cultural studies), this article illuminates how the Japanese conservatives have appropriated external references to &amp;quot;British education reform&amp;quot; to reconstitute the people's common sense about the current state and the future course of Japanese education. In addition, we use this Japanese case study to advance the re-conceptualization of the politics of educational borrowing from the perspective of non-western &amp;quot;others.&amp;quot; (Contains 2 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">At a time when &amp;quot;personal development planning&amp;quot; is being rolled out across the UK higher education sector, this paper explores young adults' inclinations to plan for the future in relation to work, relationships and other aspects of life. Although Giddens has emphasised the prevalence of strategic life planning (or the &amp;quot;colonisation of the future&amp;quot;) in all strata of contemporary society, du Bois Reymond has argued that there are important differences by social class, with young people from more privileged backgrounds more likely than their peers to engage in such life-planning activities. This paper draws on interviews with 90 young adults (in their mid-20s) to question some of these assumptions about relationships between social location and propensity to plan for the future. It shows how, within this sample at least, there was a strong association between having had a privileged &amp;quot;learning career&amp;quot; (such as attending a high-status university and identifying as an &amp;quot;academic high flier&amp;quot;) and a &amp;quot;disinclination&amp;quot; to form detailed plans for the future. In part, this appeared to be related to a strong sense of ontological security and the confidence to resist what Giddens terms &amp;quot;an increasingly dominant temporal outlook.&amp;quot; (Contains 2 tables.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Tomlinson, Michael</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The UK Government is calling upon higher education students to see their learning as an investment that will give them direct benefits in the labour market. At the same time, the relationship between educational credentials and their returns in labour market has been changing in recent times. Based on a qualitative study with 53 final-year undergraduate students in a pre-1992 university, this article examines the way higher education students understand the role of their educational credentials in relation to their future employability. It shows that students perceive their academic qualifications as having a declining role in shaping their employment outcomes in what is perceived to be a congested and competitive graduate labour market. While academic credentials are still seen as a significant dimension of their employability, students increasingly see the need to add value to them in order to gain an advantage in the labour market.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Hoadley, Ursula</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article addresses an enduring concern in the sociology of education: how social class differences are reproduced through schooling. In particular it focuses on the functioning of pedagogy in this regard. The article presents a model that elucidates the inner logic of pedagogy in order to reveal the structuring of inequality with respect to different groups of students. Theoretical concepts are drawn from the work of Bernstein, Dowling (1998) and Pedro (1981). An analysis considering the relay of social class differences, what is relayed, and its organizational form is undertaken with respect to working class and middle class children learning literacy in a sample of South African primary schools.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>McLean, Scott</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article presents a concise, historical overview of university extension and continuing education in western Canada. It argues that, over the course of the twentieth century, the major universities in western Canada made three basic claims regarding the purposes of their extension and continuing education units. Prior to 1940, universities claimed that such units extended the resources of the university for the benefit of citizens not enrolled as full-time students. In the 1940s and 1950s, universities claimed that such units fostered social and economic progress. Since the 1960s, universities have claimed that such units existed to meet the lifelong learning needs of individuals. This article argues that the evolution of such claims reflected ideological and political-economic developments, such as the rise of wage labour as the primary means of making a living in the region.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Funnell, Robert</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">An explanation is presented about what keeps young men in isolated rural areas. The purpose is to contribute a concrete analysis of habitus as used in educational research. Inadequacies in application of the term are demonstrated in research conducted on school and work by the author in a rural town. An analysis of changes from labour-intensive work on grazing properties and practices of kangaroo and pig hunting are linked to a form of capital to demonstrate proof of a man's ability as a good worker. A form of &amp;quot;rural habitus&amp;quot; is illustrated in an interview with a young man about to enter the workforce. It is argued that dispositions to working on rural properties and in the bush have become enduring forms of capital. They are resistant to school capital and the means through which young men prove their worth as adults in changing rural labour markets. (Contains 5 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Faas, Daniel</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article investigates how 15-year-old white and Turkish students in two Inner London comprehensive schools, one in a predominantly working-class area (Millroad School) and the other in a more middle-class environment (Darwin School), construct their identities. Drawing on mainly qualitative data from documentary sources, focus groups and semi-structured interviews, the work points to a range of factors affecting identity formation processes, such as macro-political approaches and school dynamics. The research found that at Millroad School, which celebrated diversity and where students' conflict was ethnic or racial, young people found safety in their national(istic) identities. In contrast, at Darwin where there was only low-level ethnic conflict, young people developed hybrid ethno-national identities. This article raises important questions about how to create community cohesion in conflictual environments so as to promote both diversity and solidarity. (Contains 1 table and 4 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">This paper focuses on the operation of heteronormativity in online and face-to-face dialogues about sexualities and schooling, and seeks to tease out the means through which this operation is enacted. The data arise from two linked research projects focusing on participants' perceptions and concerns about addressing issues related to sexual orientation in school contexts. Analysis of data from both sources showed that participants' narratives were embedded (often without the participants' recognition) in the heteronormative, through the inscription and reinscription of specific identity categories that fixed heterosexuality as the normative centre. Revisiting these data as a whole, we draw upon Youdell's notion of &amp;quot;wounds and reinscrptions&amp;quot; and Bakhtin's notion of carnivalistic inversion to explore the virtual impossibility of imagining the homonormative. From this exercise we derive important lessons for ourselves as educators and researchers about how offering new imaginaries might enhance the possibilities for social justice and social change.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Mills, Carmen</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article is concerned with the theoretical constructs of Bourdieu and their contribution to understanding the reproduction of social and cultural inequalities in schooling. While Bourdieu has been criticised for his reproductive emphasis, this article proposes that there is transformative potential in his theoretical constructs and that these suggest possibilities for schools and teachers to improve the educational outcomes of marginalised students. The article draws together three areas of contribution to this theme of transformation; beginning by characterising habitus as constituted by reproductive and transformative traits and considering the possibilities for the restructuring of students' habitus. This is followed by a discussion of cultural capital and the way that teachers can draw upon a variety of cultural capitals to act as agents of transformation rather than reproduction. The article concludes by considering the necessity of a transformation of the field to improve the educational outcomes of marginalised students.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores the salience of sport in the lives of eight-year-old and nine-year-old South African primary school boys. Drawing on ethnographic and interview data, I argue that young boys' developing relationship with sport is inscribed within particular gendered, raced and classed discourses in South Africa. Throughout the paper I show differences and durability of meanings across the social sites that affect and position blacks, white, boys and girls. It is argued that young boys' early association with sport is centrally about identity and doing sport, or at least establishing interest in sport is one important way in claiming to be a real boy. The findings have implications for the call by the South African Government to get the nation to play. (Contains 7 notes.)</str>

    <str name="title">From Savage to Citizen: Education, Colonialism and Idiocy</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Simpson, Murray K.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In constructing a framework for the participation and inclusion in political life of subjects, the Enlightenment also produced a series of systematic exclusions for those who did not qualify: including &amp;quot;idiots&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;primitive races&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Idiocy&amp;quot; emerged as part of wider strategies of governance in Europe and its colonies. This opened up the possibility for pedagogy to become a key technology for the transformation of the savage, uncivilised Other into the citizen. This paper explores the transformative role of pedagogy in relation to colonial discourse, the narrative of the wild boy of Aveyron--a feral child captured in France in 1800--and the formation of a medico-pedagogical discourse on idiocy in the nineteenth century. In doing so, the paper shows how learning disability continues to be influenced by same emphasis on competence for citizenship, a legacy of the colonial attitude. (Contains 1 figure.)</str>

    <str name="description">Professions are occupational arrangements for dealing with human problems. Professional "people work" requires a certain interactive closeness; face-to-face communication is prominent in professional-client relations. This also seems the case in the educational system. But in education, organization provides the "raison d'etre" of this profession. This organizational infrastructure enables and delimits educational interaction. The school bureaucracy is criticized by the profession; the profession has an outspoken interest in reforming its organizational infrastructure again, again and again. This article provides a theoretical analysis of teaching, which elucidates this relation between profession, organization and work. (Contains 6 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Allen, Louisa</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Despite policy provision enabling sexuality education to address more than disease and pregnancy prevention, this focus continues to permeate many school programmes. This paper problematises the danger prevention emphasis in sexuality education, examines school's investment in it and asks how useful it is. The ways this kind of sexuality education may inhibit the reduction of &amp;quot;negative&amp;quot; sexual outcomes and fail to support young people's sexual well-being is explored. Suggesting sexuality education might be conceptualisxed without this danger prevention emphasis necessitates an exploration of what might replace it. Foucault's work around an ethics of pleasure is drawn on as one example of how the objectives of sexuality education might be re-envisaged.</str>

    <str name="description">This article reports findings from an ethnographic study of the arts curriculum and pedagogy in a British primary school. The policy context for the study is the school's involvement in promoting creative partnerships between teachers and artists. The pedagogies of three different artist-led projects are analysed, using a Bernsteinian framework, and are characterised in relation to notions of &amp;quot;competence&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;performance&amp;quot; pedagogies. These characterisations are then used to consider the impact of the artists' pedagogies on teachers in the school, and the extent to which the different pedagogies promote inclusion. Broad conclusions are drawn about the relative difficulty of adopting competence pedagogies in the current educational culture of British schools; more specific conclusions are drawn about the importance of time, text, discourse and interpretation in arts pedagogies.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Goode, Jackie</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">There is in higher education a powerful discourse of &amp;quot;independent learning&amp;quot;. While there may be pedagogical rationales to support the desirability of increased independence at the tertiary stage, it may also serve other institutional agendas, such as functioning as a way for academic staff to &amp;quot;manage&amp;quot; the frustrations experienced as teachers as a result of pressures to prioritise research. However, the individualisation of learning constituted by this discourse under-emphasises the collaborative nature of learning. Academic success and failure are neither the property of the individual students nor of the instruction they receive, but lie rather in the relationships between students and the practices in which they and their teachers engage during the course of their ongoing interactions. The learning experiences of international doctoral students are used here to illustrate ways in which discourses of dependence and independence can operate to disempower students.</str>

    <str name="title">&amp;quot;Performing&amp;quot; Racism: Engaging Young Supporters of the Far Right in England</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Cockburn, Tom</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores issues of the racial identities of young male supporters of the political far right in the North of England. Sociological identity theories are utilised in combination with ethnographic and retrospective interview data to inform the failures of anti-racist education programmes. These failures include a naive assumption that knowledge of and contact between racial groups will automatically reduce racism. They have also failed because of the ostracism of those very individuals the programmes are designed to engage with. The article argues that programmes must take as their starting point an acceptance of the fluid nature of racism and the necessity to maintain dialogue in a respectful manner with all concerned, even with those who espouse racist views. It is necessary for educators to offer trust and empathy to all young people before mutual recognition and understanding of all racial identities can be achieved. (Contains 1 table and 1 note.)</str>

    <str name="description">In this article, the author presents his views on Mike Cole's and Heather Mendick's comments on his book titled "Education and Society: Issues and Explanations in the Sociology of Education." In his review, Cole stated that the author's critical realism is seen as an advance on Marxism, of which the author is dismissive. The author refutes that nowhere in his book did he present an argument to the effect that critical realism is an advance on Marxism. In addition, Mendick noted in her review that the author has critiqued feminism and post-structuralism. However, the author counterpoints that nowhere in his book did he critique feminism.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Resnik, Julia</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Economic and technological processes of globalization and the increasing migrations of people in the world undermine dominant national identities. One of the main characteristics of our time is the instability of identities and the continuous invention of new/old identities. Traditions and ethnic identities are deconstructed and reconstructed. Immigrants, first, second and also third generation, participate in the dynamic of identity production. It is as part of this global process of identity production that recently founded multicultural schools in Israel have to be understood. The Kedma, Shevach/Mofet and Bialik multicultural schools provide alternative identities to the prevailing national identity: an emancipatory identity to Mizrahi (Oriental) children, a mixed identity to children of immigrants from the Former Soviet Union and a transnational identity to the children of migrant workers. Rather than facilitating integration into the discriminatory hegemonic national identity, these alternative identities provide new empowering options for young immigrants within Israeli society.

    <str name="description">Can an explanation of the origins of social disparities in educational achievement be assisted by a critical examination of Bernstein's sociology? This central question is approached by a consideration of the status of Bernstein's socio-linguistic thesis. The focus is on the nature of the explanations provided. The paper asks: What is the explanatory force of Bernstein's structuralism? What is the relationship between Bernstein's sociological explanations and Vygotskian psychological explanations? What are the effects for pedagogy of cognitive socialization mediated by language-use consistent with Bernstein's theory? The answers to these questions may pose a challenge for sociologists of education engaged with Bernstein's sociology.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Much has changed over recent years with regard to disability and higher education. Until the 1990s, most British universities were virtually inaccessible to disabled students and staff. However, as society move ever further into the twenty-first century there are more disabled students in higher education, more support services for students with particular access needs, and disability is increasingly regarded as a socio/political issue by many social scientists and researchers. At the core of these developments lies the protracted interface between disabled activists and the academy. This review essay examines this relationship and this particular form of knowledge production in order to further the understanding of disability and the struggle for a more inclusive and equitable society.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper focuses on the experiences of British parents who have children identified with &amp;quot;special education needs&amp;quot; within mainstream education. Expectations of mainstream education can have a negative affect on parents when a child is unable to maintain his or her education within a mainstream school. In England and Wales, &amp;quot;inclusion&amp;quot; within mainstream schools is implemented by the current government and promoted as anti-exclusionary. However, current research indicates that actual &amp;quot;inclusion&amp;quot; (the child &amp;quot;experiencing&amp;quot; inclusion as well as being &amp;quot;placed&amp;quot; in a mainstream environment) is not necessarily occurring in practice. As it stands, the conflict is between desires to embrace difference based on a philosophy of &amp;quot;equal rights&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;inclusive&amp;quot; education) and prioritising educational performance, structuring it in such a way that it leaves little room for difference and creativity due to the highly structured testing and examination culture. Qualitative analysis of parents who have children identified with special educational needs indicate that they have hopes and expectations for their children. These hopes and expectations are challenged recurrently.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper focuses on the Australian federal Parliamentary Inquiry into Boys' Education, &amp;quot;Boys: Getting it Right&amp;quot;, which is shown to be an exemplary instance of recuperative masculinity politics. The paper demonstrates how, through a variety of rhetorical strategies, its anti-feminist politics are masked and how the report works with essentialised differences between boys and girls. The argument is demonstrated through a focus on a number of the report's recommendations, including the call for a recasting of current gender policy, the need for creating so-called &amp;quot;boy-friendly&amp;quot; curricula, assessment and pedagogical practices, and for employment of more male teachers. The report draws on populist literature and submissions from the boys' lobby, as well as practice-oriented submissions to the neglect of theoretically oriented and (pro-)feminist work. As such, the significance of the construction of masculinities to boys' attachment to and performances in school is totally neglected, limiting the value of the report's recommendations for improving schooling for both boys and girls.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Changes in participation and achievement patterns mark a turning point for girls in schooling and place female empowerment squarely in the public domain. Using data from a longitudinal study of girls, this paper looks at female empowerment by exploring the relationship between the production of female subjectivity and the processes operating in social spaces. Findings relating to aspirations for girls' future careers are placed within a context of decile school ratings, and from those findings insights are offered about how the rhetoric of &amp;quot;girl power&amp;quot; is lived and spoken into existence in relation to categories of social class. By examining how schooling, family and classed processes weave through hopes and dreams, the intent is to contribute towards a line of discussion about the shaping of female subjectivities.

    <str name="title">Governing Individualized Risk Biographies: New Class Intellectuals and the Problem of Youth At-Risk</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Kelly, Peter</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">An apparent "crisis" of youth at-risk is a key marker in contemporary debates about young people among a range of intellectuals, social commentators and experts in various domains and centres of expertise. Drawing on aspects of the reflexive modernization, governmentality and feminist literatures, this paper explores how risk discourses emerge as a means for rendering reality knowable--a technique that facilitates the management of individual biographies in institutionally structured risk environments. In this context there is intellectual work to be done in the social sciences that takes as its object the possibilities and limits of institutionalized intellectual abstraction for problematizing youth via rationalities of risk--and the limits of these rationalities for providing resources for governing our thoughts, actions and dispositions--our freedom.</str>

    <str name="title">Institutionally Incorporated, Symbolically Un-Remade: State Reform of Chinese Schools in Postwar Singapore</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Wong, Ting-Hong</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">When Singapore underwent decolonization after World War II, its government--keen on constructing a Singapore-centered identity--sought to replace Chinese schools, which taught a China-centered worldview. This attempt provoked tough resistance from the local Chinese. Succumbing to this pressure, the ruling regime accommodated Chinese schools as part of the state education system. Afterward, the authorities, eager to make sure the now-incorporated Chinese institutions would not unleash symbolic effects detrimental to their position, endeavored to transform the curriculum of Chinese schools into a locally centered one. This attempt, however, failed, because the state was unable to curb influences from non-local pedagogic agents and, without a strong indigenous intellectual tradition, the Singapore authorities found it difficult to produce a genuinely local curriculum. This historical case suggests that we should consider the incorporation and remaking of subordinated culture as two distinct processes of hegemonic strategies necessitating analytical distinction. It also urges us to differentiate conceptually the institutional and symbolic dimensions of culture when using a theory of hegemony to examine education and power.

    <str name="title">Strategic Encounters: Choosing School Subcultures that Facilitate Imagined Futures</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Tsolidis, Georgina</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In the Australian state of Victoria, students from elite independent and Catholic schools dominate entry into elite universities. Nonetheless, there are a small number of schools within the government sector whose students succeed in these terms. Such schools are considered highly academic and entry is very difficult. This paper is based on initial findings from an ethnographic study of one such school. Interview material is used to explore how students understand their school culture, their place within it and its role in facilitating their aspirations. Various student subcultures are introduced, to shed light on how these may facilitate success. It is argued that successful students understand but remain sceptical about the uncomplicated definitions of success and the narrowing forms of schooling that both create and respond to such definitions. Within the context of marketisation, a Government school that creates an academic niche for itself, has little flexibility and, because of this, students learn valuable lessons about strategic choices, including those related to which subcultures facilitate or hinder their aspirations.</str>

    <str name="description">Pupils of White and Black Caribbean descent make up the largest category of mixed heritage pupils in the United Kingdom. As a group they are at risk of underachieving and are proportionally over-represented in school exclusions. Yet little is known to date about the barriers to their achievement. The common-sense explanation for their underachievement is often in relation to the perception that mixed-heritage people are more likely to have &amp;quot;identity problems&amp;quot; and low self-esteem because of their mixed backgrounds. In some cases, this view is further compounded by low teacher expectations associated with the socio-economic background and household structure of some mixed heritage pupils. By drawing on qualitative data from recent research,1 this article will explore the barriers to achievement faced by White/Black Caribbean pupils in English schools. We argue that although White/Black Caribbean pupils are likely to experience a similar set of barriers to achievement as Black Caribbean pupils, there are important distinctions to be made. The specific barriers to achievement identified for White/Black Caribbean pupils derive from socioeconomic disadvantage, low teacher expectation linked to misunderstandings of mixed heritage identities and backgrounds, and the behavioural issues and attitudes towards achievement linked to peer group pressures.

    <str name="description">In this article we consider how broad shifts in social relations over the past 30 years have given rise to new social control regimes in US public schools. We argue that the contemporary mechanisms of control engendered by mass incarceration and post-industrialization have re-shaped school discipline. To illustrate contemporary discipline in the "New American School," we discuss the emergence of police officers and technological surveillance in schools. These two strategies of school social control facilitate the link between courts and schools, and expose students to both the salience of crime control in everyday life and to the demands of workers in a post-industrial world. By incorporating  police officers and technological surveillance into the school safety regime, schools shape the experiences of students in ways that reflect modern relationships of dependency, inequality, and instability vis-a-vis the contemporary power dynamics of the post-industrialist labor market and the neoliberal state.

    <str name="description">The year 1998 marked 50 years of doctoral study in New Zealand, and in 1999 I embarked on a history of Ph.D. theses in Education. Influenced by Foucaultian genealogy, this employed a fusion of bibliographic, archival and life-history interview methods. One hundred and eighty-three Education theses were identified and 57 of these graduates interviewed. How has New Zealand's &amp;quot;corpus&amp;quot; of Education Ph.D. thesis production been enabled and constrained by its temporal/spatial location? To address this, I draw on geographical debates on &amp;quot;space&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;place&amp;quot;. The first part contextualises thesis topics, theories and methods in discourses of international scholarship, New Zealand politics and social change. The second part narrates a parallel history of the changing circumstances and sites of thesis production--biographical, domestic and institutional. It integrates students' accounts of thesis work's epistemological, methodological, spatial and technological dimensions to suggest a history of New Zealand doctoral candidates' experience.

    <str name="title">To What Degree Does the Promotion System Reward Faculty Research Productivity?</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Tien, Flora F.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This study explores the research question: Does the promotion system in Taiwan reward faculty research productivity? By conducting event history analyses, I have demonstrated that the simple answer to the question is &amp;quot;yes.&amp;quot; After controlling for the effects of demography, education, institutions and seniority, the discrete-time logit models indicate that the number of research publications predicts the odds of promotion well. Although the promotion system is unquestionably effective in rewarding research productivity for at least some faculty, whether the system is truly universalistic or equitable remains an open question. Female and younger faculty members are clearly disadvantaged in seeking promotion. Future research is recommended to study how particularism operates in the Taiwanese academic community.

    <str name="title">Widening the Gap: Pre-University Gap Years and the &amp;quot;Economy of Experience&amp;quot;</str>
    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Embarking upon a pre-university gap year is an increasingly popular option among British students. Drawing on Brown et al.'s work on positional conflict theory and the increased importance of the &amp;quot;economy of experience&amp;quot;, this paper seeks to explore this growing popularity and argues that the gap year's enhanced profile raises important questions concerning the processes by which certain groups of young people are able to gain advantage over others during a period of educational expansion. Indeed, it is arguably no coincidence that the gap year's popularity has taken off in parallel with this expansion, as the gap year emerges as an important means of &amp;quot;gaining the edge&amp;quot; over other students in the context of increased competition for entry to elite institutions.</str>

    <str name="description">While researchers and concerned adults alike draw attention to relational aggression among girls, how this aggression is associated with girls' agency remains a matter of debate. This paper explores relational aggression among girls designated by their peers as "popular" in order to understand how social power constructs girls' agency as aggression. The authors locate this power, hence girls' agency, in contradictory messages about girlhood that, although ever-present "in girls heads," are typically absent in adult panic about girls' aggression. Within peer culture, power comes from the ability to invoke the unspoken "rules" that police the boundaries of acceptable femininity. The authors thus challenge the notion advanced by Pipher and others that girls' empowerment entails (re)gaining an "authentic voice." In contrast, they suggest that such projects must be informed by an interrogation of how girls are positioned as speaking subjects.</str>

    <str name="description">This research investigated social and academic outcomes from single-sex classrooms in a Tasmanian coeducational government primary school. Interviews, observations and surveys formed the basis of the evidence. Teachers, parents and children reported positive benefits from the class organisation, but these differed according to gender. Staff identified increased confidence and higher self-esteem among girls, whereas boys developed increased motivation and more commitment to schoolwork. Teachers and parents noted that boys' accountability and self-discipline improved. Teachers adopted different strategies from those used with mixed-gender classes and gained higher levels of satisfaction from teaching, attributable to increased children's time &amp;quot;on task&amp;quot;. Paradoxically, standardised school testing indicated no increase in academic achievements. However, there may be an extended lag between establishing changed social relationships and measurable academic outcomes, suggesting that if the new class structure is to achieve its full potential, it should be established early in primary school and continue to adolescence.</str>

    <str name="description">In this study we examined whether the underachievement of boys in language at the end of secondary education is related to school-related attitudes. Data were drawn from the LOSO project, a longitudinal research project in secondary education. The results showed that there were gender differences in language achievement in favour of girls in the lower tracks, but not in the highest track. The underachievement of boys was associated with boys' less positive relationships with teachers, less positive well-being at school and less positive attitude towards schoolwork. Furthermore, the results showed that--in the lower tracks--boys who were the least attentive in the classroom, the least interested in learning tasks and the least motivated towards learning tasks achieved better than expected. Post-hoc analyses revealed that these are the more intelligent boys. Possible explanations of the demotivation of the more intelligent boys in the lower tracks are discussed.</str>

    <str name="title">The Construction of National Identity through Primary School History: The Irish Case</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Tormey, Roland</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Much recent sociological work on education makes reference to gender, sexual, ethnic, local and political &amp;quot;project&amp;quot; identities, yet there remains a need to bring the nation, and the state, back in; to also question the way in which &amp;quot;national&amp;quot; identities are constructed in a context of globalisation and localisation. Through an analysis of Irish primary history curriculum statements from 1971 and 1999, I identify some key features of the state's response to identity construction in a globalised context. They include a focus on pupils becoming skilled in reflexively producing identity, and a focus on a &amp;quot;boundless&amp;quot; globalised identity. These changes are not unproblematic. You will know all too well that Ireland is a country at war with its past--or, at least, with conflicting versions of its several pasts. But we are each of us in a struggle with those... on a much more deeply personal level than we sometimes know.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lawy, Robert</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In this paper I begin by outlining the key characteristics of a view of learning that has been pre-eminent in the past 30 years in the United Kingdom. The focus of this discourse has been less upon understanding the processes and practices of learning as a complex process and more upon improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the curriculum and of teaching to meet taken-for-granted needs. Making use of two case studies, I exemplify a connective approach, as a transaction with the environment, which acknowledges both the contextual and incremental character of knowledge-making, and the interplay between different cultural factors and influences, including discourse and identity, that play-upon learning. This recognises the importance of all the different learning opportunities available to young people while lending support to claims for approaches to both the design of the curriculum and teaching that allow young people to learn in formal and informal contexts.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines recent empirical work on the lived experience of learners in post-compulsory education. The starting point is a brief examination of the socio-economic context of the sector. Despite the sophistication of analyses of learning cultures, a more radical approach is needed. Failure to do so renders these analyses amenable to appropriation by &amp;quot;new labour&amp;quot; modernisers.</str>

    <str name="description">There is a widely recognised national trend for girls to outperform boys at all levels of compulsory schooling. With few exceptions, however, most recent research has reported that, in relation to academic performance at university, men are proportionately over-represented at the First Class level. A number of general hypotheses have been put forward to explain this phenomenon, including those that assume gender-linked differences in cognitive and/or personality traits. A smaller proportion of research has given explanatory primacy to the broad subject area studied. More specifically, it has been alleged that the over-representation of men within the First bracket is largely a function of a &amp;quot;compositional effect&amp;quot; whereby men achieve proportionately more Firsts as there are more of them within the First-rich Sciences. Based upon analysis of 1,707,408 students graduating between 1995 and 2002, this paper seeks to provide the most comprehensive exploration, to date, of this effect. It confirms that a substantial proportion of the &amp;quot;gender gap&amp;quot; can be explained with reference to the male propensity to take degrees in First-rich disciplines.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper argues that the recent debate about plagiarism has taken on aspects of a moral panic, which reflects underlying anxieties about the state of higher education in the United Kingdom. In contrast to the moral absolutism of some commentators, we argue for the significance of posing the phenomenological question of &amp;quot;what is plagiarism in its appearing?&amp;quot; We present a detailed idiographic analysis of two cases taken from a wider study of staff perceptions of plagiarism looking at the multiple meanings of plagiarism in the life-world of individual staff. Our approach does not entail judgemental relativism; rather, it involves a proper recognition of the limitations of rule-bound approaches to complex ethical matters. We argue for a virtues-based approach to plagiarism, which recognises complexity, and for a more measured and collegial debate.</str>

    <str name="description">While economic capital is not synonymous with cultural, social or symbolic capital in either its constitutional or organizational form, it nevertheless remains the more flexible and convertible form of capital. The convertibility of economic capital has particular resonance within &amp;quot;Celtic Tiger&amp;quot; Ireland. The states reluctance to fully endorse an internal market between schools has resulted in middle-class parents using their private wealth to create an educational market in the private sector to help secure the class futures of their children. Using data from recent studies of second-level education in Ireland, and data compiled on the newly emerging &amp;quot;grind&amp;quot; schools (private tuition centres), we outline how the availability of economic capital allows middle-class parents to choose fee-paying schooling or to opt out of the formal school sector entirely to employ market solutions to their class ambitions. The data also show that schools actively collude in the class project to their own survival advantage. (Contains 2 graphs and 5 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Cieslik, Mark</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper reports on the findings of a small qualitative research project that examined the experiences of a group of adult learners attending a basic skills programme in the English Midlands during the late 1990s. It explores patterns of participation on such programmes and illustrates that early life course experiences can shape changing dispositions towards learning and forms of (dis)engagement from formal provision. The concept of reflexivity is used to help describe the differing contributions that structural and agential processes make to this patterning of engagement with learning. Such an approach is posited as a development of the concepts of learning identity and learning career that have recently been used to understand participation in education. (Contains 5 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">New Zealand's rapid emergence as a late-modern, neo-liberal society following 1984 led to a transformation in the institutional infrastructure for youth transitions from school to post-school worlds. Our research focuses on the ways that young people born after 1984 craft identities in transition. We investigate their perspectives on transition in their last year of school, and the processes by which they make choices about post-school destinations. In particular, we examine the extent to which the transitions they negotiate are shaped by the institutional infrastructure for transition established by policy. Expecting some degree of mismatch between the complexities of participants' lives and the linear transition process implicit in policy, we found instead a combination of traditional assumptions (that transition would be a straightforward, linear process) and late-modern assumptions (about the construction of elective biographies through active choice). These combined to produce a particular perception of risk among participants. (Contains 4 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">This article starts from a conceptual clarification of the notions social integration and social cohesion as a prerequisite for the reorientation of citizenship education. Turning away from uncritically reproduced assumptions represented in mainstream "deficiency discourse," the article first focuses on sociological conditions for the rise of active citizenship and its role in the revitalization of the public sphere. Next a number of educational objectives are deduced from competencies needed and learning processes taking place in practices of active citizenship. Finally, the article argues for the adoption of a lifelong learning perspective, relating formal citizenship education to informal and non-formal experiences of active citizenship.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Breier, Mignonne</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Educators of adults are often urged to use the prior personal experience of their students as a pedagogic resource. Students have expectations that their narratives will be heard and valued. Whether this can--or should--be achieved in a particular discipline, in a course with a relatively fixed curriculum and formal assessment, is the issue addressed here. The paper explores programmes in Labour Law at two South African universities, using a systemic network approach to data analysis. The conclusion is that students experience can provide a useful starting point for induction into the more abstract reaches of a field of professional education (in this instance, legal principles and concepts as well as case law). However, this will require conditions that are very difficult to achieve in the current university context. (Contains 2 figures, 4 transcripts, and 1 note.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Nash, Roy</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Although Boudons distinction between primary and secondary effects, and its associated rational action models of inequality of educational opportunity, have been more influential in the field of social stratification and mobility than in the sociology of education, there is good reason to reconsider the theoretical and practical implications of this approach. The investigation brings conceptual analysis and empirical research to bear on Boudons arguments in a manner that may be somewhat unorthodox. The theoretical arguments are developed in the context of a detailed empirical investigation of three transitions--age 10 to O-level, O-level to A-level, and A-level to degree--using the extensive 1970 British Cohort Study. It is concluded that primary and secondary effects should be recognised as methodological rather than theoretical concepts, that the techniques used to identify them are independent of rational action theory and that, contrary to an influential position, the evidence suggests that primary effects are more important than secondary effects in the generation of social disparities in access to education.

    <str name="title">What to Do about Values in Social Research: The Case for Ethical Reflexivity in the Sociology of Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Gewirtz, Sharon</str>
      <str>Cribb, Alan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper is intended as a contribution to the longstanding debate about the best way of handling value judgements in social research. In it we make a case for more "ethical reflexivity" in the sociology of education and argue that a systematic attention to value questions should be viewed as a taken-for-granted component of methodological rigour. We elucidate what we mean by ethical reflexivity, why we think it is important and suggest what it entails in practice. Our arguments are developed through a discussion of, and in contrast to, Martyn Hammersley's analysis of the role of values in social research. The central problematic that the paper addresses is the tension between, on the one hand, the goal of insulating the research process from "value bias" and, on the other hand, the goal of contributing to political and social change through research. We suggest that the reason for the intractability of the problem of values in social research is a persistent failure to recognise that, in practice, these two goals are inseparable. We argue that rigour in research demands that both these goals are taken seriously and we set out some of the challenges involved in trying to combine them. (Contains 12 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Martindale, Nicholas</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">How have public sector austerity and the outsourcing of school provision under the Academies programme affected the state school workforce in England? Existing research claims that teachers are being substituted by cheaper support staff and that schools are becoming increasingly dominated by managers. However, these claims focus on the period before austerity-induced budget cuts and the outsourcing of more than 9,000 schools under the Academies programme. Using nationally comprehensive data sources, analyses reveal that changes under austerity have been drastic, far surpassing those associated with outsourced Academies. Long-term increases in the number of teachers and support staff have gone into reverse, while managerial teams have continued to grow. This research has important implications for our understanding of how marketization and austerity affect state school workforces.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Previous research on historical trends in the UK in social-class and sex inequality in educational attainment and in occupational opportunity is extended well into the present century by means of the UK Household Longitudinal Study, with a particular focus on variation among England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England, Wales and Scotland, class inequality of educational attainment declined during the transition to non-selective secondary schooling and to mass higher education. But the decline also was observed in Northern Ireland, which retained a selective system. The relationship between education and occupational destinations is then investigated for the same period of time. The use of recent data allowed this to be extended to the mature class destination even of the youngest cohort, who had experienced the stable system of comprehensive schools in the 1990s. Inequality of this opportunity also declined, but again with no particular connection to the educational reforms.</str>

    <str name="description">Teachers' agency has recently been vastly studied from a sociocultural perspective, emphasising that teachers' action is shaped by the structures within which teachers work. However, this study provides a different perspective, introducing relational sociology to the research on teachers' agency. Here, agency is seen as embedded in interdependencies and relationships, either personal or impersonal. Finnish newly qualified teachers were interviewed concerning their teacher training and work to explore how they negotiated agency in their narratives. The analysis shows the entanglement of master- and counter-narratives in agency negotiation as the teachers drew on prevailing societal master-narratives and simultaneously provided opposing categories through counter-narratives. The results reveal three aspects of relationships through which the agency was negotiated: &amp;quot;political,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;cultural,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;epistemic.&amp;quot; The study contributes to the understanding of teachers' agency, paying attention to language and the plurality of relationships in agency negotiation and formation.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores the status of girls' education in the schools of rural Balochistan in Pakistan, and examines the dimensions of access, enrolment and retention. In order to explore the complexities of this governmental problem, we will propose the concept of postcolonial Islamic governmentality. Drawing on Foucault's work on the arts of government, with Dean's (2010) writing on illiberal governmentalities, and the work of Salehin (2016) on pious governmentality in Bangladesh, we will suggest that postcolonial Islamic governmentalities emerge at the intersections of the legacies of British colonialism in Pakistan's post-colonial governance; the influence of processes of neo-liberal globalisation in the policies of developing countries by donor countries, development NGOs and the SDGs; and the forms of Islamic governance embedded in the juridical, cultural, social and gender relations of Pakistan as a postcolonial, Islamic state.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores the experiences of twelve children and their parents from diverse minority ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds during their first school year. Drawing on sociological and educational conceptualisations of resilience, findings highlight protective factors for children's resilience at four levels, including family and school strengths in supporting the emotional wellbeing and self-regulation of children. However, with significant variation in children's educational and social/behavioural development the paper argues for a consideration of within school factors in promoting resilience, alongside individual, family and cultural factors as well as a consideration of the age of children starting school. It identifies a need to review school strategies to strengthen children's resilience on starting school within wider calls to decolonialise the curriculum. It also demonstrates the need for schools to build strategies to engage with parents from diverse backgrounds to support the Home Learning Environment.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Charteris, Jennifer</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Post-panopticism is aligned with the Foucauldian conception of power and illustrates its apparatuses and mechanisms, for instance the visibility of bodies under the gaze, the facility to mobilise power relations for political purposes, and the capacity to engage self -technologies where there is self-surveillance and surveillance of others. As a concept, it is a confluence of the disciplinary power of panoptic control and the ubiquitous security mechanism of biopower in action. Post-panopticism in the discipline provides a means to identify areas of lack in teacher and student populations. Post-panoptic surveillance in Australian schools is illustrated in this article around the use of data wall displays. Data walls are a collective mechanism that produces biopower through its alignment with panoptic disciplinary power in schools. These data assemblages are an example of a suite of technologies that profile student performance, mould teaching practices, and shape subjectivities of leaders, teachers, and students.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper evaluates a range of measures commonly used to target and measure the success of efforts to widen access to higher education. We demonstrate empirically that the area-level widening access metrics advocated by England's Office for Students, POLAR and TUNDRA, are unfit for purpose because they yield unacceptably high rates of false positives (individuals identified as socioeconomically disadvantaged when they are not). We argue that these and other demonstrably flawed area-level and school-level metrics should be replaced by officially verified individual-level indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage which yield few false positives, most notably receipt of free school meals. Unless and until this change is made, widen access efforts will be inefficient at best and counterproductive at worst, and associated statistics will give a misleading picture of how much progress is being made on widening access.</str>

      <str>Jones, Alison</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Foucault's view of the body as a detailed text from which can be read a system of power is used to consider some aspects of contemporary teacher work. In particular, this paper considers the impact on primary school teachers of social anxiety about touching children. One effect has been an intensification of self-surveillance by teachers, and increased experience of child-touch and child-proximity as 'uncomfortable'. Paradoxically, teachers' need for visibility so they can be seen as innocent has the effect of constituting teachers as always and already guilty--as potential sexual abusers. This guilt is now enacted in the everyday common sense actions of 'safe' teachers. The argument is developed with reference to teacher union policy texts and interview data from teachers in a range of New Zealand primary schools.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper addresses the issue of how human beings construct themselves as subjects and the parameters within which this is achieved. We question models in which idealism shapes the trajectory of identity formation and consider how identity might be seen alternatively as a somewhat awkward amalgam of identifications with diverse discursive domains. The particular focus is on teachers conducting 'emancipatory' practitioner research and on how the researcher understands his/her interface with the situation he/she is researching. We survey a range of theoretical models as offered by some leading writers, with particular reference to Jacques Lacan, and consider each in relation to how the teacher researcher might be understood. We provide as an example an account of one teacher researcher examining issues of ethnicity and gender in her secondary school French classes.</str>

    <str name="description">The authors explore the Foucauldian concept of self-surveillance in the context of the use of Individual Action Planning (IAP) as a central process of a 1-year teacher training course. Drawing on work that examined whether IAP was experienced by student-teachers as empowerment or control, the article postulates that Action Planning can be seen as a central technique of a system of self-surveillance. The effect of IAPs in creating self-surveillance is investigated empirically, utilizing an original and non-Foucaldian pre-post questionnaire technique, in order to attract the widest possible audience to the idea of self-surveillance as a key process of governance in advanced liberal societies. The findings support the idea that self-surveillance is one of the outcomes of the IAP process, but also finds Foucauldian 'resistances' among the cohort investigated.</str>

    <str name="description">Because access to new technologies is unequally distributed, there has been considerable debate about the growing gap between the so-called information-rich and information-poor. Such concerns have led to high-profile information technology policy initiatives in many countries. In Australia, in an attempt to 'redress the balance between the information rich and poor' by providing 'equal access to the World Wide Web' ( Virtual Communities, 2002 ), the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Virtual Communities (a computer/software distributor) and Primus (an Internet provider) in late 1999 formed an alliance to offer relatively inexpensive computer and Internet access to union members in order to make 'technology affordable for all Australians' ( Virtual Communities, 2002 ). In this paper, we examine four families, one of which had long-term Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) access, and three of which took advantage of the Virtual Communities offer to get home computer and Internet access for the first time. We examine their engagement with ICT and suggest that previously disadvantaged family members are not particularly advantaged by their access to ICT.</str>

    <str name="title">Research with Young Children: The Use of an Affinity Group Approach To Explore the Social Dynamics of Peer Culture</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Keddie, Amanda</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper describes the research approach of a case study ethnography. The study sought to explore the peer group understandings of five male friends aged between six and eight years. In exploring the social dynamics of peer culture, and in particular how these dynamics interacted to define, regulate and maintain particular understandings of masculinity, the study's research approach drew on Mackay's (1993) affinity group method. This method of grouping people of similar interest and engaging them in discussion aims to promote a sense of group cohesion, which encourages the participants to speak with openness about their ideas, interpretations and feelings (Hickey &amp; Fitzclarence, 2000). The intimate and informal context facilitates the identification of shared and contradicting stories, ideas and understandings through clarifications, negotiations and confirmations. Within a description of the study's methodological framework, this paper outlines how this approach was adopted and modified for young children. The affinity group approach is presented as useful in exploring the social dynamics, relevances, complexities and subtleties of peer culture.</str>

    <str name="description">In the 1990s, temporary youth projects became a common approach to handling youth unemployment and the social integration of young people in Sweden. In a longitudinal, qualitative study, 35 unemployed men and women, attending local youth projects in three Swedish municipalities, were followed over a two-year period. The selected contexts represented a wide variety of socio-economic, demographic and geographic characteristics. Central questions concerned the significance of the locality in constructing young people and youth politics, the functions of youth projects for young people, and how youth policy translates in practice. It was concluded that despite striking similarities in project description and organisation, their actual functions differed, both vis-a-vis the individuals and the municipalities involved. The youth projects studied here served as a social distributive apparatus, as a labour market measure, and as a space for leisure and waiting, respectively. Local youth projects tend to stress the responsibilities of a self-governing individual on the one hand, but to reproduce local structures and inequalities on the other. They both realise locally recontextualised national policies and locally formulated policies.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Menchik, Daniel A.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The use of the Internet in the classroom has often been characterized as a practice that disconnects the teacher from traditional forms of externally imposed influence. This paper examines this assertion by mapping the emerging field of cybereducation and considering how endemic knowledge is contextualized by national curricular authorities. The field theories of Pierre Bourdieu and Basil Bernstein are employed in order to demonstrate the relationship between expert discourse and classroom pedagogy, using the National Grid for Learning (NGfL) as a case study. This attempt to capture the dynamics of cybereducation ultimately suggests how this emergent intellectual field's fragmentation and decoupling from State education forces offers policymakers the capacity to influence use. Progress of the UK government in integrating knowledge from an emergent educational field with its incumbent priorities is gauged, demonstrating the way in which national education officials have attempted to constrain potential departures from unregulated, officially mandated curriculum.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Thomas, Alison M.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Since sexual harassment was first named and identified as an obstacle to women's equality in the mid 1970s, concern about both its prevalence and its damaging effects has resulted in the widespread introduction of anti-harassment policies in UK universities, as in other work and educational settings. The study reported here sought to assess the impact of these policies, in the context of criticisms of the effectiveness of universities' implementation of equal opportunities policies more generally. Its findings indicate that key differences in how policies are both conceived and implemented influence the degree of impact they have. In discussing these different approaches to tackling harassment I highlight the significance of adopting a 'proactive', rather than merely 'reactive' strategy and consider the reasons why many universities appear to be resisting doing so.</str>

    <str name="description">Childcare is a condensate of disparate social forces and social processes. It is gendered and classed. It is subject to an excess of policy and political discourse. It is increasingly a focus for commercial exploitation. This is a paper reporting on work in progress in an ESRC funded research project (R000239232) on the choice and provision of pre-school childcare by middle-class (service class) families in two contrasting London locations. Drawing on recent work in class analysis the paper examines the relationships between childcare choice, middle-class fractions and locality. It suggests that on the evidence of the findings to date, there is some evidence of systematic differences between fractions in terms of values, perspectives and preferences for childcare, but a more powerful case for intra-class similarities, particularly when it comes to putting preferences into practice in the 'making up of a middle-class child' through care and education.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Olssen, Mark</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper attempts to develop a more sophisticated notion of multiculturalism in Britain. It starts by examining the philosophical basis of the Crick Report on citizenship education to resolve the theoretical tension between liberal and multicultural approaches to the subject. To achieve this resolution, it compares the Crick Report to the Parekh Report on the Future of Multi Ethnic Britain, published on 11th October 2000. The Parekh report is then used to critique the Crick report and re-theorise the practical imperatives of multicultural citizenship education. I claim that the Crick report, typical of liberal analyses, is suspicious of departure from the presumption of a unified social structure, and represents citizenship education as the imposition of a uniform standard applied to all groups and peoples. On this basis it is claimed that, although the Crick Report's conception of citizenship fails to adequately take account of cultural difference, it need not do so, as there is room within liberal approaches to citizenship education for a recognition of difference. The paper explains how such a resolution can be effected.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper focuses upon relationships barely explored in the sociology of education either in the UK or elsewhere that lie between the practices and processes of formal education and the aetiology (the 'causations') and development of eating disorders, specifically, anorexia nervosa (AN) in young women and girls. In so doing, it also touches on other relationships relatively under explored in the sociology of education, between formal education and 'the middle class'. Our analyses point to the ways in which social trends outside schools relating to 'the body' and health generate and intersect with what we refer to as performance and perfection codes following Bernstein (2000) and Evans and Davies (2004) . These create conditions of school work that, while increasingly difficult for many students, may be deeply damaging to the identities and health of the vulnerable few, especially if they coincide with other problematic features of their lives. Our request, as articulated through the voices of the young people in our study, is for greater understanding of the ways in which formal education and schooling may be implicated in the production of disordered eating and ill-health. Such understanding might better equip teachers and others to help young people, irrespective of their class and cultural background, avoid falling prey to conditions that may damage or even potentially destroy their young lives.</str>

      <str>Gray, Sandra Leaton</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines notions of 'educational time' with particular reference to the work of Basil Bernstein. It focuses closely on the 1967 Plowden report as a particularly appropriate policy case study to demonstrate how different constructions of time can exist within the same document. It then develops educational models originally mapped out by Bernstein, arguing that a full understanding of the areas of consensus and conflict among these models is vital if we are to understand how teaching professionals think about the future. The paper addresses the following questions: How does time affects education? What influence does this have on educational outcomes? How does this relate to public policy initiatives? Assuming a tacit, collective understanding of time and the future can undermine the very policy intentions a government might be seeking to promulgate.</str>

    <str name="description">This study investigated experiences and needs concerning (supporting) children's school career among parents in divorced lone-parent and stepfamilies. Forty custodial parents from a variety of divorced family situations responded to an in-depth interview. The interview data were analysed using qualitative methods. The results show a variety of experiences and needs for support among different families. In general, a respectful attitude from the school, a flexible way of handling the diversity of family situations and teachers' commitment to the psychosocial well-being of the child are essential tools in supporting children and promoting parental involvement and support. It is suggested that these measures be optimally realized within the context of an integrated school policy concerning the relationship with the family.</str>

    <str name="description">While recognition of the need to involve parents in the life of the school grows in public policy, anxiety continues at the intervention of 'the angry parent'. This paper seeks to develop understanding of this communicative action and apply it to a study of parental voice in schools that identified a number of expressions of 'storming'. The paper argues that these occasions were reactions to events in school and the underlying 'performative attitude' of parents in their communications was to seek mutual understanding. The disposition of the school, however, while enabling communicative understanding on some concerns (such as welfare) was less amenable to negotiating agreement on issues it regarded as core professional practice (such as control of the learning and teaching process). Parental cultural capital, nevertheless, could exercise a space of influence.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Exploring memorial ceremonies conducted in Israeli schools over the past decade, this paper discusses the school memorial ceremony as a potential site for struggle over national identities, and schools as the social arena of an encounter between the State and civil society. Analysis of 50 ethnographies (elicited from semi-structured observations) revealed that school memorial ceremonies constitute a diversified interpretative field, which includes both canonic characteristics and elements of innovation and resistance. This ceremonial field is characterized by a tension between expressing 'other voices' of civil society and the process of cooptation into the national collective.</str>

    <str name="description">In this study, the effects of single-sex versus co-educational classes and schools on the progress in language and mathematics of boys and girls at the end of the second year of secondary education are investigated. Data from the Longitudinaal Onderzoek Secundair Onderwijs project are used. Multilevel analyses were carried out on a sample of approximately 4000 pupils, 330 classes (190 single-sex), 180 teachers and 50 schools (20 single-sex). The results indicate that for boys the gender composition of the classes has more impact than the gender composition of the schools, whereas for girls the gender composition of the schools is more important. Boys make more progress for language (and not for mathematics) in co-educational classes even after we have taken into account the selective nature of the classes. Girls, on the other hand, make more progress for mathematics (but not for language) in single-sex than in co-educational schools.</str>

    <str name="title">Global-National-Local Dynamics in Policy Processes: A Case of 'Quality' Policy in Higher Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Vidovich, Lesley</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper moves beyond a conceptualization of globalization as a top-down imposition of policy directions 'from above' to focus on the active two-way dynamics between global, national and local levels of policy processes. Arguably, the particular 'case' examined here of 'quality' policy is especially appropriate as quality policy and golbalization rose to prominence in educational discourses at roughly the same time during the 1990s, suggesting that the two may be intimately interconnected. An analysis of new quality policy in Australian higher education for the 2000s is used as a vehicle to explore the dynamic reciprocity of global-national-local interactions in policy processes as revealed through empirical evidence collected during interviews with members of the national Australian Universities' Quality Agency. The concluding discussion highlights a key meta-level theme of education policy transfer between countries and the potential for global policy convergence.</str>

    <str name="description">Frequent calls for more male teachers are being made in English-speaking countries. Many of these calls are based upon the fact that the teaching profession has become (even more) 'feminized' and the presumption that this has had negative effects for the education of boys. The employment of more male teachers is sometimes suggested as a way to re-masculinize schools so they become more 'boy-friendly' and thus contribute to improving boys' school performance. The focus of this paper is on an Australian education policy document in the state of Queensland that is concerned with the attraction, recruitment and retention of male teachers in the government education system. It considers the failure of this document, as with many of the calls for more male teachers, to take into account complex matters of gender raised by feminism and the sociology of masculinities. The paper then critiques the primary argument given for the need for more male teachers: that is, that male teachers provide boys with much needed role models.</str>

    <str name="title">Bourdieu's Reflexive Sociology and "Spaces of Points of View": Whose Reflexivity, Which Perspective?</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Kenway, Jane</str>
      <str>McLeod, Julie</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper considers Bourdieu's concepts of perspectivism and reflexivity, looking particularly at how he develops arguments about these in his recent work, The Weight of the World (1999) and Pascalian Meditations (2000b). We explicate Bourdieu's distinctive purposes and deployment of these terms and approaches, and discuss how this compares with related methodological and theoretical approaches currently found in social and feminist theory. We begin by considering three main ways in which 'reflexivity' is deployed in current sociological writing, distinguishing between reflexive sociology and a sociology of reflexivity. This is followed by a discussion of the main aspects of Bourdieu's approach to 'reflexive sociology' and its relation to his concepts of social field, perspectivism and spaces of point of view. He argues that we need to interrogate the idea of a single 'perspective' and account especially for the particularity and influence of the 'scholastic' point of view. He characterizes this latter point of view as unaware of its own historicity and as largely concerned with contemplation and with treating ideas primarily as abstractions (Bourdieu, 2000b). Bourdieu's intervention is to argue, as he has throughout his work, for a more reflexive account of one's location and habitus, and for sustained engagement with ideas and social issues as practical problems. Bourdieu exhorts researchers to work with 'multiple perspectives' (Bourdieu et al., 1999 , p. 3), the various competing 'spaces of points of view', without collapsing into subjectivism or relativism. We then consider recent feminist engagements with and critiques of Bourdieu's notion of reflexivity and chart some of the main points of contention regarding its relevance and conceptual potential for theorizing gender identities and transformations in current times. We conclude with a brief outline of how we are working with a reflexive sociological approach in a cross-generational study of young women in difficult circumstances, 'on the margins' of education and work.</str>

    <str name="title">Fields and Institutional Strategy: Bourdieu on the Relationship between Higher Education, Inequality and Society</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Naidoo, Rajani</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper takes as its focus the concept of 'field', which has received relatively less attention than Bourdieu's other concepts such as 'cultural capital' and 'habitus' in the sociology of education. The development of the concept is outlined to present Bourdieu's understanding of higher education as a field consisting of cognitive and structural mechanisms that mediate sociopolitical and economic forces while simultaneously reproducing fundamental principles of social stratification. As an illustration of its widespread application, Bourdieu's framework is applied to develop an analytical understanding of institutional strategies developed by South African universities during a period of political instability. Drawing insights from the South African case study and Bourdieu's empirical research, the article concludes that Bourdieu's theory may be seen to have transcended more simplistic conceptions of universities as closed systems detached from the sociopolitical complex or as mere reflections of external power relations. However, the strict relational nature of Bourdieu's framework and his concept of the 'arbitrary' have placed limits on the extent to which his theory can offer a more in-depth account of the relationship between higher education and society.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Moore, Rob</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper attempts to explicate and locate the concept of 'cultural capital' in terms of Pierre Bourdieu's more general theory of the forms of capital and their transubstantiations. It examines the manner in which the relationship between the economic field, and its relations of inequality and power, and the cultural field involves a process of systematic misrecognition on the basis of which the positions and relations of the cultural field come to be recognized as 'arbitrary'. In these terms, pedagogic action is defined as 'symbolic violence'. It is suggested that the relationship between 'objective probability structures' and cultural fields can be usefully approached through the 'dual aspect' theory of the philosopher, Benedict Spinoza. Finally, a tension is noted between the manner in which educational differences between classes are explained and the manner in which differences within classes are explained.</str>

      <str>Reay, Diane</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The concept of habitus lies at the heart of Bourdieu's theoretical framework. It is a complex concept that takes many shapes and forms in Bourdieu's own writing, even more so in the wider sociological work of other academics. In the first part of this paper I develop an understanding of habitus, based on Bourdieu's many writings on the concept, that recognizes both its permeability and its ability to capture continuity and change. I also map its relationship to Bourdieu's other concepts, in particular field and cultural capital. In the second part of the paper I examine attempts to operationalize habitus in empirical research in education. I critique the contemporary fashion of overlaying research analyses with Bourdieu's concepts, including habitus, rather than making the concepts work in the context of the data and the research settings. In the final part of the paper I draw on a range of research examples that utilize habitus as a research tool to illustrate how habitus can be made to work in educational research.</str>

    <str name="title">The Transcultural Transferability of Bourdieu's Sociology of Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Robbins, Derek</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">As early as 1970, M. S. Archer argued that Bourdieu's sociology of education was the product of the particular conditions of the French educational system within which it was formulated. The same argument was subsequently advanced more generally by Richard Jenkins, who insisted that Bourdieu's sociology of culture, particularly the analysis contained in "La Distinction/Distinction" (Bourdieu, 1979, 1986), was an expression of the peculiarly French emphasis on taste as a basis for social differentiation. Bourdieu was himself interested in the relations between particular and universal explanation in social science, and in many of his later articles he focused specifically on the question of the transferability of his concepts, such as 'cultural capital'. The English Preface to "Homo Academicus" (Bourdieu, 1988) is an explicit discussion of how the analysis presented in the text of French higher education should be read and adopted by English readers, while Practical Reason (Bourdieu, 1994, 1998) contained published lectures in which Bourdieu considered the applicability of "La Distinction" to Japanese society. The purpose of my proposed contribution is to trace the development of Bourdieu's sociology of education in the context of educational policy developments in France during his lifetime and, equally, to trace the ways in which his work has been used in the British context during the period between the first reception of his educational work in the United Kingdom in "Knowledge and Control" (Young, 1971) to the reception of his more polemical political interventions of the 1990s, many of which implicitly invoked earlier educational thinking. The intention is that this discussion should revive interest in the relevance of Bourdieu's work to the British situation by reference to many of the later texts that appeared after the emphasis of the British field of reception had shifted from education to cultural studies. "La noblesse d'etat/State nobility" (Bourdieu, 1989, 1996) and "La misere du monde/The weight of the world" (Bourdieu et al., 1993, 1999) have direct implications for British thinking about education that are different from the implications of the texts of the 1960s, and it is important to disrupt the tendency still to see the importance of Bourdieu's educational work primarily in relation to "Les heritiers/The Inheritors" (Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1964b; 1977) and "La reproduction/Reproduction" (Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1970, 1977). Finally, the discussion will confront the question of transferability and ask whether the comparative conditions in Britain and France between 1960 and 2002 justify the transfer of his analyses and research methods across the cultures in the future beyond his death.</str>

    <str name="description">Bourdieu's social theory offers a way of understanding some of the most important features of the field of educational research, while also providing educational researchers with a rich conceptual apparatus for their practice. This article addresses both of these methodological themes and the connections between them. We begin by outlining some key trends in educational research, mainly in Britain, over recent decades in terms of Bourdieu's Field Theory. Special attention is given to the relative positioning of researchers and the formation of an 'avant-garde'. We refer to the impact of educational policy and attacks on educational research, with attendant effects on the field, and on the formation and legitimacy of knowledge about educational processes. This analysis is followed by an example taken from a contemporary research project in which principles derived from Bourdieu's approach have been adopted in framing methodology. We give particular attention to the terms of the programme in which the project forms a part, and key aspects of it such as 'user engagement'. Both methodological justifications and consequences are discussed, as well as tensions with dominant expectations of research processes and outcomes. Finally, we argue that, following Bourdieu's own public strategies of sociopolitical action, educational research methodology that is radically reflexive has the capacity to found a critically effective discourse with practical consequences.</str>

    <str name="title">Physical Capital and Situated Action: A New Direction for Corporeal Sociology</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Shilling, Chris</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Pierre Bourdieu's writings provide us with a powerful vision of corporeal sociology (an approach towards human relationships and identities that has at its centre the socially shaped embodied subject), and an understanding of the body as a form of physical capital. Despite his protestations to the contrary, however, a reproductionist bias pervades Bourdieu's conception of social action, making it difficult for him to account theoretically for those individuals who deviate from the class trajectories 'assigned' them during their formative years. After exploring the idea of physical capital implicit within Bourdieu's work, this article places this conception of the body on a non-reproductionist footing by developing the pragmatist notion of situated action. This conception of action is then used to illustrate how the relationship between social field and physical capital can result in not only a continuation of habitual action (and an associated accumulation of particular quantities and qualities of physical capital), but in action informed by crisis and revelation (and associated transformations in the individual's relationship with physical capital) that can aid our understanding of the education of bodies.</str>

    <str name="title">Class, Culture and the "Predicaments of Masculine Domination": Encountering Pierre Bourdieu</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Dillabough, Jo-Anne</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper seeks to outline and evaluate Pierre Bourdieu's work as it has appeared most recently in feminist studies and the field of gender and education. In particular, it suggests ways in which Bourdieu's theoretical insights could be seen to more effectively contribute to cutting edge debates in both social theory and feminist thought regarding concepts such as agency, identity and domination. It also argues that a more creative and empirical engagement with the recent work of Bourdieu, alongside an interdisciplinary reading of more recent cultural and social theories of power, would be a fruitful way forward in advancing a feminist sociology of education. In the present historical moment and against the tide of postmodern and post-structuralist feminist accounts, Bourdieu is often read as a determinist who has little to offer contemporary feminist debates or who argues that masculine domination is too tightly woven to social practices of a given field. In short, this paper argues that such a view is not only a misreading of Bourdieu's work on fundamental theoretical grounds, but fails to acknowledge the ways in which his more recent work on masculinity addresses both the cultural and social conditions underlying contemporary forms of symbolic domination. In short, the paper argues that Bourdieu's theory offers an analytical breadth and range beyond the scope of anything that a normative, liberal account of masculine domination could provide. Yet, in drawing from such diversity, Bourdieu's oeuvre is able to resist incomprehensibility. It stands as a highly focused, realistic and generative attempt (McNay, 1999; McLeod, 2004) to chart the problems of subordination, differentiation and hierarchy, and to expose the possibilities, as well as the limits, of gendered self-hood.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines the discourses of morality drawn on by secondary school teachers in England to describe their attitudes to pupils' developing sexual identities. Although teachers recognized their own formative role in the sexual socialization of pupils and identified homophobic attitudes among boys, they were ambivalent about how far they could intervene in homophobic bulling in school. However, they failed even to recognize the widespread misogynistic bullying of girls by boys as a problem. Teachers expressed anxieties about girls' ownership of sexual knowledge and sexual agency while perceiving boys to be sexually immature and less 'responsible'. We explore possible reasons for teachers' neglect of misogynistic bullying and their labelling of girls as sexually precocious. We argue that the discourses shaping teachers' attitudes to sexual morality and sex education were largely embedded in a form of liberal individualism that impeded them from confronting the structurally reproduced relations of gender domination.</str>

    <str name="title">Including Pupils with Special Educational Needs in Secondary School Physical Education: A Sociological Analysis of Teachers' Views</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Smith, Andrew</str>
      <str>Green, Ken</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper explores physical education (PE) teachers' views of the inclusion of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in PE from a figurational sociological perspective. Starting from the premise that teachers' views cannot be adequately explained by studying the concept of inclusion or the teacher in isolation, it is argued that we can only begin to make sense of such views by locating teachers within the figurations of which they are a part and by exploring two particularly salient features of those figurations: namely, teachers' habituses and contexts. In doing so, the paper focuses upon the training teachers receive, the constraints imposed upon them by their colleagues and pupils, and, most importantly, the suitability of the National Curriculum for meeting the needs of pupils with SEN. The paper concludes by highlighting some of the unintended consequences of the inclusion of pupils with SEN in PE.</str>

    <str name="description">In Canada, little attention has been paid to the extent to which job outcomes are the result of the human capital honed in university or of broader social dynamics. Combining the fundamental insights of status attainment and cultural reproduction theories with propositions of the college impact model, the current study examines the effects of cultural, social and human capital on four job outcomes two years after graduation from a Canadian university. Overall, it is found that variables measuring cultural and human capital have independent effects on job outcomes; however, the impact of social capital is minimal. The findings suggest that graduates' job outcomes are connected to broader social dynamics as well as to what they might learn in university.</str>

    <str name="description">Working within a methodological framework that identified four focus groups, high-achieving boys and girls and underachieving boys and girls, this article presents teachers' perceptions of how gender identity is seen to influence achievement levels. Beliefs about gender identity informed the teachers' perceptions in relation to each of the four focus groups, whereby the underachieving boy and the high-achieving girl were seen to conform to gender expectations; the high-achieving boys were seen to challenge gender norms; and the underachieving girl emerges as largely overlooked. The perceived characteristics of the high-achieving girl are presented as describing all girls. There appears to be a tendency to associate boys with underachievement and girls with high achievement.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper is drawn from a recent microhistory of teacher stress, a genealogical inquiry that reveals the debilitating effects of a 'game of truth' called 'economic rationalism' on South Australian teachers during the last two decades of the twentieth century. It explores the everyday stresses of teaching through extracts from the teachers' oral history narratives, contemporary articles from the mass media and relevant policy statements from the period. Informed by the theories of Foucault, Weber, and the Annales, it juxtaposes particular historical discourses about 'stress' with 'regimes of knowledge' that were circulating in the world of education.</str>

    <str name="description">Discusses ways in which the structuring of home-school relations around power leads to particular complexities. Looks at the notion of powerlessness as a way of understanding relationships between schools and parents. Suggests that understanding these relationships can help explain the failure of many attempts to improve parental involvement in schools. (DSK)</str>

    <str name="description">Despite the diversity of entry points into academia, little research exists examining the experiences and impact of precarious employment at different life stages. Drawing on interviews with 19 academics employed casually or on fixed-term contracts in Australian universities, this paper illustrates how precarious employment is experienced at different life and career stages. Using Foucauldian understandings of power and discourse alongside a life-course sociological approach, we explore how parenthood, relationships and life decisions are shaped by precarious employment in the academy. Discourses around academic 'pipelines' and 'early careers' obscure the experiences of those entering academia as a second-career; and those in long-term precarious employment. These employment structures have deep personal, professional and financial impacts. By identifying the intersection between precarious employment and life stages, we argue that an understanding of the effects of precarious employment requires further, urgent attention to support the diverse needs of academics.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper undertakes an intersectional analysis of the ways in which socio-economically elite higher education students in Chile reproduce privilege through everyday practices of whiteness and beauty. Drawing on qualitative data from interviews and observations with 20 privileged students at an elite Chilean university, the paper identifies and discusses the students' ambiguous racial identifications and the racialized, classed and gendered ways in which privilege was enacted through practices of 'beauty' as a 'natural' embodied distinction. We discuss how ideals and practices of beauty were a 'double edged sword' for elite female students, conferring advantage while also denying academic authenticity. We argue that Chilean elite performances of whiteness offer an added layer of complexity to existing literature, problematising and decentring performances of whiteness from white bodies. We conclude by suggesting that an intersectional lens offers a useful way to understand and address the re/production of inequalities in Chilean elite universities.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article offers new insights into our understanding of the formation, textual mediation, and reproduction of perceptions of children's 'school readiness' in kindergarten and its consequences for teachers' assessment of minority-language children's 'readiness'. Building on Danish Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) teachers' accounts of assessing minority-language children's 'lingual readiness', this current research identify key characteristics of 'the standard school-ready child', which functions as an ideological code and shapes replicable understandings of what constitutes 'school readiness' in institutional discourse and assessment materials. This code departs from Danish majority-class culture in its structuring of normalcy and deviance embedded in the language assessment materials issued by the Danish government. By departing from the standard school-ready child in their assessments of minority-language children's school readiness, ECEC teachers unintentionally reproduce and legitimise stratified educational outcomes for native-majority children and children from disadvantaged and low-income immigrant backgrounds.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines the roles of parental social class and cultural capital in inequalities in English school qualifications. The analytical focus is the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE). Integral to Bourdieu's theory of cultural reproduction is the conception that inequalities in cultural capital explain the unequal scholastic achievements of pupils from different social class backgrounds. This paper is a novel investigation using data from &amp;quot;Understanding Society&amp;quot; and linked administrative education records from the National Pupil Database. The central empirical findings do not support the Bourdiuesian position, and there is no evidence that the substantial parental social class inequalities that are observed in school GCSE outcomes can be explained by inequalities in cultural capital. Engagement in reading related activities are mildly influential, but engagement in highbrow cultural activities are not influential. This is an important finding as the concept of cultural capital has become more prominent in Government education policy.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Forsberg, Sara</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper takes an interest in migrant families' educational strategies in the upper-secondary school market in Stockholm. Based on interviews with parents and children in families living in a socially and economically disadvantaged neighbourhood, the analysis shows how conversion of symbolic and economic capital and assets between national-contexts and between generations shapes educational aspirations together with notions of pride, sacrifice, and guilt. What school choice alternatives that are considered viable options depends on the composition of assets and capital within the family, but also differs between family members depending on family dynamics and family members' different social investments in the neighbourhood of residence. The paper argues that migrant biographies are embedded in a gift economy that influences families' educational expectations. Moreover, parents and children identify sociospatial boundaries in the deregulated school market but develop divergent strategies to mitigate disadvantage.</str>

    <str name="description">Following Bourdieu's tradition of examining the reproduction of the class structure, this article seeks to fill gaps in research on the class differentiation and educational situation of Polish communities in the UK. The article treats Polish post-accession migration to the UK as a social laboratory. Such an approach facilitates examination of class attitudes toward the education and educational practices of Polish migrants, whose prior experiences with the Polish educational system came to be re-evaluated in a differing national context. The article explains how Polish communities in the UK develop mechanisms for validating their cultural capital and negotiating migrant institutions and networks. The article argues that such processes are able to reorganize the class differentiations of migrant communities and to recontextualize their 'national capital' (e.g. Catholicism) within the framework of the receiving society's educational system. The article is based on forty-five interviews with Polish parents and teachers in the UK.</str>

    <str name="description">This article problematises the discourse on 'immigrant parents' against the backdrop of a broader transformation of the welfare state in migration societies such as Germany. While studies have shown that post-welfare rationalities play a prominent role in shaping perceptions of what constitutes a 'good parent', little research has been conducted on how these dynamics influence political perceptions related to diversity in school and to 'immigrant parents' in particular. To fill this gap, the article presents results from a discourse analysis of the culturalist framing of 'immigrant parents' -- in interaction with assignments regarding social background and gender -- within the field of education as gleaned from political documents from the post-war period. By exploring developments in political narratives around the school-parent relationship, the study highlights how current educational reforms foster processes of parents' 'exclusionary participation' in schools by emphasising and strengthening individualistic and assimilationist approaches to education.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Jackson, Jen</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Early childhood educators with higher qualifications are more likely to demonstrate quality in their practice; but few studies have explored the underlying factors that contribute to this relationship. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's theory, this article proposes that the relationship arises from social, as well as educational, inequality. Educators with higher qualifications are more likely to have the cultural, social, and economic capital necessary to develop a &amp;quot;habitus&amp;quot; (unthinking disposition to act in certain ways) consistent with the dominant understanding of quality practice. The &amp;quot;doxa&amp;quot; (shared understanding) of quality in the early childhood sector is itself shaped by two institutions through which these forms of capital are transmitted: schools, and middle-class families. Policy efforts to raise educators' qualifications are insufficient to address these deeper inequalities. All educators require opportunities to critically reflect on how their &amp;quot;habitus&amp;quot; shapes their practice, and to shape the &amp;quot;doxa&amp;quot; of the early childhood field.</str>

    <str name="description">The paper argues that the mother's association with the child's schooling and educational needs is not just limited and peculiar to the middle-class families, as the literature suggests, but it is increasingly true of poor and working-class families too. This paper discusses how mothers from a poor neighbourhood in India straddle between household work, paid employment and children's education and how they envisage and support their children's schooling, at times going against the general tide to ensure a better life for their children. Other than highlighting the gendered nature of support for children's education, this paper, also outlines the nature of the differences and distinctions among mothers from a poor neighbourhood in terms of the family social status and educational levels.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Taylor, Alison</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">University students today are preparing for a more precarious future than previous generations, and the global pandemic has exacerbated their sense of insecurity and vulnerability. Drawing on data from a longitudinal study of undergraduate students at a large Canadian university, this paper examines the narratives of working students, before and since the pandemic lockdowns began in early 2020. Narratives focus on students' attempts to handle the diverse rhythms of multiple activities, and how they respond to precariousness in work, family, and academic studies. Findings illustrate intractable tensions within higher education between logics of competition and care, and between access and selectivity. Further, universities, as well as employers, can be seen to contribute to the precarity of students, and to a 'crisis of care' in society more generally. Our analysis suggests the need for a more expansive and generous vision for higher education, which recognizes and supports students in their diversity.</str>

    <str name="description">This article assesses the impact of a two-year long project-based learning program conducted by the National Opera of Paris in a large number of middle schools located in underprivileged areas, aiming at preventing school dropout and tackling educational inequalities by providing disadvantaged students with the opportunity to discover the world of opera. Taking a counterfactual approach (propensity score matching), we measure the impact of participation in the program on final exam and continuous assessment grades. The analysis displays mixed results: a significant and positive impact for the students who participate in the program for its whole duration (two years), at least for continuous assessment scores, but a negative impact for those who leave the program after only one year. The contrast between the effects of full and partial participation in the program suggests that these may be primarily due to a selection effect in favor of the most culturally and socially compliant students, in line with Bourdieu's and Passeron's reproduction theory (1997 [1970]) rather than a mobility effect (DiMaggio, 1982) resulting from the transfer of cultural capital to disadvantaged students.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines how pupils' aspirations towards higher education (HE) are shaped and reinforced in Chile. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's theoretical framework and building on relevant scholarship focussed on HE decision-making and choices, it introduces two dual-headed conceptual tools which allow a grasp of relevant differences between social classes: firstly, &amp;quot;channelling micro-practices&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;pushing micro-practices&amp;quot;; and secondly, &amp;quot;horizons of reference&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;horizons of potentialities.&amp;quot; Through analysing forty-six semi-structured qualitative interviews with pupils from thirteen different secondary schools, this study shows that HE aspirations in the dominant class are experienced as the natural pathway towards university; in the intermediate class, the possibility of HE is taken as a demand of society; while for those in dominated positions, aspirations are rather influenced by uncertainties regarding the future.</str>

    <str name="description">While students of immigrant origin often face difficulties during their school career, their educational aspirations and expectations have been found to be relatively high. Less is known, however, about the aspirations and expectations of students of migrant descent in more recent countries of immigration. Furthermore, occupational expectations have received less attention in the literature. Drawing on data from a nationally representative longitudinal study of Irish children, this paper provides the first investigation of the Irish case by comparing the educational and occupational expectations of Irish teens across five ethnic groups. Additionally, it explores how these expectations might translate into entry into third-level education by linking them to subject level choice in secondary school. The results suggest that expectations and subject level choice may be surprisingly similar across the groups, with no evidence of any substantial differences being found.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Yu, Kaidong</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines the history of the expansion of educational opportunities in the UK, to understand how different generations of ­working-class students managed to access HE. Based on 23 life-story interviews with working-class students, the study highlights how the changing dynamics of the structure of compulsory education and the labour market have shaped working-class students' views of HE. Exploring the changing structure of opportunity, and how this has shaped working-class students' sense of social position, is key to understanding the uneven pattern of working-class pathways to HE across generations. It is evident that different types of secondary school experience and opportunities in the labour market affected working-class pathways to university with the nature of the school environment and employment shaping various expectations. This article concludes that people's understanding of their social position within the educational and occupational opportunity structure leads to variations in ­working-class transitions to university across different generations.</str>

    <str name="description">Research in education has long noted teachers' role in assisting social and ideological reproduction. Separately, scholarship has also investigated the use of extra-curricular activities in equipping disadvantaged students with social and cultural capital, to embark on social mobility. Positioned at the intersection of these two apparently disparate strands, this paper presents a case in which teachers' extra-curricular work is seen to simultaneously enact subtle socio-ideological reproduction, and the facilitation of social mobility attainment. Specifically, the paper draws on a study of how teachers in a lower-status junior college in Singapore prepare their students in applying for prestigious state-sponsored scholarships. Through teachers' extra-curricular work of &amp;quot;allying&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;aligning,&amp;quot; social mobility and social reproduction are simultaneously made possible, yet also exist in some tension. Thus, this paper offers a unique sociological perspective on teachers' extra-curricular work and its significance for broader issues of meritocracy, social mobility, and social reproduction.</str>

    <str name="description">Oxford and Cambridge receive much criticism over the social selectivity of their intake, to which both institutions have responded by admitting more applicants from non-traditional backgrounds. While university-led outreach strategies appear to have made a difference in diversifying their student body, little is known about the role of student-led interventions. This study fills the gap by drawing upon social capital theory to explore how and why student vloggers (StudyTubers) at Oxbridge are sharing their insider knowledge to inform and inspire prospective applicants. Content from nine of the most viewed videos created by three of the most popular Oxbridge StudyTubers were selected for qualitative analysis. Findings revealed that StudyTubers share their content for the purpose of normalising the Oxbridge student experience and encouraging applications from those who might otherwise have self-excluded themselves. Implications for widening access to Oxbridge are identified, and the value of non-traditional outreach for non-traditional students is discussed.</str>

    <str name="description">Starting from insights into the inequalities that stem from the effect students' cultural capital has on their academic achievement, and relatively scarce evidence on whether classroom-level pedagogical interventions could help reduce those inequalities, in this study we aim to explore whether teacher support moderates the relationship between cultural capital and students' reading performance. In addition, we analysed whether the moderation effect is the same across different education systems, or depends on equity between systems. We used data from PISA 2018 to test a simple moderation model with cultural capital as the independent variable, teacher support -- the moderator, and reading performance as the dependent variable. The findings suggest that the correlation between cultural capital and students' reading performance is moderated by teacher support. However, the nature of the moderation effect differs in education systems with the lowest and education systems with the highest correlation between cultural capital and reading performance.</str>

    <str name="description">Parental involvement in education has taken on a new importance in contemporary society as a result of the rise of ideas associated with 'parental determinism', the desire of neoliberal states to shift responsibility for educational outcomes onto families, and the increasing salience of educational qualifications in processes of social ­reproduction. Nevertheless, extant research has indicated that such responsibilities typically fall on mothers rather than fathers. Drawing on a two-wave study, this article explores the experiences of UK families in which fathers had taken on at least equal responsibility for the care of their young children, focussing specifically on whether the 'labour' associated with education was also distributed more equally. It shows that education was a notable area in which inequalities continued to be played out -- because of assumptions about maternal responsibility, but also the active role performed by schools and parent groups in reinforcing traditional gender roles.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Kneppers, Anneke M. A.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Using a comparative case study, this paper explores the pedagogic practices for regulating behaviour in two Norwegian primary school classrooms with social compositions that become increasingly contrasted due to an increasing school segregation. Based on classroom observations and teacher interviews and using Bernstein's concepts of 'framing' and 'classification', the study has found that working-class students are subjected to a more visible pedagogic practice than middle-class students. The different behavioural expectations in the classrooms shape a passive and receptive learner identity in the former case and a more active learner identity in the latter case. Social class assumptions and neoliberal education policy may underlie the formation of these distinct identities. This paper argues that in an education system that advocates equal opportunities for everyone as the most important value, it is crucial to consider whether visible pedagogic practices promoted through evidence-based programmes rather contribute to reproduction of existing social inequality.</str>

    <str name="description">Teachers' evaluations of students do not consider only academic competence, but are imbued with social considerations related to individual teacher and student characteristics, their interactions, and the surrounding context. The aim of this paper is understanding the extent to which teachers grade girls more generously than boys, and which characteristics of teachers and classrooms are likely to reduce this gender grading gap. We use Italian data from INVALSI-SNV, providing information on 10th-grade students linked with their teachers. The analysis relies on grade equation models in multilevel regression analysis, with students as first level, teachers/classrooms as second level, and schools as third level. Results show that, when comparing students who have identical subject-specific competence, teachers are more likely to give higher grades to girls. Furthermore, they demonstrate for the first time that this grading premium favouring girls is systemic, as teacher and classroom characteristics play a negligible role in reducing it.</str>

    <str name="description">In this article, we draw from a recent empirical study to consider how a person's classed trajectory impacts students from different class backgrounds in higher education (HE). Students face rapidly evolving social and academic circumstances and must build reasonable strategies to navigate their trajectory from education to work. In these situational processes, social class becomes emotionally exposed as a durable relational social ordering principle. Affinities with educational and labour market norms provide emotional advantages. To explore the classed nature of accumulated being in Australian HE in the context of widening participation, we examine experiences of access to and participation in HE, and strategies towards entry into the labour market. The movement into, through and out of HE orders and organises classed experience, demonstrating the durability of class in the face of doxic meritocratic choice discourse.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper presents a critical interrogation of the recent drive towards the 'inclusive curriculum' in higher education (HE). Our arguments are grounded in the findings of a systematic scoping review that sought to understand how researchers have, to date, understood, conceptualised and theorised the inclusive curriculum in HE. The findings indicate that many researchers adopted largely 'technicist' understandings of inclusion as learning effectiveness and adapting current provision, seemingly prioritising a neo-liberal outcomes-driven approach to education. Given that universities worldwide are currently championing the use of certain strategies to facilitate an inclusive curriculum, it is questionable on what grounds these strategies are being promoted and what they might be 'doing' within educational spaces. We conclude that the importance of disciplinary context for understanding inclusion is currently under-appreciated, and that conceptualisations of inclusion and the inclusive curriculum mirror broader educational debates as to the very aims and purposes of education.</str>

    <str name="description">This article, based on Basil Bernstein's theoretical framework, aims to contribute to the sociological analysis of the impact of space on the formation of the pedagogical practices of the teachers who teach Arts in Primary education. Data were collected using the research methods of observation and interview on a sample of 20 Art teachers in primary education. The most significant findings of this research revealed that school space impacts and affects the pedagogical practices that they implement. When the Arts are taught in traditional classrooms due to lack of an art room in primary school buildings, the teachers' pedagogical practices are visible and characterized by strong classification and framing. When the Arts are taught in the art rooms and in outdoor spaces the teachers' pedagogical practices are characterized by 'weak' classification and framing and they seem to tend towards the rules of an invisible pedagogical practice.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Zhuang, Tengteng</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Against the backdrop of teaching being downplayed in higher education, this study unravels how the university faculty members' implementation of teaching excellence is influenced by the interplay of objective structural conditionings and subjective internal deliberations, drawing upon Margaret Archer's social realist framework and her distinction between human reflexive modalities. By exploring 21 faculty members from three Chinese universities with different structural constraints and enablements, the study shows that dual modalities are manifest in all faculty members, among which meta-reflexivity applies to everyone. However, autonomous reflexivity and communicative reflexivity play more dominant roles in generating purposeful actions under the same structure. Furthermore, some structural forces are non-negotiable constraints, and people having the same reflexivity modality may act differently under different structural conditionings. The study calls for universities to cater to both structural arrangements and reflexive deliberations to transform constraints into enablements for teaching excellence.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper tells a story of Israeli male high schoolers who spend their adolescent years preparing for service in elite military units in the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). They dream of serving in special units and begin training at 15 or 16 years old. After years of taxing preparations, at the age of 17 they arrive at the grueling military exams. They are at their peak -- potent and energized, motivated, and in the best shape of their lives. Yet most high schoolers return from the examinations psychologically broken. Having imagined their future selves as virile commandos, they return humiliated for cowering during the tough assignments. The paper draws on interviews with 40 adults who failed the exams 10 to 15 years after the event. Using Bourdieu's theory of symbolic violence, it shows that youthful failure at 17 continues to send debilitating messages for years after the event. Those who fail continually tell themselves that they are not worthy, not good enough, that they do not have enough character or strength. Consequently, they abandon possible life trajectories and possible selves. They surrender to the exam, and then remain prisoners of a cultural ethos they have failed to embody.</str>

    <str name="description">This article provides a Bourdieusian analysis of middle-class parents' investment in private schooling and shadow education (tutoring support) in India, thus contributes to the scholarship of class-based educational advantage. It unveils parents' aspirations for their children's education and investigates how these aspirations shape the demand for private education. Bringing into sharp focus the complexity of social privilege, this article discusses how middle-class parents' articulation of their lack of valued cultural capital informs their decision to invest in private schools. However, parents' views on their ineffective involvement in their children's education produce a perceived home disadvantage, which parents compensate for by investing in tutoring services. The article argues that investing in private education -- both in formal educational institutions and tutoring centres -- is a case of 'capital exchange' (transfer of economic capital to secure cultural capital) exercised by privileged social groups to 'purchase' valuable educational resources, thus reproducing their social class position.</str>

    <str name="title">Stigma and Spoiled Identities: Rescripting Career Norms for Precariously Employed Academic Staff</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Robson, James</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Despite the fact that precarious modes of employment have become increasingly common in academic careers, studies have shown that precarious contracts are often hidden and masked within higher education structures. This has important implications for the identities of those on such contracts. This paper uses Goffman's work on stigma, 'spoiled identities', and identity management, and Archer's concepts of morphostasis and morphogenesis as heuristic devices to examine the ways in which precariously employed academic staff experience their work and think about their identities. In doing so, the paper maps out the complex relationship between structure, agency, and identity in precarious academic careers and the ways in which participants reproduced embedded career norms and dominant career scripts through the process of masking the stigma of their precarity.</str>

    <str name="description">The public funding or even toleration of religious minority schools, particularly Muslim faith schools, is controversial in West European countries. Political theorists often posit that parents' right to choose these schools conflicts with the equally or more important societal concerns with child autonomy and civic integration or education to liberal-democratic citizenship. Yet, few empirical studies have addressed the issue and findings are mixed. Using unique survey and administrative data on ninth grade pupils in Danish Muslim schools compared to Muslims in state schools, the study finds no indication of lower levels of civic integration in terms of national belonging, social trust and outgroup prejudice, or liberal democratic orientation, indeed Muslim schools seem to do a little better. Different explanations for this are possible, and the findings may not be generalizable to other national contexts, but they do cast some doubt on present political hostility towards the schools.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Gutiérrez, Gabriel</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Studies regarding school composition have been highly influential in the design of policies. However, methodological and conceptual controversies have hindered the emergence of a consensus on the existence, size, and direction of peer effects. Drawing on four cohorts of Chilean students (n = 620,044), this work analyses the extent to which the socioeconomic and academic classmates' characteristics are associated with student attainment. The findings suggest a positive medium- to low-magnitude effect of increases in the peers' academic performance. At the same time, there are almost no effects associated with changes in the classmates' socioeconomic status. These findings are stable across school types and are not driven by the sorting of students within them. The results are interpreted in the context of a new nationwide reform aiming to foster school integration and taking advantage of peer effects interaction.</str>

    <str name="description">Private schools have long played a crucial role in male elite formation but their importance to women's trajectories is less clear. In this paper, we explore the relationship between girls' private schools and elite recruitment in Britain over the past 120 years -- drawing on the historical database of &amp;quot;Who's Who,&amp;quot; a unique catalogue of the elite. We find that alumni of elite girls schools have been around 20 times more likely than other women to reach elite positions. They are also more likely to follow particular channels of elite recruitment, via the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, private members clubs and elite spouses. Yet such schools have also consistently been less propulsive than their male-only counterparts. We argue this is rooted in the ambivalent aims of girls elite education, where there has been a longstanding tension between promoting academic achievement and upholding traditional processes of gendered social reproduction.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines how the likelihood of pursuing higher education abroad varies with social background and how such possible variations differ across educational fields. We use comprehensive Norwegian population data which allow for examining two dimensions of family background: parents' education level and income. Our analytical sample comprises five cohorts of first-time students aged 19-24 years. We confirm previous findings that students who study abroad come from families with highly educated parents. Additionally, we find that students abroad have wealthier parents. Interestingly, the relationships between the likelihood of studying abroad and family background differ across educational fields. The probability of studying business and administration abroad increases with both parental income and parental education level, whereas it only increases with parental income for fine arts students. For medical students, family background does not correlate with the probability of studying abroad after controlling for grades from upper secondary.</str>

    <str name="description">In the sociology of education, opponents of deficit thinking would be seen as important change agents, potentially inspiring radical policy change aimed at reducing systemic discrimination of specific sociodemographic groups. That is, contestation of deficit thinking can in theory lead to its destruction. In this paper, we argue that contestation can be overruled or downplayed via public discourses. From a discourse-historical approach, we illustrate how contestation was attenuated in the context of ethnicity in Flemish higher education in the period 1985-2020. We show how a variety of discursive processes eventually marginalize anti-deficit narratives in mass media texts, even though these stances were dominant at certain moments. The major contribution of our study is that it highlights important discursive mechanisms underlying the reproduction of deficit thinking in times of contestation.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper explores the first-hand accounts of disablist school violence experienced by young people with dwarfism during their secondary education in the United Kingdom. A narrative, qualitative methodology was utilised, which turned nineteen young people with dwarfism into the storytellers of their schooling experiences. Drawing together a poststructuralist approach to bullying and Critical Disability Studies, it presents and discusses stories of physical, cultural and systemic violence they experienced, as well as their resistance to it. In doing so, it challenges dominant discourses around disability and school violence, including the representation of disabled young people as 'passive victims' of school violence or disability being the trigger of such violence. Finally, it provides a sociological analysis of such violence, shifting the focus from the individualistic blame to the cultural, institutional and systemic underpinnings of such violence and the role of disablism in its perpetuation.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Maire, Quentin</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The internationalisation of educational trajectories has emerged as a new form of cultural capital in education systems. Research suggests that the 'international capital' offered by language enrichment programs has become appropriated primarily by middle- and upper-class families investing in new forms of educational distinction. However, little is known about the appeal of international capital to different class fractions. In this paper, I draw on Bourdieu's theory of class and administrative data on French students and schools to examine the role of international certification in class practices of school choice. The analysis reveals that specific fractions of the upper-middle and upper classes are over-represented in schools offering international certificates. I use the findings to discuss the role of family resources and education system structures in the making of educational strategies. I conclude by highlighting the importance of empirically grounded analyses of the sociological significance and limits of international capital in education.</str>

    <str name="description">This article aims to bring back into circulation Bourdieu's concept of 'refuge school' to analyse transnational migration for higher education, of privileged students who cannot access the most academically selective institutions. Through the case study of Swiss Hospitality Management Schools (SHMS), I investigate the discursive strategy co-produced by individuals and these institutions to valorise an 'unusual' educational choice abroad. Interviews with staff, alumni and students reveal how SHMS are able to appear prestigious by marketing themselves as the best in their area, unique and elitist. I stress that students' discourses of legitimisation differ according to their home country, which reflects the national hierarchies at play in the field of international higher education. While 'western' students emphasise their personality and emotional intelligence as a perfect fit with the hospitality industry to explain their choice, students from Asia present it as a strategy that affords them a second chance at success.</str>

    <str name="description">This article aims at developing an external language of description to investigate the problem of why particular groups of students are systematically not provided access to school mathematical knowledge. Based on Basil Bernstein's conceptualisation of power in classification, we develop a three-dimensional model that operationalises the contextual boundaries, the linguistic features and the structure of knowledge, and their respective relations to power on a not too high level of abstraction. The contribution of this article consists of a systematic connection of classification with the latter two dimensions that abides the generative principles of Bernstein's internal language of description. Finally, we illustrate the analytical potential of the three-dimensional model through a brief discussion of one classroom episode. (Contains 3 figures and 2 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">This article aims to contribute to our understanding of how moral aspects of parents' choices of preschool play a part in the processes of marketisation and privatisation of childcare in Sweden. The paper explores parents' narratives of preschool choice as moral claims of parental identities. The analysed data are based on a study of how parents make sense of their preschool choice during life-story interviews. Our results point out good parenting as having to do with &amp;quot;making distinctions&amp;quot; between what is &amp;quot;good and bad&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;right and wrong&amp;quot; regardless of whether the choices concern preschools or the behaviour of preschool teachers and parents. Culturally available discourses become visible through the making of these distinctions in ways that ultimately point to the subject position of &amp;quot;parents as particular choosers&amp;quot; as related to a prevailing discourse of parental responsibility.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>O'Donoghue, Mary</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores how a small sample of working-class mothers encounters the field of education. In the management of family and their children's schooling, mothers bring to bear and replicate ways of knowing that are embodied, are historical and that offer many-sided insights into profoundly stratified societies. Here I draw on Bourdieu's theory of practice as a heuristic device and focus only on the field while leaving in suspension his other conceptual arsenal. Bourdieu argued that understanding the social space in which interactions occur is pivotal, characterised as it is by &amp;quot;permanent relationships of inequality&amp;quot;. This study shows that mothers bring to the field their embodied history, their habituated practice, and their access to capitals. The women I interviewed know the precariousness of how they occupy the field of schooling, negotiated through a matrix of intersected positionings and classifications that are embodied.

    <str name="description">This article engages with Atkinson's recent criticisms of concepts of collective habitus, such as "institutional" and "familial" habitus, in order to defend their conceptual utility and theoretical coherence. In so doing we promote a flexible understanding of habitus as "both" an individual and a collective concept. By retaining this flexibility (which we argue is in keeping with the spirit of Bourdieuian philosophy) we allow for a consideration of the ways in which the individual habitus relates to the collective. We argue that, through recognition of the complexity of the interrelated habitus of individuals, collective notions go beyond individualist accounts that perceive only the relational aspects of the individual with the social field. Our approach allows us to consider social actors in relation to each other "and" as constitutive of fields rather than as mere individuals plotted in social space. These arguments will be woven through our responses to what Atkinson calls the three fatal flaws of institutional and familial habitus: namely, homogenisation, anthropomorphism, and substantialism.

    <str name="title">Some Further (Orthodox?) Bourdieusian Reflections on the Notions of "Institutional Habitus" and "Family Habitus":  A Reply to Burke, Emmerich, and Ingram</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Atkinson, Will</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article is the author's reply to the Burke, Emmerich, and Ingram response to his critique of the notions of '"institutional habitus" and "family habitus" in the sociology of education. It begins by welcoming the work done by the threesome to distance themselves from some of the clumsier uses of the terms in previous research but then, via a revisiting of the three fatal flaws underscored in the original paper, the author points out that the processes and themes supposedly spotlighted by the new concepts have already been named and conceived by Bourdieu but much more clearly and coherently. Finally, he critiques the threesome's strategy of positioning themselves and their misapprehension of Bourdieu as a gallant heterodoxy compared to the crude and uncritical orthodoxy that his own efforts supposedly represent. The author concludes that  Burke, Emmerich, and Ingram have done little more than outline in an inferior vocabulary, still tangling with prenotions and muddying the waters, the same phenomena that he ?agged. If Burke, Emmerich, and Ingram, and those who wish to continue to use the terms "institutional" or "family habitus," are not to look stubborn or blase in their research, it is now incumbent upon them, the author argues, to make clear why their favoured notions are advances over doxa (school ethos, family spirit, etc.), mystery of ministry, or other existing concepts.

    <str name="description">Literacy is considered to be a public good--one that benefits not only literate people, but also others in society through mechanisms of sharing and mediation. But to what extent do the benefits of literacy extend to socially distant groups? This paper applies the sociological concept of social distance to examine how social stratification impacts on the way that literacy is distributed and &amp;quot;shared&amp;quot; through mediated practice within and across caste-based groups. The paper presents a case study of physical proximity and social distance in Nepal to examine how literacy is shared in a context where inequalities of literacy and schooling are heavily influenced by gender and caste membership. The findings demonstrate that mediation takes place across caste groups, but less extensively than within caste groups. We conclude that assumptions about how literacy operates as a public good needs to be tempered by consideration of the implications of social  distance. (Contains 9 tables and 10 notes.)</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Teachers in classrooms throughout England are facing a shifting demographic in their pupil intake. Where the teaching of children whose first language was not English was once considered an inner-city teachers' role, more recent migration patterns have challenged this preconception. In England in particular, this change sits against an historical backdrop of centralised control of the curriculum for English. This article explores how primary school teachers responded to the arrival of Polish children in county settings following EU accession in 2004. Interviews with a small sample of teachers in schools that had previously been mainly monolingual were coded using Bourdieu's Logic of Practice. Analysis revealed a complex mix of experiences that appeared to rest on assumed pedagogical norms and professionally assimilated external pressures. Discussion centres on the author's interpretation of teachers' ownership of linguistic capital and its relationship to the linguistic field. (Contains 1 table.)</str>

      <str>Moore, Rob</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines from a Social Realist perspective a set of issues in the sociology of education regarding the problem of knowledge. It focuses upon the issue of relativism associated with the constructionist approach that since the time of the New Sociology of Education in the 1970s has constituted in different forms the dominant perspective in the field. It identifies features shared between constructionism and the "positivist" approach with which it contrasts itself. It is argued that these two positions have more in common than is often recognized and draws upon Critical Realism as an alternative to both. Social Realism explores the sociological implications of Critical Realism for education. (Contains 8 notes.)</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Under-representation in UK higher education of students from less privileged social backgrounds is an enduring problem. While there are examples of productive participation, the pattern of collective trajectories of this group differs sharply from that of traditional entrants. The onus falls largely on students to adapt to established practices that remain strongly oriented towards traditional white middle-class populations. Bourdieu's theory of practice informed the analysis of data emerging from a longitudinal case study, and empirical insights are offered into how students with non-traditional academic backgrounds experienced and negotiated the demands of studying in one of the UK's research-intensive universities. A new conceptual framework identifies academic, linguistic, social and professionally-oriented capital as underpinning the logic of practice of this sub-field of higher education, and their influence on the positional tendencies and trajectories of the students operating within it are highlighted.

    <str name="description">This paper illustrates how critical use of Basil Bernstein's theory illuminates the mechanisms by which university knowledge, curriculum and pedagogy both reproduce and interrupt social inequalities. To this end, empirical examples are selected from the findings of the ESRC-funded project &amp;quot;Pedagogic Quality and Inequality in University First Degrees&amp;quot; (RES-062-23-1438, November 2008-January 2012). The project investigated sociology-related social science degrees in four social science departments in universities in different positions in influential UK higher education league tables. A Bernsteinian lens throws fresh light on how university education might contribute to a more egalitarian society. (Contains 1 table and 5 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines the experiences of minority students from two different cultural groups, immigrant children of Pontian background and indigenous minority children of Roma descent, in the Greek-Cypriot educational system. Through a joint re-examination of results from two different qualitative studies, this paper delineates similarities and differences of how life at school is experienced through the eyes of children who are not part of the mainstream, in an effort to gain insight into the nuances of being a minority child in the specific educational system. Comparisons across the two groups of children suggest that although both groups shared a minority status, they nonetheless experienced marginalisation across different dimensions that were linked to their dual multilayered position as both insiders and outsiders. Attention to such complexities enables us to gain deeper understandings of children's lives, as too often the category of &amp;quot;minority child&amp;quot; seems to be treated as a monolithic and homogeneous one.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Devine, Dympna</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper explores the leadership practices of three principals following a period of intensive immigration in Ireland. Drawing on the work of Bourdieu, it conceptualises schools as structured social spaces and of their leadership work as a form of &amp;quot;practising&amp;quot;. This practising is an outcome of the intersection between deeply embedded subjectivities operating in diverse fields of action that shape, constrain and transform each principal's practices. Presenting an analytical model that highlights the circular and capillary-like dimension to such practising, the paper explores how principals' recognition of immigrant children (their recognitive practices) as well as investment in supporting their learning (distributive practices) are shaped by the logics of practice across different fields, as well as by their own evolving habitus and struggle to be authentic in a period of rapid social change. Practising effective leadership in newly multi-ethnic schools must be conceived as layered and multiple but must be underpinned by an ethic of justice, if the minoritised status of &amp;quot;ethnic&amp;quot; others is to be challenged and overcome.

    <str name="description">This paper argues that languages, increasingly marginalised in schools in English-speaking countries, are gaining &amp;quot;elitist&amp;quot; ground as part of the &amp;quot;value-added&amp;quot; marketisation of schools and parents' desire for their children to gain &amp;quot;positional goods&amp;quot; through schooling. In arguing our case, the paper draws on survey and other data derived from second-language immersion programmes in two Queensland secondary schools, where key learning areas such as mathematics and science are taught through the medium of another language. As a corollary, we also argue that some schools--in our case, government schools--are using their immersion programmes as markers of distinction in a period of post-comprehensive schooling and emerging school markets, which includes both government and non-government schools. There is also a global policy context to such programmes in respect of countries such as Spain, China and Germany supporting the teaching of their respective languages in nations around the world.

    <str name="description">In this paper we explore how the &amp;quot;employable&amp;quot; student and &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; future creative worker is prefigured, constructed and experienced through higher education work placements in the creative sector, based on a recent small-scale qualitative study. Drawing on interview data with students, staff and employers, we identify the discourses and practices through which students are produced and produce themselves as neoliberal subjects. We are particularly concerned with &amp;quot;which&amp;quot; students are excluded in this process. We show how normative evaluations of what makes a &amp;quot;successful&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;employable&amp;quot; student and &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; creative worker are implicitly classed, raced and gendered. We argue that work placements operate as a key domain in which inequalities within both higher education and the graduate labour market are (re)produced and sustained. The paper offers some thoughts about how these inequalities might be addressed. (Contains 1 table and 3 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">

    <str name="description">Precarious employment is considered a social determinant impacting the health of workers, families and communities. The Academy is known to utilise non-standard employment contracts, coming under widespread criticism from its social partners for exploitative practices. Whilst there is much research suggesting certain groups (e.g. early career researchers, women) are disproportionately affected, less is known about the impact of precarious employment on staff of colour. Utilising a critical race theory framework, the current study attempts to close this knowledge gap by exploring the experiences of staff of colour. Eighteen participants across 10 universities engaged in focus groups, revealing three key themes: systemic racism, job insecurity and lack of career progression. Whilst results supported existing research, limitations of the current study are discussed. Recommendations for future practice include a call for legislators and policymakers to create clearer definitions and to better standardise rights and benefits across standard and non-standard employment practices.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">The use of zero-hours contracts (ZHCs) has been associated with the transfer of risk away from corporate employers and towards individual employees. In universities increasing numbers of teaching staff are employed on such contracts. Academics from Black and minority ethnic backgrounds (BME) are disproportionately more likely to be employed on ZHCs. This article draws on the accounts of 21 BME academics to explore their personal experiences of ZHCs. The research identified a broad range of inequalities fostered by a lack of collegiality on the part of permanently contracted colleagues that materialized at the local, departmental level. Using the concepts of 'risk', 'risk culture' and 'White &amp;quot;habitus&amp;quot;', this article explores the extent to which race and racism are a feature of collective departmental strategies to manage risk.</str>

    <str name="description">Academic conferences have a central role in shaping career trajectories, reproducing or resisting exclusions and moulding relations in and to academia, thus shaping academic networks. In this paper, we consider how precarious academics subvert and navigate conference spaces, including emerging online forms. Particularly, we explore how academic conferences generate and nurture friendship as an enduring political practice that undermines neoliberal economic, political and social structures. This is contextualised in UK higher education amidst mass job losses, increased precarity and the subsequent breaking of academic bonds. In interviews with academics and our own auto/ethnographical experiences, we explore how friendship emerges in and resists the exclusions of the conference space for precarious researchers. Finally, we explore how the nurture of friendship by precarious scholars at academic conferences promotes collective action to resist neoliberalism within the academy.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper presents a case study of a Spanish university that sheds light on the precarious nature of many academic posts. It looks at how women academics build their careers in the current neoliberal university, which measures scholarly output through the indexing metric. Application of this yardstick renders many academic careers all the more precarious because it fails to take into account women's care commitments. Because the issue is 'hidden', it is one that is hard to remedy. Based on a quantitative and qualitative methodology, the study's empirical data revealed that the neoliberal university discriminates against women by overlooking the care burden they bear. We conclude that needs to base itself on non-androcentric principles in which care is a key component. This would avoid academia penalizing those people who either require or provide care -- especially women.</str>

    <str name="description">The article contributes to the emerging literature on the intersection of academic mobility and precarity by examining the impact of the 2016 Brexit referendum result on the mobility and immobility projects of migrant academics on temporary contracts. We draw on 22 interviews conducted with early-career researchers in the UK and Switzerland. We examine how the Brexit process threatened participants' sense of citizenship and belonging, heightening their sense of vulnerability both as migrants and as temporary workers, sometimes making immobility the only viable option. We show how it made visible hidden hierarchies and fault lines, prompting unequal strategies as researchers struggled to maintain their prerogatives as members of their communities. Passport privilege and the 'good migrant' figure emerged as central to these individualised strategies. The article challenges the framing of academic mobility as a natural and beneficial career move for early-career researchers grappling with the added uncertainties caused by Brexit.</str>

    <str name="title">Career Development or Career Delay? Postdoctoral Fellowships and the De-Professionalizing of Academic Work in South African Universities</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Kerr, Philippa</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper argues that the South African postdoctoral fellow system is de-professionalising academic work by constituting postdocs as students who receive training from the university rather than employees who work for it. Ironically, it obscures this de-professionalisation with a discourse of postdoctoral fellowships as 'professional development' opportunities. This case is made through a critical discourse analysis which contrasts the way universities construct postdoctoral fellowships on their websites with a structural analysis of the functions postdoctoral fellows fulfil within a commodifying higher education system. Postdocs produce research outputs for universities more cheaply than employees, and in a way which makes universities score better on various metrics that only count permanently-employed academics. Considering Fairclough's ideas about the relationship between semiotic and other elements of institutions, the discourse of 'professional development' serves as a delaying and distracting tactic which keeps us from asking whether academic scholars should be supported by stable employment.</str>

    <str name="title">Sexual Misconduct in UK Higher Education and the Precarity of Institutional Knowledge</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Page, Tiffany</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article draws upon the 2020 review commissioned by the University of Strathclyde in the UK into the sexual misconduct of an academic staff member, Kevin O'Gorman, to examine competing and multi-varied forms of precarity in UK higher education. It considers how precarity as a political condition has the ability to shift and attach to different kinds of structures and bodies, including institutions. The case at Strathclyde helps to illustrate how a claim to precarity can be appropriated by an institution, while simultaneously divesting this term of meaning and attachment to human experience. The article builds on this examination of precarity to investigate the precarious status of knowledge in relation to violence. It argues that despite claims to want to know, institutional failure to understand and act on sexual misconduct is a form of wilful ignorance and an exertion of epistemological power that protects the institution.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Wheelahan, Leesa</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper argues that competency-based training in vocational education and training in Australia is one mechanism through which the working class is denied access to powerful knowledge represented by the academic disciplines. The paper presents a modified Bernsteinian analysis to argue that vocational education and training students need access to disciplinary knowledge using Bernstein's argument that abstract, conceptual knowledge is the means societies use to think &amp;quot;the unthinkable&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the not-yet-thought&amp;quot;. I supplement Bernstein's social argument for democratic access to the disciplines with an epistemic argument that draws on the philosophy of critical realism.</str>

    <str name="description">Ofsted, the inspection authority in England, has told schools to ensure that all students have access to cultural capital, taken as a canon of music, literature and art. In this paper, we trouble this guidance by analysing conversations with 1447 senior secondary students. The students reported that the arts offered considerable personal benefits, as well as creative self-expression (visual art) and vocational and networking skills (performing arts). By bringing Bourdieu to the dataset we offer a field analysis that shows how arts cultural capitals might follow the logics of the education field. We speculate that, despite the likelihood that these elite cultural capitals were not of equal value to all students, arts capitals and dispositions might support wider resistances to logics of practice in other fields.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Pratama, Stephen</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Some Indonesian teachers have entangled alternative versions in their teachings on the 1965 affair, a controversial vicious and political event in Indonesia, to counterbalance or even contest the communist coup narrative in the history lesson curriculum and school textbooks. Employing the sociological tools of Margaret Somers, this paper dissects the stories of eleven high school history teachers about what enables them to teach multiple interpretations of the 1965 affair. The inclusion of different accounts in their teachings is navigated by various narratives of the affair that they acquired or fabricated in certain socio-historical and political settings. However, teaching is far from an independent pedagogical action. Accordingly, the extent to which each teacher could easily teach multiple versions was related to surrounding actors inside or outside of the school and their narratives of the 1965 affair and communism, as well as perceived absence of any institutional practice to veto such teachings.</str>

    <str name="description">Growing literatures highlight global shifts in education brought by spreading neoliberal values and marketisation. Parallel literatures address parenting styles. Parents, these literatures observe, are increasingly made responsible and/or voluntarily take responsibility for educational inputs alongside mainstream schooling. Much parental investment is in the so-called shadow education sector of private supplementary tutoring. Examining Chinese patterns, this paper notes longstanding high enrolment rates in both academic and non-academic supplementary education prior to government restrictions that brought a sharp marketplace jolt. The paper then employs parental interview data to show the rationales for such investment despite efforts by the Chinese authorities to retain schooling as a fully-sufficient form of education. The strengthened government policy altered the picture, but it seems likely that in the competitive society many parents will still secure supplementary support to manage what they feel to be a precarious environment.</str>

    <str name="description">Ethnic minority students--often descendants of earlier waves of immigrants from neighbouring South and Southeast Asian countries--have been under-represented in enrolment in higher education in Hong Kong. In addressing low university/college-enrolment, traditionally under-represented students' family and community are considered deficit and under-resourced, and their inherent values and strengths remain unrecognised and less-explored. This study employed the community cultural wealth framework to highlight the various forms of capital existing within the families and communities of 15 South/Southeast Asian university students that had allowed them to navigate university predisposition, search and choice processes. The findings of this study unveil the diversity and richness of capital within non-dominant communities that have limited access to capital, normalised within hegemonic and oppressive educational institutions and call for researchers and educators to legitimise and utilise the community resources for widening university attendance.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper draws upon Foucault's problematisation of &amp;quot;governmentality&amp;quot; analysis to explore teacher interviews from Australian secondary schools, where student voice was 'enacted' within a teacher assessment reform strategy. By bringing teacher voices into relation with theory, it illustrates how the current 'sociality of performativity' is situating student voice-based assessment initiatives as power apparatuses of teacher surveillance that shape teacher-student relationships. The analysis portrays teachers' responses to such 'techniques of power', employing forms of &amp;quot;auditable commodification,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;physical proximity,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;reflective practice&amp;quot; as a means of managing student voice 'risk'. In so doing, the teachers relegated teacher-student relationships to the margins, struggling to profess an ethic of care; paradoxically disadvantaging students through voice initiatives intended to advance them. Demonstrating how affective fundamentals are eclipsed by performative-invested practices, the analysis highlights the discursive policy contestations of rapport and performance that should be taken into consideration in future implementations of student voice-based assessment initiatives.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Walton, Jessica</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper is based on ethnographic research of Australian and South Korean primary school students' experiences of on-line synchronous intercultural exchanges as part of a school partnership. Starting with an embodied understanding of learning, I discuss the applicability of body pedagogies to the on-line context in a classroom setting by analysing how the institutional dimension ('situated epistemic relations') informed how the children were taught to engage during on-line intercultural exchanges in relation to the children's embodied experiences of the exchanges ('practical epistemological analysis'). Through a more holistic approach that includes the body as integral to the students' digitally-mediated interactions, this paper provides a deeper understanding of the students' intercultural learning that is not limited to a cognitive focus on language learning and skill acquisition. I conclude with thoughts on future research directions including how children's embodied experiences of intercultural exchanges may contribute to the longer-term development of an 'intercultural habitus'.</str>

    <str name="description">In highly marketised higher education systems, massification has afforded greater access, particularly for first-in-generation students. Generally, this expansion has been fuelled by neoliberal ideologies that valorise the notion of choice and promise of social mobility. In this study, using interviews with 25 first-generation students, the issue of choice is critically examined in one of the earliest arenas of neoliberal experimentation: the Chilean higher education system. The study found that these first-in-generation students encountered complex and multi-levelled challenges in making higher education choices. Such choices were firmly anchored in differing levels of aspiration, and were strongly mediated by both family and school social capital. As a result, we propose an addition to traditional conceptions of choice: students (and their families) who act as strategic choosers. This outcome challenges the notion that first-in-generation students encounter unitary trajectories or equitable choices in encountering higher education.</str>

    <str name="description">There is a contradiction of intensive national policy efforts and the slow pace of change in widening participation in England. This paper focuses on the use of contextual data in STEM subjects, where there has been less progress in widening access and a more rigid entry pathway through A-level study. Interviews with admissions tutors suggest a narrative in which STEM curricula, and the prior knowledge and skills required to succeed within it are fixed, and that attempts to widen participation and broaden the notion of 'best students' could undermine academic standards and the student experience. The paper draws on social justice and social reproduction theoretical frameworks to explore policy enactment, identifying support for widening participation and the effects of a conservative ethos amongst academics. The tension of these approaches, alongside the autonomy of decision-makers, are key dynamics explaining the inertia of policy efforts for change.</str>

    <str name="description">Teachers are increasingly required to enact assessment policies in digitalised spaces, raising ethical issues of privacy and surveillance in the process. Yet, while &amp;quot;policy enactment&amp;quot; has been examined extensively, there remains research uncertainty around the ethical dimensions associated with assessment policy in digitalised settings. Drawing upon Ball et al.'s Typology of Policy Positions, and utilising Australian teachers' interviews, we illustrate how the policy positions of the latter were shaped by &amp;quot;critical ethical incidents&amp;quot; in digitalised conditions. We describe how teachers struggled to reconcile their ethical obligation to provide valid assessment outcomes with their &amp;quot;duty of care, procedural institutional commitments,&amp;quot; and the need to protect &amp;quot;student privacy.&amp;quot; To ensure 'ethical assessment' practices that best fulfil their obligations, the educators were not confined to one policy position, rather they moved across roles, also framed as moral recuperation mechanisms. Regulations to help facilitate policy enactments of 'ethical assessment' in digitalised contexts are suggested.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Career development theory is critical in understanding how individuals make transitions through education and the workplace. However, despite evidence of the importance of geographical place in shaping individual trajectories, limited theoretical work has focused on the topic. In this paper, the potential for the development of a theoretical framework of career development that explicitly addresses the role of place is explored. This paper starts by outlining the limited ways that place has been conceptualised in existing career development literature, and then explores potential developments utilising the theoretical tools from careership theory and the work of Pierre Bourdieu and integrating insights from contemporary spatial theorists. The paper finishes by drawing together a spatio-relational framework for career development which both encompasses insights from the existing literature and extends this work arguing that place is a salient dimension in career development to a much more significant extent than has been previously recognised.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">External privatisation of public education has emerged in Finland in the admission to higher education. A field analysis of thematic interviews (N = 22) with powerful actors in the private educational market and middle-class young people applying for places at universities in the highly competitive disciplines of medicine and law was conducted. The research task was to examine the discourses that construct the limits of the public and private fields, and the kind of homology that emerges. Four discourses were identified: support, business, social responsibility, and personal responsibility. The private field distinguished itself from the public fields through the discourse of business and attached itself to it through the discourse of support. The dominance of the symbolic power of transformed economic capital in the private field mobilised in the public field was misrecognised during the admission process as 'motivation'. The homology between the two fields was strong yet hidden.</str>

    <str name="description">A considerable body of sociological literature has examined the role that education plays in the ongoing reproduction of class-based inequalities. However, there is a relative lack of research that has focused on the reproduction of inequalities linked to the combined influences of disability and social class. Based on a qualitative study of 19 Australian families, this article examines how the strategies that mothers adopt to advocate for their dyslexic children are shaped by social class. We argue that the expectation by schools that mothers will advocate for their child reproduces inequality because advocacy hinges on mothers having access to specialised cultural capital and considerable financial capital. Our findings also indicate that there is a reliance on mothers to advocate for their child in order to get support. We argue that this reliance on advocacy shifts responsibility for inclusion from the state to mothers, further reproducing a system that is exclusionary of students with disabilities.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Peers may both promote conformity and discourage ambitious choices when students make educational decisions. Low socioeconomic status (SES) students may be more sensitive to outside influence than high SES students when making educational decisions. Considering the case of choosing between an academic track and a vocational track in Danish post-compulsory education, I test whether low SES students are more prone to conform to peer preference or more likely to be deterred from choosing the more ambitious academic track by more ambitious peers. I test these hypotheses using multilevel models with school fixed effects on survey data from 882 Danish 9th-grade students, with information on track choice and survey measures of normative track preference. I find that higher classroom peer preference for the academic track is associated with higher probability of choosing the academic track, especially for low SES students. Thus, ambitious peers may help compensate for inequality in track choice.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Addressing in-service teacher professional development is a significant issue for educational stakeholders as reform movements mobilize to replace teacher-led instruction with student-centred pedagogies. Teachers need access to high-quality professional development to mitigate implementation problems associated with reform practices. Drawing on critical ethnography, I followed the year-long professional journey of six in-service science teachers in Quebec, Canada. Video-recorded professional development meetings and semi-structured interviews captured how teachers worked to enact sophisticated inquiry-based teaching practices. I have used a Bourdieusian lens to examine teachers' shifting habitus as they professionally develop in collaborative professional development. Findings suggested that the field of educational reform is transformative when teachers engage with a professional learning model emphasizing critical reflection and collaborative discourse. Using Bourdieu's concept of habitus and field, findings illustrate the benefits of pedagogic work on teachers' repertoires of practice to understand the generative potential of professional development to transform teachers' instructional practices.</str>

    <str name="description">Although previous studies have investigated the contribution of several components of the school choice paradigm to school segregation, one critical aspect has not received attention from segregation scholars: schools' priority rules, that is, the rules schools apply in case of oversubscription. We evaluate how three priority rules -- grade-based, distance-based, and random-based -- shape school segregation. Using Swedish register data on students' applications to upper secondary education in Stockholm, Sweden, we assess the effect of these priority rules from two counterfactual frameworks. One uses actual students' rank-ordered lists, and the other relies on a large-scale simulation framework. We show that grade-based and distance-based priorities produce higher levels of segregation than random-based priorities through different mechanisms. Our results hold, even when we control for students' school preferences and residential segregation.</str>

    <str name="description">Despite the group of Newly Arrived Migrant Students (NAMS) being very diverse, their educational outcomes are homogeneous and rather weak in many countries. In Flanders (Belgium) the educational trajectory of NAMS starts in a separate program that prepares them for their transition to regular secondary education. Rather than seeing the outcomes of reception education as the result of the behaviour of individual teachers and students, we argue that this problem should be addressed using a field approach that directs attention to the structural relationships between reception education and regular education. We rely on Bourdieu's agency-structure bridging concept of social fields to reveal this relative position and the implicit assumptions or doxa that sustain it. Administrative data on teachers and students in secondary education, as well as policy texts, the transcripts of 37 interviews with teachers and the fieldnotes from the observations of 28 admission councils were analysed.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">As contemporary research explores the social and cultural dynamics of school bullying, notions of space and time provide avenues to unpack youth-centred insights into students' bullying experiences. Furthermore, spatiotemporal analysis demonstrates the links between similar experiences, such as bullying and relationship violence, that are often siloed in research and policy. Yet, within this converging field, there are contradictory accounts, from both young people and researchers, of the school as both a non-violent space and a space filled with unseen violence. In this paper, I argue that this contradiction reveals an essential aspect of young people's experience of bullying in schools. To develop this approach, school bullying is conceptualised in this paper as 'social violence' with a momentum that can linger and become institutionalised in the architecture of schools.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores the ways in which white monolingual and monocultural English teachers articulate racial issues and conceptualise the racial identities of multiply-marginalised students in the classroom context. Drawing on the work of Charles Mills, this contribution aligns with an understanding of white supremacy as a means to historically dispossess, assimilate, and eliminate negatively racialized and language-minoritized communities, through mechanisms of Western settler-colonial hegemony and English language teaching. The authors present a qualitative case study of discursive practices of white English language educators who, despite their intentions to be inclusive, often (re)produce white supremacist values, language, and knowledges. Finally, this paper supports a more critical approach to the field of English language teaching, which recognizes and contends with whiteness and white supremacy in the co-construction of negatively-­racialized and language-minoritized identities.</str>

    <str name="description">This qualitative study explored the university experiences of 13 students from Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller (GRT) communities in England and Scotland. Using conceptual tools, informed by the work of Bourdieu, such as racialised habitus and racialised cultural capital, as well as Elias's work on established-outsider figurations we show that GRT students are 'racialised' outsiders in university established white habitus, with students experiencing the devaluing of their cultural capital including anti-Gypsy and anti-Roma rhetoric within university settings. Moreover, a destabilised habitus was evident, for some, who experienced 'cultural dissonance' between community and university expectations as well as feelings of 'not being good enough'. This was compounded by the racialised controlling images they encountered, resulting in hyper-vigilance about the sharing of their ethnic identity. For some, this led to painfully 'fragmented selves' which was exacerbated by a lack of support from universities and invisibility within institutional established white habitus.</str>

    <str name="description">In this paper, we examine how evolutions related to the fragmentation of labour markets, the flexibilisation of work and employment conditions, and the multiplication of teacher training models and teachers' roles in schools, are contributing to reshaping teachers' careers. Drawing on interviews with teachers and senior leaders from 8 schools in London, our analyses highlight six career patterns and their embeddedness in the changing institutional environment of labour markets for teachers. Our results help renew the dialogue between research on teachers' professional lives and on teachers' labour markets. They have wider implications for knowledge on the fragmentation of the teaching profession, beyond the London case.</str>

    <str name="description">Schools have a duty of care to children that extends beyond educational performance to include wellbeing and welfare. Yet, research has highlighted the tensions that arise when 'care' and 'learning' are treated as binaries, especially when schools operate within unequal socio-­economic conditions. Extended COVID-19 school closures brought these issues into sharp relief, highlighting the central role of schools as a front line service in the lives of poorer children. This paper provides qualitative insights into the classed experiences of extended school closure and the role and response of schools through the eyes of parents, teachers and principals in Ireland. We frame these responses in the context of the provision of a careful education, exploring the role of normative and affective relations in teaching and learning. Questions are posed in relation to schools as care regimes and the 'mission creep' between educational and welfare provision in schools serving poorer children.</str>

    <str name="description">Inequality in students' degree outcomes has been a concern for the higher education sector and the UK government for more than a decade. Since its inception in 2018, the Office for Students in England has prioritised the need for evidence of causality through requiring institutions to evaluate the effectiveness of their initiatives as set out in Access and Participation Plans. This policy development responds to several reports which identify a dearth of evidence-based interventions and scant knowledge of 'what works'. This paper traces the interplay between policy and research, focusing on the assumptions they make about causality. It concludes that unwarranted positions are taken in both spheres of practice, making progress unlikely. A conception of causality situated in extant formal theory on evidential pluralism and that draws on current practices would help us address inequality more effectively. Alternative framings of the problem of inequality in students' degree outcomes is offered.</str>

    <str name="description">The question of professional trust urgently needs closer attention in relation to teacher recruitment and retention, as this research shows it has significant bearing on the symbolic capital that may help to attract, motivate, and sustain high quality teachers. In Australian schools, teachers are frequently subject to initiatives to improve their practice, address their perceived limitations, and hold them accountable for failing students, schools, or systems. We argue that teachers, in the advent of these reforms intended to improve them, come to believe they are distrusted in their professional roles. Denying teachers the sense of themselves as capable professionals risks contributing to the problems of retention that are becoming ever more urgent in the Australian context and elsewhere in the world. This article explores the impacts of discourses and policy directions on teachers' perceptions of professional trust. Drawing on case study data from two schools in the state of Victoria, Australia, we highlight the ways discourses of professional distrust emerge through policy directives that position teachers as 'the problem' in education.</str>

    <str name="title">What Higher Education Ministers Talk about When They Talk about Innovation</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Flavin, Michael</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article analyses speeches made by UK higher education ministers, from the election of the Conservative government in May 2015 through to September 2020. The article uses disruptive innovation as a theoretical framework through which to analyse ministers' perspectives on innovation. The methodology is content analysis with a directed approach. Fourteen speeches are analysed. Innovation is shown to serve an economic agenda, enabling students to transact their higher education quickly and subsequently function without state support. Innovation is also a flexible term offering numerous solutions, from providing economic growth; to militating against the isolationism of Brexit; to providing a route out of the pandemic. Innovation is intended to enhance economic performance and to deliver efficiency, but not to fundamentally disrupt the existing organisation of the UK's higher education sector. Innovation, as articulated by Ministers for Higher Education, comprises sustaining innovation and efficiency innovation, but not disruptive innovation.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Wiltgren, Layal</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article focuses on the discrepancy between school staffs' views of a permissive, inclusive classroom climate, and high-performing minority students' stories of social exclusion. The students are seemingly well-integrated into the Swedish school system, they have good grades, high ambitions, and attend a prestigious school. However, students with migration backgrounds describe recurring experiences of polite exclusion in the form of subtle, often unspoken, distancing from the students termed 'the Swedes', while school staff describe an equal and inclusive class climate, welcoming and accepting of all students. This study is based on participant observation in a prestigious high school, as well as interviews with students and staff.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Applying a Bourdieusian lens, this study seeks to explore the interactions between secondary and higher education and how these interactions impact marginalised students in an elite university in China. It presents accounts of the educational experiences of 13 marginalised students of rural origin. The findings suggest that for them educational institutions function as the main field of inculcating capital and instilling habitus due to their families' powerlessness to engage more deeply. When secondary schools and universities are consistent in terms of doxa, available capital and practices, marginalised students are more likely to undergo 'fish-in-water' experiences in the elite field, and a synergy is also more likely to occur between individual habitus and the field. Otherwise, the conflicts and incompatibility between different educational stages cause a visibly negative impact on them and lead to a difficult transition into university. This article argues for a better connection between secondary and higher education.</str>

    <str name="description">Despite the unified system of admission to universities in Russia, applicants can still face unequal access to higher education. This article analyzes the barriers which restrict the inter-regional accessibility of higher education. We propose an analytical model, reflecting the direct and indirect influence of family, schools, and location on the educational strategies of youth, assuming that these factors affect the university enrollment both directly and indirectly through academic achievement. An empirical examination of the model, based on data from the longitudinal study 'Trajectories in Education and Careers', shows that students from Moscow are most likely to enroll at university, since they face the lowest barriers. The problem of the accessibility of higher education is more acute for residents of large cities or regional capitals: their likelihood of matriculating is limited by cognitive abilities, socio-economic status, and school characteristics. Residents of small towns or villages are facing the highest barriers and gender inequality.</str>

    <str name="description">Marketisation and competition within public schooling systems impact the work of principals in varying ways. Previous work on the marketisation of schooling and school autonomy has drawn attention to the 'entrepreneurial principal' as an effect of marketisation. In this paper we explore principals' engagements with marketisation based on 21 interviews with public school principals across two Australian states. Using the work of Christiaens (2020), we highlight a difference between entrepreneurialism and utility-maximisation in marketised systems, evident in how principals engage with leadership within these systems. For most principals in our study, engagements with marketisation were entangled with different orientations toward utility maximisation. Evidence of genuine entrepreneurship was far more scarce. We argue that the need to ensure school survival in a saturated market gives rise to a performative veneer of entrepreneurialism that is largely absent of innovation and the 'leap of faith' that lies at the heart of true entrepreneurialism.</str>

    <str name="description">Previous studies have associated participation in higher education with the formation of middle-class advantages. Studies have shown that graduates from affluent family backgrounds gain more advantages from graduate degrees and secure better job opportunities than their less privileged counterparts. Drawing on the Bourdieusian framework, this study uses qualitative interview data (n = 29) to examine how recent business graduates mobilise economic, cultural and social capital for their entry into the Finnish labour market. The context of the Finnish welfare society brings novel insights to research on the inheritance of different forms of capital. Our findings reveal that although middle-class students do have a head start in entry to the graduate labour market, the Finnish society and higher education system even out social inequalities in graduate employment as working-class students may utilise institutional resources, socialise with peers and accumulate work experience to cross structural and dispositional barriers.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines the effects of different forms of tracking on learning inequalities in compulsory education. We use longitudinal monitoring of four cohorts of students over a four-year period, from their entry into secondary 1 education until they enter secondary 2 education. Our data include 18,706 students. We use multilevel regression analyses to test the effects of different forms of tracking after controlling for students' sociodemographic and academic characteristics, and for contextual factors. Our results suggest not only that the effect of tracking is a composition effect or a peer effect, but that tracking &amp;quot;per se&amp;quot; explains a significant part of the variance in learning in the two educational contexts in our study. Our results confirm that educational policies and institutions play a pivotal role in the construction of learning inequalities and social reproduction through school in contemporary societies.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Using a unique database from Hungarian primary schools, this study investigates whether academic self-assessment and educational aspirations differ between Roma minority and non-Roma majority students with similar cognitive skills and abilities. I find that Roma students have lower self-assessment, on average, than their non-Roma classmates with similar competences. In addition, although there are no ethnic differences in educational aspirations two years before secondary school application, Roma students are less likely to actually apply to a secondary school track that provides the possibility to enter tertiary education. Roma students' lower socioeconomic status can partly explain these differences. The analysis also shows that students' self-assessment is more strongly related to teacher-given grades than to blind standardised test scores. The study highlights important mechanisms that can contribute to educational inequalities between minority and majority students.</str>

    <str name="description">This study aims to fill a gap in our understanding of the relationship between two major topics in educational research: higher education choices and students' conceptions of employability. It explores, first, the balance between vocational calling, instrumental considerations and chance in subject choice and, second, the relation between vocational calling and two alternative conceptions of employability (thin and thick) articulated in the article. Using survey data from 'Education' students in Spain, the results show an association between a strong vocational calling in subject choice and a 'thick' conception of employability that goes beyond credential performance and underlines the importance of an economy of experience. By contrast, students with lower vocational calling adopt a narrower ('thin') conception of employability, based on credential performance. The consequences of these results for theory and for practice are discussed, highlighting the need to better acknowledge the role of interests, and not only skills, in the employability agenda.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Cushing, Ian</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Racism is pervasive within the lives of racially minoritised pre-service teachers in England, but little work has explored how perceptions about language feature here. Based on interviews and workshops with 26 racially minoritised pre-service teachers, I describe their experiences of language oppression whilst on school experience placements, where they were instructed by mentors to modify, flatten, and completely abandon their ways of talking if they were to be perceived as legitimate. I show how language oppression gets justified by mentors in reference to national policy, and how perceptions about the quality of speech are ideologically anchored to perceptions about the quality of teaching. I show how language oppression often materialises under seemingly benevolent and humanitarian guises, but inevitably maintains the raciolinguistic status quo because it instructs racialised teachers to adapt their speech so that it appropriates whiteness. I argue that language oppression is a key reason why England continues to fail to retain racially marginalised teachers.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article examines the case of women full professors in a gendered and neoliberalised context to propose the concept of &amp;quot;complex reflexivity.&amp;quot; This concept refers to an internal conversation and accounts for the practical way in which people may ponder their ambiguities and contradictions. This paper presents the concrete experiences and practices of some women professors in relation to the institutional structure. The research is based on fieldwork conducted between November 2018 and December 2020, which includes interviews with 24 professors, as well as an ethnographic study. Their complex reflexivity combines adapting to the precarious conditions, &amp;quot;rebuscar&amp;quot; (unusual ways of getting resources), perceiving envy from their peers, and, at the same time, dealing with the administration, reducing the time dedicated to academic tasks, and developing caring and careful practices. With their actions, the professors navigate the shortcomings and conflicts in the university, but they also modify these supposedly immovable conditions.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Preston, John</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The role of 'class strategies' in policy formation is sometimes unseen as plans are unrealised in practice over long periods of historical time. 'Subterranean class strategies' are an extension of existing work on class to consider 'class work' on policy in the 'long unenacted'. Using the example of emergency feeding in a national crisis, the stark difference in school meal planning for post-World War 2 emergencies when compared to the COVID-19 crisis is discussed. Through an analysis of archival records, it is shown that 'subterranean class strategies' - the devaluation of school catering expertise by the army and the private sector, the lack of co-operation of independent schools, and localisation and privatisation - diminished the role of schools in emergency feeding. The paper concludes by considering how the concept of 'subterranean class strategies' could inform work on educational think tanks, privatisation and subsumption, and intersectional areas such as race.</str>

    <str name="description">As structural inequalities within universities persist, universities increasingly develop diversity policies. Much diversity research focuses on the gap between universities' commitments and actual practices. This paper takes a different approach by scrutinizing how diversity documents enact politics of time that results in their selective non-performativity. We demonstrate how diversity documents at a Dutch university compose diversity as a problem of time for which the near future is crucial. It legitimizes action in the here-and-now to realize the diverse future, while simultaneously delegitimizes it by envisioning diversity as a problem that resolves itself in time. Along such urgent, yet inevitable progress, a competition between gender and ethnic diversity emerges. As the documents engage in a white politics of time, change for white women becomes realizable in concrete, time-bound actions. In contrast, people of color appear to lag behind and have yet to arrive in a time where progress could be achieved.</str>

    <str name="description">Policy discourse on graduate internships rests on the assumption that, paid or unpaid, they improve the employability of interns. Employing data from a survey of UK creative and mass communications graduates, surveyed two to six years after graduation, this article examines the impact of graduate internships on subsequent job prospects. While paid internships are associated with better pay and increased chances of having a creative or graduate-level job, unpaid internships are not, and are associated with lower pay in the short to medium term. Findings contribute to theory by challenging the 'stepping stone' view of unpaid internships and much policy discussion about these. Results reinforce, with enhanced specificity about the role internships play in the graduate labour market, theories that characterise the graduate labour market as a 'positional' hierarchy of opportunities rather than a labour market that is essentially meritocratic in nature.</str>

      <str>Azaola, Marta Cristina</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper focuses on the perceptions of technical high school tutors in Mexico about students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds in the context of global curriculum reforms and institutional hierarchies. Through two novel concepts in education, culture of poverty and cultural deficiency, the paper explores: (a) how structural constraints shape tutors' perceptions and practices with students, and (b) how tutors' perceptions contribute to reconceptualise discourses of deficit and the culture of poverty in a more comprehensive way. Through in-depth semi-structured interviews with nine tutors working in Tijuana, Mexico City and Tuxtla Gutierrez, the main themes of analysis are: tutors' working conditions, their perceptions of and relationships with students, the quality of education on offer, curricular reforms, and behaviour management. Even if systemic factors contribute to tutors' perceptions of deficit amongst students, we found valuable experiences of empathy, trust, and encouragement amongst tutors that show both their agency and resilience.</str>

    <str name="description">This study focuses on what people working in edu-business want to achieve. The aim is to explore (1) how the edu-business sector is discursively constructed as a work-place and part of the education system, and (2) how this discourse is organized within an affective economy -- that is how the valuation of emotions distinguish what are considered as 'good' or 'bad' subjectivities, practices, and institutions. The analysis draws on interviews with 22 people working in Sweden's edu-business sector. The results illuminate three discourses: a bureaucratic, an entrepreneurial, and a profit discourse. Emotions attached to the bureaucratic discourse are anxiety, guilt, and boredom. Connected to the entrepreneurial discourse are joy, creativity, and well-being. Shame and pride are attached to the profit discourse. The affective economy constructs the business sector as desirable and the public sector as its opposite. Studying 'the bright side' of neoliberalism helps us to understand its power.</str>

    <str name="description">Enrollments in higher education have expanded greatly, but without elimination of all forms of inequality. Research in industrialized countries has shown that the path students follow in their transition from secondary school continues to be associated with their social class. This study provides quantitative evidence of that relationship in a non-industrial country like Chile. Multinomial logistic and linear regression of university admission data managed by the Department of Evaluation, Measurement and Registration describing 130,000 applicants for the years 2015 and 2017 were used to estimate the probability of a member of a particular social class choosing a given university and academic field of study. The results show differences regarding law programs and science, technology, engineering and mathematics programs. Class differences were particularly important in the choice of university. Working-class students were more likely to apply to public universities, avoiding elite and especially private institutions. The findings provide further support for Bourdieu's habitus explanation of class reproduction. They suggest more attention to the level of segregation in Chilean higher education and the factors that produce it.</str>

    <str name="description">This study examines how Chinese postgraduate students' personal worldviews are separately and collectively shaped by the interplay of neoliberalism, Confucianism and patriotism. The findings reveal that neoliberalism contributes to Chinese postgraduates' enterprising self by shaping their subjectivity in pursuing personal goals, influencing their thinking with the market logics of efficiency, effectiveness and ­quantifiable outcomes, and leaving them with a predisposition toward deregulation. Confucianism prompts the postgraduates to self-strengthen at the individual level and guides them with interaction norms at the interpersonal level. Patriotism underpins the postgraduates' psychological and emotional power based on strengthened memories of historical events and pride in national achievements, thereby generating a deep-seated collective identity. Counteracting and consolidating forces are identified based on the interplay of the three &amp;quot;isms,&amp;quot; resulting in the Chinese postgraduates' partial individualization. The partial individualization reflected in today's Chinese postgraduates features a consistent rather than divisible dual-self.</str>

    <str name="description">This article contributes to the sociology of education and technology by providing a cultural analysis of scepticism towards new technologies in school, using reactions to the telepresence robot 'AV1' as its case. AV1 is designed to connect 'homebound' students with their 'school-based' teachers and classmates. Despite its idealistic purpose, the robot has been met with significant scepticism by Norwegian school workers. To understand why, the article proposes the novel concepts of 'educational purity' and 'technological danger' to highlight the shared beliefs that underlie school workers' concerns. We find that school workers see AV1 as threatening key ideals of schools being pedagogically oriented, physically copresent and bounded institutions -- all concerns that reflect widespread ideas about how technologies tend to (not) function within educational contexts. In highlighting these symbolic tensions between new technologies and schools, the article sets a course for future studies into the cultural sociology of education and technology.</str>

    <str name="description">This qualitative case study provides an analysis of the structuring of middle-class aspirations at one rural university in the United States. Using a Bourdieusian framework offered by Zipin and colleagues, findings suggest that although student participants in our study are similarly positioned relative to social class background, those from distinct geographic areas (i.e. rural and urban) displayed key differences in expressions of college-going and future aspirations. We argue that place, as an important feature of one's habitus, structures students' college-going and future aspirations. Within the highly stratified context of higher education in the United States, few scholars have acknowledged the power of geography and place in shaping behaviors, choices, and possibilities for students. In doing so, this research contributes to a growing global body of literature examining the role of place in shaping students' higher education aspirations, access, experiences, and outcomes.</str>

    <str name="description">This study examines same-sex siblings' educational mobility using high-quality register data from Norway. The study explores how the educational level of younger siblings varies with the education of parents and firstborn siblings. Younger siblings are generally more likely to attain the same education as the eldest. Even though the distance and direction of educational mobility co-varies between the eldest and younger siblings, the association appears weaker when the firstborn children of highly educated parents only attain compulsory schooling. Furthermore, educational similarity within and across generations is particularly widespread among the families with the least and most educated parents. The study demonstrates how differentials in educational attainment by family background increase when comparing sibling pairs rather than individuals. Accordingly, researchers must also consider family outcomes to understand the stratification that follows intergenerational mobility.</str>

    <str name="description">Previous research has examined how mismatched dispositions within a divided or 'cleft' habitus are subjectively experienced but has not adequately explored nor theorized the variety of ways in which the dispositional disjunctures that progressively give rise to a cleft habitus are initially generated. Combining recent sociological work on ontological ruptures with an affective reading of Bourdieu's social theory, we use an empirical case to illustrate how subtle processes of social influence set in motion by affective ties can come to sever the ontological bond between the habitus and the social space that initially shaped it, setting an affectively driven and reflexively negotiated process of habitus change in motion. By shedding light upon some of the sufficient conditions underpinning the development of dispositional disjunctures and the psychosocial forces that mediate this process, we extend the literature on habitus change and conflict in several ways.</str>

    <str name="description">The aim of this paper is to investigate the 'equalising effect of schools' in general and two concrete interventions that have been carried out recently in Sweden in particular. The first of these interventions is the closing down of schools in deprived neighbourhoods and moving pupils to other schools. The second is 'empowerment'--i.e., creating an inclusive and supportive pedagogical school environment for students with working-class and immigrant backgrounds. As findings from previous Swedish studies regarding the first intervention show, an equalising effect will not be achieved without considering the 'school climate' of mixed schools. The findings from this case study of a school located in a deprived suburb of Stockholm County indicate that even schools in these areas are able to equalise educational opportunities through building an alliance between students, parents and community activists on the one hand and bi-class and bi-cultural brokers like teachers and social workers on the other.</str>

    <str name="description">Scant sociological attention has been given to the role of luck within social mobility/reproduction. This paper helps address this conceptual gap, drawing on insights from over 200 longitudinal interviews conducted with 20 working-class young people and 22 of their parents over an 11-year period, from age 10-21. We explore the potential significance of luck within the trajectories of 13 educationally mobile young people who were the first in family to go to university, six young people who achieved similar educational levels to their parents and one young person whose status was less clear cut. Our analysis suggests that particular forms of luck may be instrumental in creating opportunities for social mobility, although the consequentiality of these are mediated through interplays of agency, structure, habitus and capital. We conclude that paying further attention to luck may help augment sociological understandings of structure/agency and Bourdieusian understandings of social reproduction.</str>
