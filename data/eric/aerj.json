        "description":"This study examines teachers' discussions in a professional development setting to understand the ways in which learning a mathematics learning trajectory may change aspects of their discourse about students as learners. Using mixed methods, we bring together two theoretical frames that use a Vygotskian perspective on learning to analyze professional discussions among 22 elementary-grade teachers participating in a yearlong, 60-hour mathematics professional development program. Results indicate that over time, some discursive patterns for explaining students' academic performance changed to incorporate the trajectory, while others remained unaffected. Whereas this change transformed one of the patterns in a way that led to new explanations for student performance, another pattern changed only slightly and was still used to express the same explanations for performance.",

        "description":"We investigated whether the content pre-service teachers studied in elementary teacher preparation mathematics courses was related to their performance on a mathematics lesson planning task 2 and 3 years after graduation. The relevant mathematics knowledge was studied when the teachers were freshmen, 5 to 6 years earlier. Results showed that when there were differences in how completely graduates attended to the key mathematics concepts when planning lessons, the differences favored the topics studied in the courses, especially topics emphasized most heavily. We conjecture that teacher preparation can matter for lesson planning, an important task for teaching, if enough opportunities are provided to acquire the relevant content knowledge for teaching. We consider what this might mean for teacher preparation, more generally.",

        "description":"This article provides ethnographic evidence of the ways in which undocumented students make decisions about when to share or withhold their migratory status during conversations with peers and teachers in one elementary school. It argues that an analytic focus on how and when elementary-aged students talk about migratory status during everyday school activities can deepen our understanding of the educational experiences of a population that often remains invisible to teachers and educational researchers. The findings suggest ways in which public school and university educators can foster educational equity and inclusion for undocumented students.",

A total of 35 ninth-grade classes (N = 900) in Germany were randomly assigned to one of four conditions--live, video, text, or a (nontreated) control group--in a pretest, posttest, and follow-up design. Comparing the three intervention groups with the control group, the intervention groups scored better on four of the five achievement tests. Comparing the live group with the video and text groups, students in the live condition were more convinced of their learning progress at both measurement points. However, they scored lower than the video/text group on two achievement measures and higher on one at the posttest.",

Using data from a large, nationally representative sample with extensive covariates, we employ propensity score weighting to adjust comparisons of children who do and do not participate in arts education (music and performing arts lessons) to address potential confounding from selection into arts education. We examine a broad range of outcomes in adolescence and early adulthood (e.g., GPA, self-esteem, college attendance). Our results show that selection into arts education is at least as strong as any direct effect on outcomes, providing no support for the causal associations between arts participation and cognitive outcomes. We do find that arts education increases arts engagement during young adulthood.",

        "description":"The for-profit college sector is arguably the most controversial and least understood sector of higher education today. The past decade has ushered in a wealth of public concern and scrutiny as to whether for-profit colleges and universities are providing a quality education to underserved student populations. While their politicization has captured immense attention, there is far less empirical research on student experiences at for-profit institutions to better inform conceptual, institutional, and practical understanding of this sector of postsecondary education. Using ethnographic data from one midsize for-profit college in a suburban city, the author spent seven months exploring educational culture from the perspective of enrolled students. The findings illuminate four themes: (a) student desire for institutional transparency, (b) the perception of high-quality in-person instruction, (c) varied experiences based on student schedule and learning needs, and (d) the role of age in shaping peer interactions.",

        "description":"Despite the vast body of research examining the relationship between full-day kindergarten attendance and children's outcomes, little is known about the effects of full-day kindergarten on children with disabilities (i.e., students with 1 of the 13 categories of disabilities recognized under federal law). This study fills this research void by examining whether full-day kindergarten participation predicts differences in achievement and social-emotional outcomes for children with disabilities. Using a national data set of kindergarten students from the 2010-2011 school year (ECLS-K:2011) and employing propensity matching, this study finds that relative to part-day kindergarten (PDK), full-day kindergarten (FDK) attendance is associated with higher achievement scores but also with higher frequencies of internalizing behaviors and lower incidences of self-control at the end of the kindergarten school year. The relationships between FDK attendance and outcomes varied by type of disability classification, such that significant achievement effects emerged only for children with learning and communication disorders. In addition, less time spent on child-initiated activities was associated with higher mathematics scores for children in FDK programs but not for children in PDK programs. Policy implications of the results are discussed.",

        "author":["D'Amico, Diana"],
        "description":"In 1968, New York City's unionized teachers participated in three separate strikes that spanned two school years. Teachers clashed with Black parents and activists who called for community control as both groups sought authority and recognition in the schools. Racialized assumptions in place before and extending beyond the labor skirmish infused teachers' professional identity as well as how they understood their students and the communities they served. This article provides a history of how constructions of Blackness and Whiteness permeated teacher preparation programs, administrative policies, and the teachers' union, in turn delimiting teachers' collective professional persona. This historical analysis provides a framework to understand the persistent strains between social institutions and the communities they serve.",

Moreover, we investigate the effect of a school's proportion of retained students on these friendships and the moderating effect of this school characteristic on the relationship between retention and the number of same-grade friendships. Multilevel analyses on data from 11,759 students in 83 Flemish secondary schools show that secondary school retention is related to a lower number of friendships. Primary school retention is unrelated to friendship quantity in secondary education. Furthermore, students attending schools with a higher percentage of retained students have fewer same-grade friendships. The retention composition also moderates the effect of individual grade retention on the number of same-grade friendships. The implications are discussed.",

        "description":"Non-parental arrangements for young children serve a dual function as supports for parental activities and educational inputs for children. However, arrangements that are suited to meet families' specific needs and preferences are sometimes in tension with experts' definitions of &quot;quality.&quot; Researchers and policymakers increasingly emphasize that educational goals cannot be met until this tension is reconciled. I offer new institutionalism as a conceptual framework for these emerging conversations and propose two ideal-typical institutional logics: the logic of the family and the logic of education. This perspective emphasizes that different expectations and goals are related to individuals' differing social and institutional locations. Secondary analyses of the National Institute of Child Health and Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) data offer preliminary empirical evidence.",

Across the globe, educational changes are seen as fundamental to the creation of peaceful, tolerant, and democratic civic identities, the key to &quot;social reconstruction, a better future, and a lasting peace.&quot; Drawing on qualitative data from varied schools in postwar Guatemala, this article illustrates a critical dilemma in post-conflict civic education: the difficulties of engaging directly with past and present injustice while moving toward a shared national identity. Global models of democratic, multicultural, and human rights education alone are inadequate for creating a new sense of citizenship in a country in which young people's sense of belonging and their interpretations of the past are deeply connected to how their communities are positioned within a profoundly inequitable power structure.",

Using student-unit record data from two large community college systems linked to wage record data, this is the first study to estimate the labor market returns to developmental education. For two cohorts of students who attended community college in North Carolina and Virginia, we find that earning developmental English credits led to an increase in earnings due to an increased likelihood of employment. In contrast, in both states, developmental math credits had negative impacts on earnings, particularly for those assigned to the lowest level of the developmental math sequence.",

We consider how the teacher framed the construct of civic efficacy and how the students refracted these ideas in their navigation of a civic education project. Closely analyzing these students' experiences and responses, we question what differences are made when students are encouraged to think of themselves as citizens who can make a difference. Noting dissonances and ambivalences in the students' responses, the conceptual resources of &quot;figured worlds&quot; enable an analysis of the interplay of discourses, interactions, sensory experiences, and material artifacts as civic identities are constituted. The two students' differing responses are analyzed in relation to other figured worlds that students and teachers daily negotiate: of compliant citizenship, productive citizenship, and consumer citizenship. The overlaps, dissonances, and/or divergences in discourses and artifacts from various figured worlds of citizenship render some students more recognizable as civically &quot;engaged&quot; and &quot;efficacious&quot; than others.",

The basic premise is twofold: (a) that peer interaction provides opportunities to access teaching relevant knowledge and thus may reduce uncertainty and (b) that self-efficacy beliefs may be shaped by the efficacy beliefs of the peers one is directly connected to in the advice network. The results suggest that both mechanisms may shape teacher self-efficacy and that the quality of ties, rather than the quantity, may have a stronger influence on self-efficacy.

However, little work examines how school-based linguistic status may influence this advantage. Contradictory patterns exist: Research identifies both an immigrant advantage and a language minority disadvantage in college going. Although not all immigrant youth are language minorities, many do speak other languages. U.S. educators group immigrant students into three discrete linguistic categories: native English speakers, language minorities not in English as a second language (ESL), and English learner (EL) students. We employ multivariate methods to investigate immigrant college going by linguistic status using the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002. Results suggest an immigrant advantage only among immigrant groups not in ESL and evidence of undermatching--wherein students choose postsecondary options for which they are over-prepared--among high-achieving EL students. Disentangling the immigrant advantage might improve EL students' college going, stemming this loss of human capital.",

Though teachers are central to this expectation, there is little evidence about whether teachers in PCS enjoy more autonomy and are held more accountable than teachers in TPS. Also, it is unclear what the franchising of the PCS sector--the growth of schools run by educational management organizations (EMOs)--means for teacher autonomy and accountability. Using nationally representative survey data, this article compares teachers' perceptions of autonomy and accountability in PCS and TPS and in EMO-run and non-EMO-run PCS. It shows that teachers in PCS reported greater autonomy than teachers in TPS; similarly, teachers in non-EMO-run schools indicated greater autonomy than teachers in EMO-run schools.

Using a randomized controlled trial design with 33 treatment and 33 control schools across three school districts in one state, we found significant and meaningfully sized intervention effects on a researcher-developed science assessment and the state science assessment. Subgroup analyses revealed that the P-SELL intervention had a positive and significant effect for each language proficiency group (ELLs, recently reclassified ELLs, former ELLs, and non-ELLs) on the researcher-developed assessment. The intervention also had a positive effect for former ELLs and non-ELLs on the state science assessment, but for ELLs and recently reclassified ELLs, the effect was not statistically significant.",

Using a 20-year longitudinal data set, this study estimates the association between children's academic skills, antisocial behaviors, and attention problems-all averaged across middle childhood--and their long-term educational outcomes. After adjusting for family and individual background measures, we find that high average levels of math and reading achievement, and low average levels of antisocial behavior problems, are positively associated with later attainment. Associations between attention problems and attainment are small. Associations are attenuated somewhat when sibling differences in these skills and behaviors are related to sibling differences in attainment outcomes.",

In this article, we consider the organizational processes that accompanied this curricular intensification. Facing a complex set of accountability, institutional, technical/functional, and internal political pressures, California schools responded to the algebra-for-all effort in diverse ways. While some schools detracked by enrolling all eighth graders in algebra, others &quot;tracked up,&quot; creating more advanced geometry opportunities while increasing algebra enrollments. These responses created a new differentiated course structure that is likely to benefit advantaged students. Consistent with the effectively maintained inequality hypothesis, we find that detracking occurred primarily in disadvantaged schools while &quot;tracking up&quot; occurred primarily in advantaged schools.",

Based on interviews with a sample (n = 40) of undergraduates recruited from two U.S. West Coast public research universities, constructivist grounded theory methods allowed for an emergent understanding of how precollege experiences and campus contexts influenced race-related patterns in students' experiencing of and learning about race. Such experiences contributed to six patterns of racial meaning (ancestry, culture, concept, embodiment, identity, power) that help explain how college students refute postracial claims and see race mattering (or not) on multiple levels.",

Between-district income segregation of families with children enrolled in public school increased by over 15% from 1990 to 2010. Within large districts, between-school segregation of students who are eligible and ineligible for free lunch increased by over 40% from 1991 to 2012. Consistent with research on neighborhood segregation, we find that rising income inequality contributed to the rise in income segregation between schools and districts during this period.

Individuals who serve as cultural brokers play critical, though complex, roles bridging between schools and families. Using an equitable collaboration lens with boundary-spanning theory, this comparative case study examined how individuals enacted cultural brokering within three organizational contexts. Our findings suggest a predominance of cultural brokering consistent with programmatic goals to socialize nondominant families into school-centric norms and agendas. However, formal leadership and boundary-spanning ambiguity enabled more collective, relational, or reciprocal cultural brokering. These dynamics suggest potential stepping stones and organizational conditions for moving toward more equitable forms of family-school collaboration and systemic transformation.",

Based on analyses of school culture and firewalk enactment, I argue that authentic cariño is essential to nondominant students' success and that rituals like firewalks productively help youth negotiate emergent cultural identities and develop collective social conscience, reflexivity, and agency.",

Or are they new public spaces relevant to the needs of certain communities? Through a case study of one potentially &quot;counterpublic&quot; school, I describe how this school embodied aspects of public-ness.

Drawing on nationally representative longitudinal data and social capital theory, this research investigates the process of four-year college enrollment among different immigrant generations of Hispanic adolescents. Of particular interest is how parents of Hispanic youth use resources embedded in their social networks to promote their children's engagement in college-aligned actions and whether this process varies according to student immigrant generation status. Results suggest that regardless of immigrant generation, Hispanic students who take instrumental steps during high school that are aligned with admission to college have a greater probability of initially enrolling in a four-year institution. Importantly, however, the influence of different forms of parent social capital during the process of four-year college enrollment varies markedly according to student immigrant generation.",

        "description":"In this article, we explore how organizational routines involving instructional rounds--collective, structured observations and reflections on classroom practice--might contribute to the development of social networks among administrators and support a common, district-wide focus on instruction. Building on work on communities of practice, we consider some of the mechanisms through which rounds might contribute to the development of the relationships, common language, and shared understanding integral to building social capital. Our analysis focuses on the evolution of social networks among administrators in three districts. While this initial analysis does not find a consistent association between engagement in rounds and the development of social networks that have the characteristics of communities of practice, it points to several key factors that need to be taken into account in order to use rounds strategically to support the development of connections among administrators who may not normally come into contact with one another.",

We complement the growing evidence base for these teachers by exploring their turnover patterns in four waves of the nationally representative Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). We report on descriptive evidence of growing differences in the characteristics of alternatively and traditionally certified teachers and the schools in which they teach. Controlling for factors that predict higher turnover, we find that by the 2007-2008 school year, alternatively certified teachers were still more likely than traditionally certified teachers to leave the profession. We find some evidence that an increase in the number of organizational supports for new teachers may reduce the likelihood of turnover.",

Du Bois on race and the political economy has led many of his readers to misunderstand and underestimate his additional important contributions to and perspectives on education. In addition, some of his work not commonly read by educators as well as his unpublished musings from later life may have left some of his most profound thinking concerning pedagogy less broadly available. One of the authors of this commentary claims to have had access to Du Bosian resources and to have enjoyed a privileged perspective based on extended personal exchanges with him as well as having read just about everything that Du Bois has published.

Their positioning and findings of culture as an advantage in regard to positively influencing student outcomes in schools in Hawai'i is a story many of us in the field of Indigenous education have been waiting to hear. While qualitative research in the field has shown the benefits of culture-based education (CBE) to students' cultural identity, self-confidence, and sense of belonging (Kawagley &amp; Barnhardt, 2004; Kulago, 2016; Lee, 2015), there has been very limited quantitative research that demonstrates these significant connections to these areas in addition to outcomes related to college aspirations and connections to community (but see e.g., recent quantitative work on Native language and culture instruction by Van Ryzin, Vincent, &amp; Hoover, 2016). Kana'iaupuni et al.'s work is groundbreaking, and Tiffany Lee titled her Commentary using phrases from their article that she believes capture the magnitude of their work for the field of Indigenous education. She explains the significance of each phrase herein.

        "author":["Núñez, Anne-Marie"],
        "description":"Advancing the educational success of the Latinx population can significantly affect overall postsecondary attainment since Latinxs comprise the largest and fastest growing non-White population in the country yet historically have among the lowest rates of postsecondary attainment (Kelly, Schneider, &amp; Carey, 2010). Arguably, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) constitute a critical part of the ''marginalized majority,'' yet they contribute significantly to Latinx postsecondary attainment, graduating an estimated 40% of Latinx bachelor's degree recipients and 54% of those earned in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math fields (Harmon, 2012; Hixson, 2009). Garcia's work advances research on this &quot;marginalized majority&quot; of institutions. Extending more recent work on institutional and demographic characteristics of HSIs (e.g., Nunez, Crisp, &amp; Elizondo, 2016), Garcia's research focuses on HSIs as organizations, providing a corrective to the tendency of higher education research on HSIs to focus on the individual student as the sole unit of analysis (Stevens, 2015). As Garcia notes, the central question that researchers, policymakers, and HSI leaders are grappling with today is, ''How do HSIs serve Latinx students?'' Focusing on organizational identity provides an essential lens to identify how various actors (e.g., faculty, students, administrators) make sense of their status navigating an HSI. Garcia builds a rich corpus of data through interviews, observations, document analysis, and analyses of graduation rates. Through this process, she provides a more nuanced view of organizational identity, which can yield informed ''ground measures'' (Deil-Amen, 2015) of organizational identity and behavior.

        "description":"Cross-sector collaborations can generate the resources and political will necessary to tackle urgent, complex issues. Because these partnerships involve local leaders, they are typically responsive to their surrounding communities, addressing local concerns, and capitalizing upon local assets. These strengths-oriented, locally driven collaborations therefore offer a promising model for improving rural schools and developing rural communities (Bauch, 2001; Schafft, 2016). As Miller, Scanlan, and Phillippo's case study carefully details, the longstanding &quot;Kids Committee&quot; (KC) partnership in the rural community of Midvale shares these qualities: dense bonding relationships, tight networks of cross-sector support, and a focus on addressing high poverty rates and low achievement test scores. But, in the final year of their study, this promising collaboration unravels. The authors argue that it is undone, in large part, by a distrust of &quot;outsiders&quot;--in this case, individuals born outside of Midvale or living in a neighboring town. This distrust causes the unique perspectives and useful connections of &quot;outsider&quot; stakeholders to be dismissed, and ultimately, these leaders leave for other jobs, representing, in the authors' view, a lost opportunity for Midvale and its schools. This commentary offers a brief historical background to contextualize this collaboration and its unraveling, and names two other dimensions--race and class--that, although often unexplored in rural research, texture rural communities and shape rural change work.

        "description":"Controversy surrounding the role of non-English languages in American education has a long history. In the 100 years in which the American Educational Research Association (AERA) has been in existence, two Supreme Court decisions have addressed this issue (&quot;Meyer v. Nebraska,&quot; 1923, and &quot;Lau v. Nichols,&quot; 1974); federal legislation has authorized and reauthorized compensatory bilingual education over 3 decades; and state legislation has first authorized and then prohibited or strongly limited the use of the primary languages of Indigenous and immigrant-origin students in education (e.g., Proposition 227 in California and Proposition 203 in Arizona). As AERA begins its second hundred years of existence, the inclusion of the article, &quot;Effects of Dual-Language Immersion Programs on Student Achievement: Evidence from Lottery Data,&quot; by Steele et al. in the Centennial Issue of &quot;American Educational Research Journal&quot; (&quot;AERJ&quot;) is significant in that it brings into focus the central position of language in American education. It is important to stress that, until the last decade or so, research on bilingual education had been published primarily in specialized language-oriented journals (&quot;Bilingual Research Journal,&quot; &quot;TESOL Quarterly,&quot; &quot;International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism&quot;) and, except for members of the Bilingual Education special interest group, was not well known to the general AERA membership. Inclusion of language issues as part of the larger focus on diversity and equity is a welcome direction. In this brief commentary, Guadalupe Valdés situates this article within established and more recent work in bilingual education for &quot;AERJ&quot; readers who may be new to this area of study.

Although guided by powerful ideals of equal opportunity, American schools are deeply unequal. As historians of education have taught, children of different racial, ethnic, and class backgrounds have traditionally attended different schools. As well, most reform efforts have had limited impact in eroding this pattern. Today, most American children continue to attend the ''catchment'' school where they live, and U.S. neighborhoods remain very inequitable. However, Anna Rhodes and Siri Warkentien remind the reader that the world is changing. While older, inner-ring suburbs are becoming racially integrated, the pattern of ''chocolate cities and vanilla suburbs'' is shifting. Recent research predicts that over a number of years approximately one-third of these integrated suburban neighborhoods will be transformed into racially segregated neighborhoods (often dominated by Latino/a residents), while others will maintain a level of integration. In this article, the authors think about how inequality can be reduced through educational policies.

        "description":"The article ''Transforming Educational Experiences in Low-Income Communities'' analyzes the efforts of a highly impoverished small elementary school to provide the kind of wrap-around services children in very poor communities need to give them a fair chance to succeed. For a child from a low-income family, what happens in the non-educational part of his or her life is often far more determinative than what happens in the classroom. In the absence of family resources and knowledge of the system, the school can become very important in connecting children to essential resources. As a faculty advisor to Harvard's Collaborative for Integrated School Services (1900-2003), Gary Orfield saw successful examples in various parts of the country. Full-service schools, however, never became a basic part of educational reform, though research shows that out-of-school conditions greatly impact school success. This article links the school's success to the social capital of the staff and a well-connected school principal but argues that efforts were limited by the tension between the Latinos who made up more than two-thirds of the school's enrollment and the African American and American Indian children and parents who often felt neglected.

The authors of this commentary find their analysis important, especially given the role of emotions in learning and educational achievement--a link that in general has been neglected so far by scientists and policymakers. This commentary focuses on the idea of embodiment and how the different level of emotional embodiment experienced by individuals might interact with cognitive embodiment. Within the cognitive domain, the authors focus on numerical cognition.

A longstanding tension in the history of educational research has been conceptualizations of the goal of such work as discovering foundational principles about how people learn and impacting practice in ways that address inequalities in opportunity to learn. In many respects, the work of San Pedro, Kinloch, and others on what they are calling Projects in Humanization sits at the intersection of discoveries of foundational knowledge and improving practices that support the full and holistic development of humans. This commentary raises questions about the phrasing &quot;humanizing&quot; discourse and practices and addresses a theme about centralizing &quot;the concerns of the people and communities with whom we work.&quot; [This article offers a commentary on &quot;Toward Projects in Humanization: Research on Co-Creating and Sustaining Dialogic Relationships&quot; (EJ1155346).]",

        "description":"Adam Wright, Michael A. Gottfried, and Vi-Nhuan Le demonstrate empirically that minority teachers have a positive impact on the &quot;social-emotional development&quot; of American minority kindergarten children. Their analyses of 2010-2011 data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study focus on measurable effects in four social and affective domains: self-control, externalizing behaviors, interpersonal skills, and approaches to learning. This is a significant contribution to decades of qualitative and quantitative evidence on the effects of minority teachers and minority hiring policies, which have a difficult and politically charged history over the six decades since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. As Wright and colleagues observe, while the school-age population of minority children and youth--African American, Latino, Asian American, Native American, and migrant and refugee communities-- continues to grow beyond majority in many urban schools, districts, and states, the teaching workforce remains predominantly White. In another recent analysis of a national longitudinal database on effective teaching, Cherng and Halpin (2016) show that minority students consistently rate Black and Latino teachers higher across a range of measures. Both studies cite the extensive empirical literature that makes the case for what Wright et al. here refer to as &quot;cultural synchrony&quot;: aggregate educational benefits of alignment of the cultural and racial backgrounds of teachers with those of their students. In relation to the Australian context where the author lives and works, several findings of a large-scale empirical study of school and leadership reform in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education (Luke et al. 2013) are relevant to questions of cultural synchrony--or indeed, to questions of &quot;cultural asynchrony&quot; (Carbaugh, 2014): where intercultural communication and exchange breaks down, fails, or where it is institutionally or systemically precluded or blocked.

        "description":"The Centennial article by Ruben Donato and Jarrod Hanson demonstrates the critical importance of writing the history of America's variegated ethnicity not only for a comprehensive understanding of the past but also to inform future struggles to overturn segregation and inequality in America's schools (see e.g., Ball, 2006). Donato and Hanson portray a quasi-legal, largely de facto tri-racial stratification system in Kansas designed mainly to accommodate White civic interest in segregating Mexican students. The authors do an excellent job of uncovering the nuanced, contradictory, and customary ways in which various cities within Kansas arranged to segregate Mexican students in segregated schools. They also demonstrate the international context in which Mexican segregation unfolded; Mexican nationals with children in Kansas's schools frequently contacted their consul to protest the assignment of their children to separate and unequal schools and classrooms. In vital respects, the segregation of Mexicans in Kansas represents segregation through institutionalized racism in contradiction to the legally mandated system that characterized the segregation of African American children. Hence, this history informs current and future struggles for education equality as school segregation and inequality in today's America is based squarely on institutional racism. Donato and Hansen's historical analysis enables us to comprehend segregation and resistance from an angle of vision that is uniquely Mexican.

Drawing on an ethnographic study of Homeward Bound (pseudonym), a program for Vietnamese youth in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, we show how immigrant youth organizing functions as civic preparation. We identify three processes. Organizing has the potential to (a) develop the critical orientation of immigrant youth participants and prepare them to (b) navigate the unique political dynamics within their local communities and (c) work cooperatively and productively with other communities. The study demonstrates the capacity of immigrant youth organizing to help close civic empowerment gaps.",

Semi-structured interviews with 46 alumni of two race-conscious college access programs illustrate how participants employ a race-conscious framework that affirms the reality of race-conscious policies. Their discourse addressing race, intersectionality, and equity disrupts colorblind ideology. Connecting our analysis to the current social landscape, we argue intersectionality offers a framework for engaging politics of accountability.

Short-term and sustained effects (6 weeks and 5 months after the intervention) of the two intervention conditions on students' competence beliefs (self-concept, homework self-efficacy), teacher-rated individual effort, and standardized test scores in mathematics were assessed. Hierarchical linear regression analyses showed that students' homework self-efficacy was higher in both intervention groups 6 weeks and 5 months after the intervention compared to the control condition. Students' self-concept, teacher-rated effort, and achievement in mathematics were promoted through the quotations condition, partly in the long term.",

Using longitudinal administrative data--including achievement data from untested grades--and teacher survey data from a large urban district, we examine schools' responses to those pressures in assigning teachers to high-stakes and low-stakes classrooms. We find that teachers with more positive performance measures in both tested and untested classrooms are more likely to be placed in a tested classroom in the following year. Performance measures even more strongly predict a high-stakes teaching assignment in schools with low state accountability grades and where principals exercise more assignment influence. In elementary schools, we show that such &quot;strategic&quot; teacher assignment disadvantages early grades, concentrating less effective teachers in K-2 classrooms. Reassignment of ineffective upper-grades teachers to early grades systematically results in lower K-2 math and reading achievement gains. Moreover, evidence suggests that students' lower early-grades achievement persists into subsequent tested grades.",

An alternative approach assumes that programs should be adapted to local contexts. In this randomized trial of a reading intervention, we study a scaffolded sequence of implementation in which schools first develop proficiency by implementing the program with fidelity before implementing structured adaptations. We find evidence supporting the scaffolded sequence: A fidelity-focused approach promoted learning and instructional change more so for teachers inexperienced with the intervention, while a structured adaptive approach was more effective for teachers experienced with the intervention. Students benefited more from the structured adaptive approach but only when their teacher had prior experience with the fidelity-focused version.",

Schools may have unequal access to social capital due to the pattern of relationships in the school-partner network. Using data on school resource needs, sociometric measures, and a set of multilevel logit models, the results of a study of 211 New York City public high schools and 1,098 partner organizations from 1999 to 2005 suggest that high schools have unequal access to partner resources. Already well-endowed schools, in terms of having many experienced teachers or being embedded in dense networks, are most likely to partner. Disadvantaged schools, in terms of having many low socioeconomic status students or being in high-competition network positions, are least likely to partner. So, some policies promoting school partnerships may unintentionally reinforce existing structural inequalities among schools.",

Think-aloud data from 27 accomplished high school students revealed that in no instances did students engage in the intended processes. Rather, the items typically elicited three construct-irrelevant processes: factual recall/recognition, reading comprehension, and test-taking strategies. Further, findings revealed that although the items often prompted students to engage in factual recall, they were often not sound indicators of student knowledge.

Following Kane (2006), Wilson (2004), and the guidelines of the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (Standards: AERA, APA, &amp; NCME, 2014), findings suggest the IVC-R is a valid instrument for measuring fidelity to CSR.

This research builds on Bronfenbrenner's ecological model to consider both the locally and globally situated nature of resources across refugees' ecosystems. Analysis examines the nature and content of student-identified supports and their perceived influence on access to and persistence in school as well as the mediating role of technology. The findings suggest consideration of both locally situated relationships and globally situated relationships as critical educational supports. Implications include leveraging naturally occurring virtual relationships to support educational success of refugees and other young people who are physically isolated from access to needed supports in their local region.",

We use longitudinal data on public school students, teachers, and schools from two states--North Carolina and Washington--to provide a descriptive history of the evolution of TQGs in these states. We find that TQGs exist in every year in each state, and for all measures, we consider student disadvantage and teacher quality. But there is variation in the magnitudes and sources of TQGs over time, between the two states, and depending on the measure of student disadvantage and teacher quality.",

Three-level hierarchical generalized linear models are employed to analyze cross-national data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Results reveal that teacher salaries and societal evaluations about the importance of job responsibility and respect are positively associated with teaching career expectations, while working hours are negatively associated with teaching career expectations. Analyses further reveal that the association between salaries and career expectations and societal evaluations and career expectations differ among students with different mathematics skills. We conclude by discussing policy initiatives that can encourage students with strong quantitative abilities to consider a career in teaching.",

        "description":"Teachers are increasingly called on to use dialogic teaching practices to engage active pupil participation in academically challenging classroom discourse. Such practices are in tension with commonly held beliefs about pupil ability as fixed and/or context independent. Moreover, teaching practices that seek to make pupil thinking visible can also make perceived pupil &quot;inarticulateness&quot; and/or &quot;low ability&quot; visible, with important implications for pupil identities. This article explores how teachers in a dialogic teaching intervention managed the participation and identities of &quot;low ability&quot; pupils. We use linguistic ethnographic methods to analyze three different case studies in which teachers seek to include underachieving pupils' voices in the discussion and discuss implications for dialogic pedagogy and the study of classroom social identification processes.",

        "description":"Publicly funded pre-K is often touted as a means to narrow achievement gaps, but this goal is less likely to be achieved if poor and/or minority children do not, at a minimum, attend equal quality pre-K as their non-poor, non-minority peers. In this paper, I find large &quot;quality gaps&quot; in public pre-K between poor, minority students and non-poor, non-minority students, ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 SD on a range of classroom observational measures. I also find that even after adjusting for several classroom characteristics, significant and sizable quality gaps remain. Finally, I find much between-state variation in gap magnitudes and that state-level quality gaps are related to state-level residential segregation. These findings are particularly troubling if a goal of public pre-K is to minimize inequality.",

Financial incentives should induce colleges to improve performance, but there are several well-documented reasons why this is unlikely to occur. We examine how two of the most robust performance funding states--Tennessee and Ohio--responded to the policy. Using a difference-in-differences design, findings point to null and negative effects where colleges responded by producing fewer associate's degrees or not increasing bachelor's degree productivity. The only positive and robust effects were found among Tennessee community colleges that responded by producing significantly more certificates. Findings are consistent with performance management literature, where policy impacts are often muted or limited to a narrow range of outcomes.",

The perception of the major being math or science oriented is less important. We replicate these findings using a separate sample to measure college major traits.

Quantitative results show that while teachers' beliefs did not predict with whom they interacted about mathematics instruction, teachers' interactions with peers about mathematics instruction were associated with changes in their beliefs over time. Qualitative analysis confirms and extends these findings, revealing how system-level changes in the district's educational infrastructure facilitated change in teachers' beliefs about mathematics instruction at scale.",

        "description":"Career academies are increasingly prominent in American secondary education. However, our understanding of these academies is limited by a paucity of research about the factors that make them viable and effective. This case study highlights, from the perspective of 52 academy coordinators and teachers and 41 students, distinctive features that enable career academies to provide valuable job-related experiences and improve student engagement. Employing the theoretical framework of social capital, the findings emphasize the importance of boundary spanners who have the ability to maintain relationships between industry and educational institutions, bounded solidarity that facilitates an exchange of resources within an academy, and the information potential of the academy in terms of academic and personal support for students outside of the classroom.",

Structural equation modeling confirmed significant associations between experiences in teacher education and discomfort with student diversity, endorsement of mastery- and performance-oriented practices, and reluctance to adjust instruction to culturally diverse student needs. The number of multicultural education courses completed negatively predicted preservice teachers' stereotype beliefs and positively predicted mastery orientation. Reluctance to accommodate to culturally diverse students' educational needs mediated relations between stereotype beliefs and discomfort with student diversity with mastery- and performance-oriented practices. This demonstrates that general stereotype beliefs can inform proximal cultural intentions and instructional practices.",

Analyses of administrative data for 7 cohorts of students over 3 years in one district and 2 years in another revealed a considerable number of students meeting all criteria, and a nonoverlapping group meeting at least standardized-test criteria, were not reclassified, implicating this practice in the production of long-term EL status. However, the rate of not reclassifying was more than 2 to 5 times higher in one district than the other. Analyses of policy documents, reclassification decision forms, staff interviews, and surveys revealed that undergirding these differences were distinct reclassification policies and practices. We discuss policy, practice, and research implications, including issues of opportunity to learn, equity, and the need for a common definition of ELs involving a common set of specific criteria and standardized processes for reclassification statewide.",

Drawing on democratic theory, empirical literature, and data from 10 districts, we find that even when district leaders committed to involving stakeholders in decision-making, achieving this vision was often constrained by power imbalances, deeply engrained institutional habits, and limited capacity. We also find that climates of trust, support from external organizations, and homogeneity appeared to provide the foundation for deeper, broader democratic engagement in a few cases.

Effects on Level 1 random slope parameters suggest that a match of Black male students with Black teachers is associated with higher reading scores for this group, as is a match of Black female students with a Black or Hispanic teacher.

        "description":"While prior studies have examined the efficacy of career and technical education (CTE) courses on high school students' outcomes, there is little knowledge on timing of these courses and a potential link to student outcomes. We asked if the timing of these courses predicted differences in the likelihood of dropout and on-time high school graduation as well as college-going behaviors. We found that CTE coursetaking in high school was linked to lower chances of dropout and increased chances of on-time graduation, especially when these courses were taken later in high school. Little evidence arose that CTE coursetaking boosts college-going behaviors. The implications speak to the role of timing of CTE coursetaking, specifically on end of high school outcomes.",

In contrast the neoclassical-economic account postulates that switching is necessary for competition among schools. We argue that both frames fail to capture social-referential and institutional comparisons that drive student mobility, hypothesizing that pupil mobility stems from the (a) student's time in school and grade; (b) student's race, class, and achievement relative to peers; (c) quality of schooling relative to nearby alternatives; and (4) proximity, abundance, and diversity of local school options. Propositions are tested with discrete-time hazard models using data from Los Angeles, including 6.5 million observations. We find the student's position relative to peers, relative school quality, and proximity to local alternatives contribute significantly to the likelihood of switching schools, beyond the effects of individual pupil or family attributes. Implications for understanding &quot;choice&quot; as a social-referential process within diverse organizational fields like urban education markets are discussed.",

Multilevel regression analyses were conducted for a sample of 60 fourth- and 54 sixth-grade classrooms. The use of student experiments, the elicitation of student explanations, and lack of clarity accounted to varying degrees for disparities in science interest between grade levels.

A total of 764 fifth graders, mostly African Americans and Hispanic Americans, from 36 classrooms in eight public schools serving children from low-income families completed a six-week unit on wolf management, using either direct instruction or collaborative groups, or were waited-listed controls. Analysis of children's essays on a topic unrelated to wolves revealed that students who participated in collaborative groups but not students who received direct instruction acquired decision-making strategies and transferred them to the novel task. Students in collaborative group work classrooms wrote essays that were significantly better than essays of students from direct instruction classrooms in each of the three aspects of decision making that were evaluated--considering more than one side of a dilemma, comprehensiveness of reasons, and weighing the importance of reasons. In contrast, direct instruction students performed no better than uninstructed control students.",

We offer evidence of a similar phenomenon accounting for differential patterns of research skill development in graduate students over an academic year and explore differences in socialization that accompany diverging developmental trajectories. As predicted, quantitative analysis indicated large effect sizes for skill gains after controlling for initial performance levels. Qualitative analyses indicated that students with initial advantages were more likely to report greater demands of independence by their advisors and see more extensive value in research tasks comparable to those assigned their less skilled peers.",

This article uses measures of educational attainment in the previous two generations to consider whether parents' own histories of educational mobility and reproduction explain inequalities in how students prepare for college. Results suggest differences across generational categories in the types of colleges to which students apply and in the effects of parent-student discussions about topics related to college planning. These differences are explained by distinguishing the resources some families acquire through upward mobility from the resources that accumulate in families where educational privileges have been previously reproduced.",

Recent research has explored the extent to which inequalities in education are due to primary effects (i.e., achievement differentials) versus secondary effects (i.e., choice behaviors net of achievement). We explore educational expectations in order to consider whether variations in primary and secondary effects are associated with country variation in curricular and ability stratification. We use evidence from the PISA 2003 database to test the hypothesis that (a) greater between-school academic stratification would be associated with stronger relationships between socioeconomic status and educational expectations and (b) when this effect is decomposed, achievement differentials would explain a greater proportion of this relationship in countries with greater stratification.

However, the mechanisms linking EAP to educational outcomes are poorly understood. Using the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), this study contributes to our understanding of the relationship between EAP and educational success by (1) examining the ability of nine educational, social, and developmental mechanisms to explain the link between EAP and high school math achievement gains and the chances of 4-year college attendance and (2) examining the ability of family income to moderate the influence of these mechanisms. Results suggest that educational expectations, noncognitive skills, and social capital in the form of communication among parental groups are meaningful mediators, regardless of family income. These findings extend the literature concerned with understanding how EAP is related to academic outcomes, a connection that is not necessarily intuitive.",

During this year-long study, I shadowed eight ninth graders identified as struggling readers across content classes. Data sources included 425 hours of observations, 64 interviews, assessments, and school records and artifacts. Analysis showed that participants' interactions with interrelated institutional contexts for reading intervention and school discipline tended to position students as deficient readers and deviant youths regardless, sometimes, of engaged, skillful reading.

Participants were 483 students (55% male; 33% Euro-American, 25% African American, and 39% Latino). Propensity score weighting controlled for potential confounders in all analyses. Delayed (Grade 8 only) and continuous participation (Grades 7 and 8) in sports predicted competence beliefs and valuing education; delayed and continuous participation in performance arts/clubs predicted teacher-rated engagement and letter grades. Benefits of participation were similar across gender and ethnicity; however, Latino youth were least likely to participate in extracurricular activities. Implications for reducing ethnic and income disparities in educational attainment are discussed.",

Using factor analysis, we construct measures of four distinct dimensions of school climate captured on the annual NYC School Survey. We identify credible estimates by isolating variation in organizational contexts within schools over time. We find that improvements in school leadership especially, as well as in academic expectations, teacher relationships, and school safety are all independently associated with corresponding reductions in teacher turnover. Increases in school safety and academic expectations also correspond with student achievement gains. These results are robust to a range of threats to validity suggesting that our findings are consistent with an underlying causal relationship.",

In this study, we examine one commonly cited mechanism, the top dog/bottom dog phenomenon, which states that students at the top of a grade span (&quot;top dogs&quot;) have better experiences than those at the bottom (&quot;bottom dogs&quot;). Using an instrumental variables strategy introduced in Rockoff and Lockwood (2010) and a longitudinal data set containing student survey data for New York City public middle school students, we estimate the impact of top dog and bottom dog status on bullying, safety, belonging, and academic achievement. This article provides the first credibly causal evidence that top dog status improves the learning environment and academic achievement. We further find that the top dog effect is strongest in sixth grade and in schools with longer grade spans and that the top dog effect is not explained by new students to a school or student height.",

However, prior research on SIG effectiveness is limited and focuses primarily on student achievement. This study uses a difference-in-differences strategy to estimate program impacts on multiple dimensions across the 3-year duration of the SIG award in one urban school district. Following 2 years of modest improvement, we find pronounced, positive effects of SIG interventions on student achievement in Year 3, consistent with prior literature indicating that improvements from comprehensive school turnarounds emerge gradually. We also identify improvements indicating the process through which change occurred, including reduced unexcused absences, increased family preference for SIG schools, improved retention of effective teachers, and greater development of teacher professional capacity.",

Drawing on examples from the founding of public schools to the present, we find that successful system-wide reforms addressed problems that teachers thought they had by being consistent with prevailing norms and values, mobilizing a significant public constituency, and building the needed educational infrastructure. We distinguish between system-wide and niche reforms, suggesting that some--particularly those seeking ambitious instruction--failed system-wide but succeeded by creating protected educational niches.

Path analysis indicated that strategic meaning making coordinated with self-monitoring and source evaluation positively influenced the quality of the generated questions, whereas information-locating strategies alone contributed little to the participants' question generation. Further, source evaluation played a positive role when readers monitored and regulated their strategies for information location and meaning making.

Yet, very little research has investigated whether charter schools are safer than traditional public schools. This study compares charter and traditional public schools in Detroit, Michigan, on perceived school safety by linking student surveys to data on school, neighborhood, and parent-related characteristics. Charter schools exhibited higher perceived school safety than traditional public schools. However, controls for student commute distance and parental involvement largely diminished this difference. Neighborhood charter schools were an exception, maintaining higher perceived school safety net of controls. Overall results suggest that differences in perceived school safety between schools become less prominent after the attributes of school choosers are considered.",

Some districts are trying to maintain voluntarily adopted integration policies despite the Supreme Court's recent 2007 decision in &quot;Parents Involved,&quot; which prohibited most race-conscious school choice policies that were effective and popular ways of accomplishing integration. While alternative policies with minimal or no use of race are still permitted, it is unclear whether they will create diverse schools. This research examines the new generation of school choice policies post-&quot;Parents Involved&quot; to understand how they affect diversity in our multiracial yet increasingly race-neutral era. Analysis of the use of a new generalized, race-conscious SAP in Jefferson County (Kentucky) Public Schools suggests that their plan is largely able to maintain integrated schools, albeit with some increasing racial segregation; economic segregation patterns are mixed. Moreover, the controlled choice policy has lower segregation than simulated, non--integration focused policy alternatives.",

        "description":"Our nation's classrooms have become increasingly racially and ethnically diverse. Given these demographic changes, many policymakers and practitioners have expressed the need for increased attention to how teacher diversity might be linked to reducing racial/ethnic differences in teachers' ratings of social-emotional skills for students of color. Using the most recent nationally representative data, we investigated whether kindergarteners have different social-emotional ratings when they had a teacher whose racial/ethnic group was the same as their own. We found that having a teacher of the same race was unrelated to teachers' ratings of children's internalizing problem behaviors, interpersonal skills, approaches to learning, and self-control. However, students whose teachers' race/ethnicity matched their own had more favorable ratings of externalizing behaviors. Results are discussed in terms of implications for school disciplinary policies.",

        "description":"Effectively educating the large English learner population requires policymakers to ensure developmentally appropriate settings and services throughout the time students are learning English, as well as during their transition to fluent English proficient status--a process termed &quot;reclassification.&quot; Using longitudinal student-level data from two U.S. states (N = 107,549), the authors implemented recent advances in multi-site regression discontinuity designs to assess the effects of reclassification policies across districts. They found that reclassification decisions are heavily influenced by state criteria; however, there is considerable variability across districts in the extent of state-level influence. The authors also found robust evidence of between-district heterogeneity in the effects of reclassification on subsequent achievement and graduation. They discuss the implications of these findings for reclassification policies and future research on the topic. Looking toward the next century of education research, the authors discuss ways that multi-site regression discontinuity designs can be combined with qualitative research to enable policymakers and practitioners to better understand variation in effects of policies across contexts as well as the mechanisms underlying those effects.",

Our findings from research conducted in Hawai'i indicate that learners thrive with culture-based education (CBE), especially Indigenous students who experience positive socioemotional and other outcomes when teachers are high CBE users and when learning in high-CBE school environments. Educational progress will come from forward-oriented research and leadership that embraces the cultural advantages of students with diverse experiences of racism, poverty, cultural trauma, and oppression. By cultivating culturally vibrant and affirming learning environments in lieu of &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; approaches, educators honor assets found in Indigenous knowledge, values, and stories as models of vitality and empowerment for all.",

Guided by the extant literature on organizational identity, culture, and institutionalism and using an in-depth case study of a federally designated, four-year HSI, this study focused on the way members construct an organizational identity for serving Latinxs. Findings suggest that while members constructed an ideal Latinx-serving identity based on legitimized outcomes (i.e., graduation), they constructed their current identity from environmental cues about cultural practices. Using two theoretical lenses, I present a typology that considers outcomes and culture in a Latinx-serving identity. Future research should explore the construction of a Latinx-serving identity in a nuanced way.",

Our overarching aim is to begin to conceptualize a role for neurobiological evidence in educational studies of sociality, emotion, culture, and identity.

Board of Education&quot; in 1954. Even though Mexicans were not referenced in Kansas's school segregation laws, they were seen and treated as a racially distinct group. White parents and civic organizations pushed school officials to establish separate facilities for Mexican children. We argue that the contradictory and enigmatic responses to school segregation from high-ranking U.S. and Mexican government officials pointed to a degree of uncertainty about whether Mexican children could be segregated. That ambiguity, however, did not prevent local school officials from placing Mexican children in separate facilities. As the American Educational Research Association continues to pursue education research that promotes the public good, the segregation and resegregation of Mexican children in the United States must be framed as a critical issue moving forward into the &quot;next 100 years.&quot;",

The Supreme Court's decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) has been lauded for decisively declaring that segregation was unconstitutional, and as such, it reflects the promise of American democratic principles. Yet 62 years after the Supreme Court's decision, a 2016 United States General Accounting Office (GAO) report highlights how school segregation remains woven into the fabric of American public education. The Jefferson County Public Schools' (JCPS) student assignment program that is the focus of Frankenberg's article might be understood as part of the legacy of the Supreme Court's second, less celebrated &quot;Brown&quot; decision (1955). As Frankenberg highlights, the lesson from JCPS is that a controlled choice plan with a generalized use of race can help a district maintain its commitment to desegregation. More importantly, it may also point the way for other districts interested in fostering diversity within their schools as the demographic shift underway in U.S. public schools continues to unfold.

In so doing, I argue that caste education plays a central role in realizing the political and social goals of racial capitalist society for Du Bois. Using Du Bois's caste analytic, I take up and articulate three biopolitical governing strategies of the racial capitalist state/industrial schooling regime. The final section ties Du Bois's caste analytic to recent work in Afro-pessimist thought to look at the charter/choice debate. I argue here that Du Bois's caste analysis, when paired with Afro-pessimist thought, shows how even critical scholarship on charter/choice policies fall short in their reliance on a model democracy and humanism based on antiblackness.",

In an experiment embedded within a nationally representative survey of youth ages 15 to 27 (N = 2,101), youth were asked to judge the accuracy of one of several simulated online posts. Consistent with research on motivated reasoning, youth assessments depended on (a) the alignment of the claim with one's prior policy position and to a lesser extent on (b) whether the post included an inaccurate statement. To consider ways educators might improve judgments of accuracy, we also investigated the influence of political knowledge and exposure to media literacy education. We found that political knowledge did not improve judgments of accuracy but that media literacy education did.",

Particularly, the stereotypes of influential adults may induce students' regulatory foci and subsequently their motivational beliefs. Drawing on expectancy-value theory, this study investigated whether teachers' implicit science-is-male stereotypes predict between-teacher variation in males' and females' motivational beliefs regarding physical science. Results showed that teachers' implicit science-is-male stereotypes are positively related with males' self-concept and intrinsic value but negatively associated with females' motivational beliefs. The findings of this study corroborate the notion that teachers' implicit stereotypes can contribute to gender differences in motivational beliefs and probably also to gendered educational choices.",

The bifactor-ESEM solution provided the best fit, suggesting the presence of both sources of construct-relevant psychometric multidimensionality. The results supported measurement invariance of the SPPC across gender and grade level and showed latent mean differences mostly supporting results from previous research.",

We estimate the causal effects of an ethnic studies curriculum, using a &quot;fuzzy&quot; regression discontinuity design based on the fact that several schools assigned students with eighth-grade GPAs below a threshold to take the course. Assignment to this course increased ninth-grade attendance by 21 percentage points, GPA by 1.4 grade points, and credits earned by 23. These surprisingly large effects suggest that CRP, when implemented in a high-fidelity context, can provide effective support to at-risk students.",

Some translanguaging scholars have questioned the existence of discrete languages, further concluding that multilingualism does not exist. I argue that the political use of language names can and should be distinguished from the social and structural idealizations used to study linguistic diversity, favoring what I call an integrated multilingual model of individual bilingualism, contrasted with the unitary model and dual competence model. I further distinguish grammars from linguistic repertoires, arguing that bilinguals, like monolinguals, have a single linguistic repertoire but a richly diverse mental grammar.

We merge teacher performance evaluations from the new system with data from post-evaluation teacher surveys to examine the effects of the differentiated ratings on job satisfaction for teachers. Using a regression-discontinuity design, we show that higher ratings under the new system causally improve teachers' perceptions of work relative to lower ratings.

By tracing the nine-year reform journeys of four primary schools in Hong Kong (using multiyear interview, observational, and archival data), this study uncovers the micro-processes the schools experienced during their reform. New practices first took root in a group of pilot teachers before gradually disseminating to other teachers and eventually transforming the entire school. Challenges differed across the reform journey. Synergy between school leadership, external support, and organization redesign was critical for initial success. Continued progress depended on whether school leaders and external partners could adapt their roles and redesign the organization to address the school's changing capacity and needs. The study reveals the long-term process of school reform and has crucial implications for policy, research, and practice.",

Outcomes varied by NTSP region, cohort, and dosage, with positive performance and retention results for teachers in the region and cohort with the most intensive participation and teachers receiving more coaching. These findings contribute to efforts to develop and retain teachers.",

By extensive analyses of topics, methodology, and citations the research clarifies the global and local forces at work within and across countries, including the types of internationalization occurring between the United States and People's Republic of China. The findings suggest that globalization involves forces in transaction with one another--local forces addressing national interests and international forces seeking a comparative perspective primarily tied to local interests.

The current study uses multilevel propensity score matching analyses to explore whether racial/cultural awareness workshops during college are associated with a variety of civic outcomes six years after graduation. Using a 10-year longitudinal sample of 8,634 alumni from 229 institutions, diversity workshop participation is significantly and positively related to 10 post-college behaviors, attitudes/beliefs, and skills/tendencies. Moreover, these effects are consistent regardless of participants' race/ethnicity, gender, and institutional affiliation.",

This has pushed college readiness issues to the forefront in efforts to increase educational attainment. Little is known about how college readiness improves outcomes for students traditionally marginalized in educational settings or if social background factors continue to impact students in the same way during college regardless of readiness. Examining first-year college retention using a nationally representative data set, this study asks if social background factors and financial resources for college differentially impact students based on readiness. Findings indicate that academic readiness matters and that parental income and college generation status differentially affect first-year college retention for less-ready students but not college-ready students. Students who begin college less prepared academically are also more disadvantaged than college-ready students by the funding sources they have for college.

Schools were chosen for their hyper-diverse student populations. Students came from over 40 countries, speaking 20 languages in one school and 33 languages in another. Results of analysis found that despite contrasting missions, policies, organizational structures, curricular techniques, and teachers' beliefs and attitudes across schools, youths' practices were similar. Youth enacted explicit transcultural repertoires of practice: multiplicities of talking, thinking, and acting that engaged the resources and opportunities of ethnically and linguistically diverse classrooms. The article theorizes the importance of recognizing hyper-diversity as a distinct cultural context that shapes and situates youths' practices and therefore their opportunities to learn.",

Widespread arguments against the proposed change emphasized the identification of highly successful students as &quot;worthy&quot; and others as &quot;unworthy&quot; of resources. Through an analysis of print and digital public texts, we identify a narrative cycle that informed public debate: (a) colorblind rhetoric, (b) academic performance is presumed to emerge solely from talent and effort, so (c) academic performance then becomes a measure of worth, and finally, (d) efforts to address racial disparities are &quot;unfair.&quot; We argue that narratives identifying some students as worthy and others unworthy are highly influential in the outcomes of many educational policy and funding debates.",

This article extends this line of research, using a comparative case study of three high-poverty urban schools to examine the nature of teachers' collaborative work around the Common Core State Standards and the conditions that support this work. It argues that collaborative practices that encourage joint examination of instruction and student learning against standards support teachers in noticing and attending to differences between their current practice and standards. In addition, it examines the role of teachers' instructional knowledge and principals' leadership in supporting teachers' collaboration around standards.",

Following 10 years of data from a large urban school district in California, I identify two predominant characteristics of EL access to content: leveled tracking in which ELs are overrepresented in lower level classes and underrepresented in upper level classes and exclusionary tracking in which ELs are excluded from core academic content area classes, particularly English language arts. Using regression analysis and two regression discontinuity designs, I find evidence that ELs' access to content is limited by a constellation of factors, including prior academic achievement, institutional constraints, English proficiency level, and direct effects of EL classification. This study contributes to understanding of the experiences and opportunities of students learning English as well as theory regarding educational tracking.",

Curriculum materials may be among the most important influences on teachers' instruction. As new standards roll out, there is skepticism about the alignment of &quot;Common Core--aligned&quot; curriculum materials to the standards. This analysis is the first to investigate claims of alignment in the context of fourth-grade mathematics using the only widely used alignment tool capable of estimating the alignment of curriculum materials with the standards. The results indicate substantial areas of misalignment; in particular, the textbooks studied systematically overemphasize procedures and memorization relative to the standards, among other weaknesses. The findings challenge publishers' alignment claims and motivate further research on curriculum alignment.",

We used data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial and compared curriculum-embedded formative assessment (17 classes) with a control group (11 classes). Curriculum-embedded formative assessment and classroom process quality promoted students' learning. Moreover, classroom process quality and embedded formative assessment interacted in promoting student learning. To ensure effective instruction and consequently satisfactory learning outcomes, teachers need to combine specific teaching practices with high classroom process quality.",

We found that the two higher performing high schools in the study had strong and deliberate structures, programs, and practices that attended to both students' academic and social learning needs, something we call &quot;Personalization for Academic and Social Emotional Learning&quot;.

Drawing on concepts from economic sociology, I study principals' competitive networks and the sets of schools they view as rivals, and I use network and statistical analysis to explore factors that explain the existence of a competitive tie between two schools. Most school leaders perceived some competition, but the extent to which they competed with other schools varied significantly. Factors that predicted a competitive relationship between two schools included geography, student transfers, school performance, principal characteristics, and charter network.",

        "description":"The value and effectiveness of formative assessment in the classroom has gained an increasing amount of attention during the past decade, especially since the publication of seminal work by Black and Wiliam titled &quot;Assessment and Classroom Learning.&quot; Since that time, there has been a renewed interest in describing and evaluating teacher practices related to formative assessment. Based on evidence of its effectiveness in the classroom and on improving standardized test scores, many prominent educational entities have initiated reform efforts to promote the use of formative assessment, yet these practices have not been embraced by classroom teachers. This case study investigated internally constructed and externally imposed contextual elements that constrained or facilitated the use of formative assessment by three high school science teachers. Cornett's curriculum development model of personal practice theories was modified to include assessment, termed &quot;personal practice assessment theories&quot; (PPATs), and chosen as a framework for the study. This research revealed distinct differences among the three teachers' PPATs and several different factors that constrained or facilitated the use of formative assessment in their instruction. Most notable of these factors were the forms of teacher knowledge that played a critical role in shaping their assessment practices and had a bearing on their ability to convert espoused theories about assessment into actual classroom practice. Other externally imposed barriers that constrained the use of formative assessment included expectations, habits, and dispositions of students; the pressure that teachers felt to &quot;cover&quot; all of the curriculum in order to prepare students for the end-of-year, high-stakes exam; and an instructivist rather than constructivist approach to teaching and learning. Results from this study add to the growing body of knowledge about the complex terrain teachers negotiate in making teaching and assessment decisions and provides a framework for future studies.",

In addition, numerous gaps remain in the research literature, particularly concerning predictors of retention and achievement. In this study, we used survival analysis to examine the degree to which student characteristics, relevance, prior experience with MOOCs, self-reported commitment, and learners' implicit theory of intelligence predicted retention and achievement. We found that learners' expected investment, including level of commitment, expected number of hours devoted to the MOOC, and intention to obtain a certificate, related to retention likelihood. Prior level of schooling and expected hours devoted to the MOOC predicted achievement.",

Specifically, the intervention was two years of research-based, multidisciplinary curriculum materials for science supported by comprehensive professional development for teachers that focused on those materials. A modest positive effect was detected when comparing outcomes from this intervention to those of business-as-usual materials and professional development. However, this effect was typical for interventions at this grade span that are tested using a state achievement test. Tests of mediation suggest a large treatment effect on teachers and in turn a strong effect of teacher practice on student achievement--reinforcing the hypothesized key role of teacher practice. Tests of moderation indicate no significant treatment by demographic interactions.",

High amounts of procedural math instruction were associated with higher calculation and conceptual math skills. Children's conceptual math skills were also positively associated with high amounts of science instruction. Income × instruction interactions were nonsignificant, but maternal education × math instruction interactions revealed narrower disparities in calculation skills when children were exposed to greater amounts of time in procedural and conceptual math instruction. Overall, the findings indicate that instructional influences on early math learning operate similarly for low and high SES children.",

Our findings show that beyond contributing to declines in student body diversity, laws like Proposal 2 have negatively influenced work critical to the success of students of color on campus. The findings suggest institutions operating in an anti-affirmative action context would benefit from proactive policies and practices that empower administrators in legally restrictive environments and support conversation and action that directly address the ways race continues to matter on college campuses.",

Drawing on sensemaking and attribution theory and data collected in six middle schools, we find that while teachers most often attributed outcomes to their own instruction, they also frequently focused on supposedly stable student characteristics. By citing these characteristics as explanations for the results analyzed, teachers may have inhibited reflection on their practice and reinforced low expectations for English language learners (ELLs) and students in special education. These findings yield implications for (a) the effectiveness of data use reforms and (b) equity in the education of ELLs and students in special education.",

        "description":"Many U.S. public school systems now face three large demographic shifts: rising poverty, the growing number of students from immigrant families, and increasing populations of students of color. Yet, we know little about how district policymakers react to these important changes or indeed the factors that consistently shape their policymaking. Drawing on interpretative policy analysis, the politics of education, and in-depth interviews with 37 school board members, superintendents, and district administrators across two school districts, I argue that racial meaning emerged as central in both districts' policymaking processes as political and organizational contexts interacted to shape district leaders' meaning-making and policy responses. Yet, leaders' meaning-making and policy responses obscured systematic inequalities in students' lives, including those stemming from race, immigration, and poverty. I conclude with implications of this analysis for understanding school district policymaking and how to improve schooling for students of color, students in poverty, and immigrant students.",

Drawing on in-depth interviews and focus group data, participants discussed the importance of mentoring across the life course, the ideal attributes of mentoring relationships, the challenges to effective mentoring, and the role of political guidance. These data elicited three main themes regarding mentoring: (a) Life course practices geared toward accumulating social capital are critical, (b) major barriers are linked to the undervaluing of faculty research areas and community-engaged scholarly commitments, and (c) connections with mentors who understand the struggles specific to URMs at predominantly White institutions (PWIs) can assist with retention and success.

The simple idea that the child rather than the teacher or textbook should be the major focus of the classroom is, perhaps, the single most enduring educational idea of the era. In this historical study, the author argues that child-centered education emerged directly from the theory of recapitulation, the idea that the development of the White child retraced the history of the human race. The theory of recapitulation was pervasive in the fields of anthropology, sociology, and psychology at the turn of the 20th century, and so early progressive educators uncritically adopted the basic tenets of the theory, which served as a major rationale for child-centered instruction. The theory was inherently ethnocentric and racist because it pointed to the West as the developmental endpoint of history, thereby depicting people of color as ontologically less developed than their White counterparts.",

Prior research has revealed that the selection and use of cognitively demanding tasks does not guarantee high-level student thinking during their enactment. To address this challenge, we designed and implemented a professional development (PD) in which participants analyzed video clips of the enactment of cognitively demanding science tasks. Using transcripts of pre-and post-PD interviews during which participants were asked to respond to specially selected video clips, we analyzed what the participants attended to and how they made sense of what they saw.

This mixed-method study investigates agreement between student mentees' and their faculty mentors' perceptions of the students' developing research knowledge and skills in STEM. We also compare both assessments against independent ratings of the students' written research proposals. In most cases, students and their mentors identified divergent strengths and weaknesses. However, when mentor-mentee pairs did identify the same characteristics, mentors and mentees disagreed about the mentee's abilities in 44% of cases in the Fall semester and 75% of cases in the Spring semester. When compared against performance-based assessments of mentees' work, neither faculty mentors' nor their mentees' perceptions aligned with rubric scores at rates greater than chance in most categories.",

        "description":"Research has demonstrated that instruction that relies heavily on studying worked examples is more effective for less experienced learners compared to instruction emphasizing problem solving. However, the guidance associated with studying some worked examples may reduce the performance of more experienced learners. This study investigated categories of guidance using geometry worked examples. Three conditions were used. In the theorem and step guidance condition, students were provided with the solution steps required to reach the answer and the theorems used to justify the steps. In the step guidance condition, learners were only provided with the sequence of steps needed to reach the answer but not with the theorems explaining the steps. The problem-solving condition required learners to solve problems without any guidance. It was hypothesized that for students who had already learned the relevant theorems, the major task was to learn to recognize problem states and their associated solution moves. The step guidance condition should best facilitate such knowledge, compared to a problem-solving or a theorem and step guidance approach. For students who had not yet fully learned the theorems, the theorem and step guidance approach should be superior. Two geometry instruction experiments supported these hypotheses. Information concerning theorems should only be provided if students have yet to learn and automate theorem schemas.",

Despite similarities in their contexts, the workgroups invoked different data use logics that shaped teachers' learning opportunities. The first workgroup's instructional management logic linked increasing student achievement to individualization. The second workgroup's instructional improvement logic focused on students' thinking and linked it to instructional changes but was limited by broader instructional management logics.

Transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory followed by thematic coding. Discussions of loss were markedly proximal to discussions of children's education. Schooling was described as providing upward mobility but conflicting with education at home, which was seen as fostering traditional values. Discussion contextualizes findings using Hobfoll's conservation of resources theory and Kagitçibasi's family change theory.

Theoretically, this research extends the &quot;contexts of reception&quot; framework from immigration studies into the educational realm by investigating how teachers--as one important contextual variable--entered into settings designed for immigrant-origin ELs. Analysis examined institutional processes, norms, and policies as well as participants' practices. Findings suggest that novice teachers were most likely to be placed into separate EL content-area classrooms, unless more senior teachers requested these assignments or administrators intervened. Ultimately, this article uses teacher assignment processes to illustrate how contexts for immigrant-origin youth are constructed and contested and how ELs' opportunities to learn were jeopardized in local settings.",

This led to higher test scores for students with both above- and below-average skills, yet failure rates increased for above-average students. We examine the mechanisms behind these surprising results. Sorting by incoming skills benefitted the test scores of high-skill students partially through higher demands and fewer disruptive peers. But more students failed because their skills were low relative to classroom peers. For below-average students, improvements in pedagogy and more time for learning offset problems associated with low-skill classrooms. In some cases, classrooms were not sorted, but below-average students took an extra support class simultaneously. Test scores also improved in such classes.

Analyzing a longitudinal sample of 4,152 aspiring STEM majors who completed the 2004 Freshman Survey and 2008 College Senior Survey, this study utilizes multinomial hierarchical generalized linear modeling and propensity score matching techniques to examine how participation in undergraduate research affects STEM students&apos; intentions to enroll in STEM and non-STEM graduate and professional programs. Findings indicate that participation in an undergraduate research program significantly improved students&apos; probability of indicating plans to enroll in a STEM graduate program.

        "description":"Using data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, this study examines the association between high school socioeconomic segregation and student attainment outcomes and the mechanisms that mediate those relationships. The results show that socioeconomic segregation has a strong association with high school graduation and college enrollment. Controlling for an array of student and school factors, students who attend high socioeconomic composition (SEC) schools are 68% more likely to enroll at a 4-year college than students who attend low SEC schools. Two mediating mechanisms were examined, including socioeconomic-based peer influences and school effects. The results indicate the association between SEC and attainment is due more to peer influences, which tend to be negative in the low SEC setting. However, school practices that emphasize academics also play a major role, particularly in mediating the relationship between SEC and 4-year college enrollment. These findings suggest that integrating schools is likely necessary to fully addressing the negative consequences of attending a low SEC school. (Contains 18 notes, 5 figures, and 3 tables.)",

The purposes of this study were to identify grade-schoolers' collaborative skills, evaluate the importance of identified skills for collaborative work, and determine whether differences in skill use were related to children's social and scholastic competence. Initially, third through fifth graders (&quot;N&quot; = 113) described attributes of &quot;good&quot; collaborators, and these attributes were distilled into distinct skill categories or &quot;types.&quot; Next, third through fifth graders (&quot;N&quot; = 212) rated exemplars of each skill type as a basis for skill importance and peers' skill use and provided data that were used to construct measures of work partner preference and peer acceptance. Teachers reported on participants' achievement in multiple academic domains. Four categories of work-related and interpersonal skills were identified, and these skill types were differentially associated with children's work partner preferences, peer acceptance, and achievement. Overall, the findings help to specify the types of skills grade-schoolers need to relate effectively with classmates in the context of collaborative academic tasks.",

This pattern indicates that after controlling for socioeconomic and academic characteristics, Black students are more likely to continue education than are their White counterparts.

Results indicate that a net Black advantage exists from high school entry through postsecondary enrollment and that student expectations and parental aspirations partially explain the net Black advantage. These findings call into question selection explanations of the net Black advantage, underscore the role of socioeconomic disparities for educational stratification, and highlight the utility of an educational careers approach for understanding how race structures educational attainment.",

Assessment instruments based on the National Science Education Standards with 20 items in common were administered several times during the school year to both students and their teachers. For items that had a very popular wrong answer, the teachers who could identify this misconception had larger classroom gains, much larger than if the teachers knew only the correct answer. On items on which students did not exhibit misconceptions, teacher subject matter knowledge alone accounted for higher student gains. This finding suggests that a teacher&apos;s ability to identify students&apos; most common wrong answer on multiple-choice items, a form of pedagogical content knowledge, is an additional measure of science teacher competence.",

We estimate SES provider effects on students' math and reading achievement in an urban school district that accounts for a significant share of participating students.

After controlling for individual and track mean achievement, results indicated that generally for students in course-by-course tracking, high-track students had higher mathematics self-concepts and low-track students had lower mathematics self-concepts. For students in between-school and within-school streaming, the reverse pattern was found.

While evidence of the impact of the project on teachers' practice and the associated gains made by Maori students has been published previously, in order for the work of &quot;Te Kotahitanga&quot; to contribute to the broader educational research community, its pedagogical premises require empirical verification. To do so, we must first establish the validity of the pedagogical data by addressing two questions: (a) To what degree can the data gathered in the collaborative processes of &quot;Te Kotahitanga&quot; be used as a measure of pedagogical quality? and (b) Do these data support the foundational hypothesis of the project, that &quot;extended family&quot; relationships, as understood by Maori people when using the Maori term, &quot;whanaungatanga,&quot; are a central necessary component of overall pedagogical quality? This article provides an account of the context of this work then presents an analysis directed to these questions in turn. First, our analysis of the observational data gathered during the &quot;Te Kotahitanga&quot; professional development process is presented, followed by the measures that were developed for each of the main dimensions of pedagogy addressed in this work. Second, using these measures we present our analysis of the inter-relation among these dimensions of pedagogy to test the &quot;Whanaungatanga&quot; pedagogical thesis.",

We characterized instructors' teaching approaches as traditional, meaning-making, or student-support and classified framing talk and mathematical questioning in the classroom. We found an association between instructors' descriptions of their approaches to teaching and their enactment in the classroom through framing talk but no association between these approaches and instructors' use of novel mathematical questions. Categorizations of teaching approaches that include classroom data to describe the interactions between students, content, and instruction can provide actionable information to influence teaching practice in higher education.",

It draws on the work of scholars who have theorized &quot;critical&quot; essentialism to suggest that Hmong leaders are critically aware of the role and import of dominant culture in shaping the contours of Hmong children&apos;s education. The analysis brings attention to &quot;culture consciousness&quot;--a lens for analyzing immigrant education that highlights the deployment of culture as social critique and political strategy. This research complicates the essentialist versus anti-essentialist binary for analyzing culture and disrupts the tendency to portray immigrant parents and adults as entrenched in a reified culture.",

Quantitative analysis of thirty schools suggests that teacher value-added measures and informal principal evaluations are positively, but weakly, correlated. Qualitative analysis suggests that some principals give high value-added teachers low ratings because the teachers exert too little effort and are &quot;lone wolves&quot; who work in isolation and contribute little to the school community. The results suggest that the method of evaluation may not only affect which specific teachers are rewarded in the short term, but shape the qualities of teacher and teaching students experience in the long term.",

We find substantial variation in the number of applicants per school, ranging from under five to over 300. Schools serving more advantaged students have more applicants per vacancy, on average, and teacher preferences vary systematically by their own demographic characteristics.

Results suggest that choosing a STEM major is directly influenced by intent to major in STEM, high school math achievement, and initial postsecondary experiences, such as academic interaction and financial aid receipt. Exerting the largest impact on STEM entrance, intent to major in STEM is directly affected by 12th-grade math achievement, exposure to math and science courses, and math self-efficacy beliefs--all three subject to the influence of early achievement in and attitudes toward math. Multiple-group structural equation modeling analyses indicated heterogeneous effects of math achievement and exposure to math and science across racial groups, with their positive impact on STEM intent accruing most to White students and least to underrepresented minority students.",

Specifically, we explicate Caruth&apos;s metaphor of the speaking wound, in conversation with other trauma studies scholarship, to consider the representations of lived experiences carried into classrooms and the consequences of interpreting and representing students&apos; lives. To provide context for our conceptual argument, we discuss qualitative data of two students&apos; experiences across a school year. We argue that trauma theory illuminates two overlapping, yet distinguishable, ways trauma can be productively conceptualized in schools and marshaled as a context for analyzing structural inequities: first, to consider the trauma individuals carry into classrooms as a potential source for deepening students&apos; connections to school; second, to recognize how some students&apos; positioning within the institution of public schooling in the United States constitutes a trauma that must be heard and proactively addressed. In both conceptualizations, we argue for inserting trauma theory into conversations about the moral and pedagogical imperative to work toward increased equity in schools and classrooms.",

Multilevel regression analyses reveal that connective instruction predicts engagement more than seven times as strongly as academic rigor or lively teaching. Embedded case studies of five classes use interviews and observations to examine how various classes combine connective instruction, academic rigor, and lively teaching and how these practices individually and collectively engage students.

        "description":"Intermediary organizations increasingly provide support for schools serving marginalized students. Some attribute this trend to growing ideological support for market-based strategies to further the public good. This article investigates one intermediary that marketed equity-oriented instructional goals for schools serving high numbers of students of color and English Learners. Drawing on critical policy studies and political science, we analyze its behavior amid a high-stakes accountability environment, its reasons for adopting certain reforms, and the consequences for instruction. We use qualitative comparative analysis to show how policy forces shaped reforms and content in its schools, but not pedagogy specific to students of color or English Learners. We discuss the implications for the research on intermediaries and the democratic control of public education.",

I employed discrete-time survival analysis to estimate the average time to and grade of reclassification with and without controlling for socioeconomic status and home language. The average EL exited 3 years after school entry or in second grade; however, the odds that a non-Spanish-speaking EL was reclassified were nearly twice that of their Spanish-speaking EL classmates after controlling for income. Despite reclassification in the early elementary grades, large percentages of the kindergarten cohort experienced later academic difficulties and 22% of the sample was retained in grade.",

Some of this scholarship has suggested that rural schools and educators may be complicit in this process as they devote extra attention and resources to the highest achieving students--those most likely to leave their rural communities after high school. Using data from a national multimethod study, we find mixed support for this hypothesis. To the contrary, our data suggest that the highest-achieving rural students are among those with the greatest community attachment, and that student perceptions of local economic conditions are far more influential in shaping postsecondary residential aspirations than the advice of educators, or the poverty level of the school.",

Work was conducted in the context of a randomized controlled trial. Participants were 88 third-grade teachers and their 1,533 students. A multigroup path analysis accounting for fidelity of implementation revealed no direct or indirect effects linking MKT to student achievement in the RC or control condition. The same analysis revealed different findings for the RC versus control teachers. In the RC group only: (a) Teachers trained in RC who used more RC practices showed higher use of standards-based mathematics teaching practices, and (b) higher use of standards-based mathematics teaching practices related to greater improvements in math achievement. No comparable findings were evident in the control condition. Results demonstrate the importance of building social and emotional capacity in teachers by helping create a supportive classroom that helps teachers provide stronger mathematics teaching practices that lead to improved student learning.",

        "author":["Mickelson, Roslyn Arlin"],
        "description":"Middle schools are important because they launch students on trajectories that they are likely to follow throughout their formal educations. This study explored the relationship of first-generation segregation (elementary and middle school racial composition) and second-generation segregation (racially correlated academic tracks) to reading and mathematics test scores of Grade 8 students who attended the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) in 1997. At the time the data were collected, the district had been operating under a mandatory desegregation plan since the early 1970s, which it continued to do for another five years. While the majority of students attended desegregated schools for most of their CMS education, a portion of youth also experienced school- and classroom-level segregation. Survey data collected from 1,812 students in randomly selected language arts classes stratified by track from the district's 24 middle schools were analyzed with multilevel modeling to examine the influence of school and classroom racial composition on standardized scores, controlling for student and family factors associated with school performance. Results indicate that school- and classroom-level racial segregation was negatively related to achievement. Beginning in elementary school, sequential experiences of first- and second-generation segregation likely triggered a cycle of cumulative disadvantage for respondents' middle school educational outcomes. This article contributes to the literatures on the structural antecedents of school success and failure, the ways that many positive desegregation effects are undermined by tracking, and how first- and second-generation segregation contributes to maintaining the race gap in school outcomes.",

        "description":"Publicly funded single-sex schooling (SSS) has proliferated in recent years and is touted as a remedy to gaps in academic attitudes and achievement, particularly for low-income students of color. Research on SSS is rife with limitations, stemming from selective admissions processes, selection effects related to socioeconomic status, a lack of ethnic diversity among students, and a neglect of boys' schools. Addressing those concerns, the current study is a quasi-experimental investigation of the academic attitudes and achievement among 11th-grade low-income students of color enrolled in nonselective, urban neighborhood public single-sex and mixed-sex high schools. Students in SSS reported significantly more negative attitudes about English/reading compared to students in mixed-sex schools (MSS), while there were no differences in math or science attitudes. Data from standardized tests indicate that SSS was associated with poorer achievement among boys in reading and math but higher achievement among girls on math, science, reading, and writing.",

The current analyses use administrative data from TUSD (2008-2011), running logistic regression models to assess the relationship between taking MAS classes and passing AIMS (Arizona state standardized tests) and high school graduation.

        "description":"Over a hundred years ago, John Dewey delivered his now-well-known address &quot;Science as Subject-Matter and as Method&quot; to those assembled at the Boston meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in which he lamented the nearly exclusive focus on content knowledge in early-20th-century school science classrooms. This article revisits Dewey&apos;s talk and examines the development of science education in the United States in the years since that address. Dewey&apos;s critique of science education in 1909 provides fertile ground for a renewed critique of science education practices today. It is argued that there is, specifically, a need to recover the rapidly fading civic aims of science teaching, which requires greater attention to the methods of science--the idea Dewey highlighted so strongly back then.",

The 20-week classroom-based intervention improved students' vocabulary knowledge, morphological awareness skills, and comprehension of expository texts that included academic words taught, as well as their performance on a standardized measure of written language skills.

Teachers discussed four principles of motivation and related instructional strategies. Teachers enacted instructional strategies in their classrooms. We observed six randomly selected teachers and their students over 3 years. Analyses of the dynamic patterns of teacher-student interaction (using an application of state space grids) revealed two distinct patterns. The upward group (n = 3) showed an increase of teacher motivational support and student engagement. The stable group (n = 3) demonstrated low levels of both teacher motivational support and student engagement. Qualitative analyses of instructional differences between the two groups help explain student engagement. Implications include conceptualizing student engagement as interpersonal classroom activity and measuring change as developmental and dynamic phenomena.",

Drawing on theories of play and data from a two-year case study that included classroom observations, interviews, artifact collection, and surveys, the author examines the ways in which elements of play were present across the practice of eight novice middle grades teachers. Building on examples of play in these classrooms, the author proposes adding the dimension of play to frameworks of middle grades teaching--a dimension that encompasses young adolescents' engagement in classroom work that involves choice and self-direction, imaginative creations, and a nonstressed state of interest and joy.",

I estimate the effect of gerrymandering on school diversity and school district segregation by comparing the racial/ethnic characteristics of existing attendance zones to those of counterfactual zones expected in the absence of gerrymandering. Results indicate that the gerrymandering of attendance zones generally exacerbates segregation, although it has a weaker effect on the segregation of Whites from Blacks and Hispanics. Gerrymandering is particularly segregative in districts experiencing rapid racial/ethnic change. However, gerrymandering is associated with reductions in segregation in a substantial minority of districts, notably those under desegregation orders.",

A subsample of 2,002 students (30% boarding students; 70% day students) had pretest data, enabling analyses of gains or declines in outcomes across the school year. Results indicated predominant parity between boarding and day students on most outcome factors, some modest positive results favoring boarding students, and no notable differences in gains or declines on outcomes between boarders and day students over the course of one academic year.

Others report the reverse: an advantage from attending an institution where one's own skills exceed most other students. Using multilevel models and propensity score matching methods to reduce selection bias, we find that selectivity does not have an independent effect on graduation. Instead, we find relatively small positive effects on graduation from attending a college with higher tuition costs.

Using hazard analysis and 12 years of data from a large school district, the study investigates whether reclassification timing, patterns, or barriers differ by linguistic program. We find that Latino EL students enrolled in two-language programs are reclassified at a slower pace in elementary school but have higher overall reclassification, English proficiency, and academic threshold passage by the end of high school.

        "description":"Rendering visible African immigrants' shared and differing experiences of civic learning and action, the authors present findings from in-depth semi-structured interviews with second- and 1.5-generation African immigrants in New York City. Drawing on an interdisciplinary framework of African immigrant identities constructions and civic engagement, we highlight a multilayered view of civic teaching, learning, and action within and across contexts of families, identities, and schooling in the United States, Africa, and globally. In so doing, the research affirms African immigrant youth's racial and ethnic identities toward broadened understandings of civic engagement such as participatory communal citizenship. The findings support the need for teacher educator preparation for immigrant youth and curriculum within secondary schools in a diverse U.S. society.",

Schools (n = 24) were randomized into intervention and control conditions; 2,904 children were studied from end of second to fifth grade. Students at schools assigned to the RC condition did not outperform students at schools assigned to the control condition in math or reading achievement. Use of RC practices mediated the relation between treatment assignment and improved math and reading achievement. Effect sizes (ES) were calculated as standardized coefficients. ES relations between use of RC practices and achievement were 0.26 for math and 0.30 for reading. The RC practices and math achievement relation was greater for students with low initial math achievement (ES = 0.89). Results emphasize fidelity of implementation.",

Children in Mexico were the lowest in phonemic awareness among the three groups and very low in their entering first-grade reading skills. However, they ended second grade matching or surpassing the reading skills of the U.S. students while remaining lower in phonemic awareness.

        "description":"After-school community-based spaces are often recognized in political and educational discourse as institutions that &quot;save&quot; and &quot;rescue&quot; Black youth. Such rhetoric perpetuates an ethos of pathology that diminishes the agency of youth and their communities. Through ethnographic research with 20 youth workers at a college completion and youth development after-school program in the urban Northeast, findings indicate that tensions arise as youth workers strive to reimagine Black youth in humanizing ways despite pressures to frame them as broken and in need of fixing to compete for funding with charter schools. Data also reveal deep tensions in youth workers' experiences as they critique neoliberal reforms that shape their work; yet, at the same time, they are forced to hold students to markers of success defined by neoliberal ideals. These tensions result in youth workers downplaying the social, cultural, and emotional dimensions of their work.",

        "description":"Despite the increased use of video for data collection, most research using assessment interviews in early childhood education relies solely upon the analysis of linguistic data, ignoring children's bodies. This trend is particularly troubling in studies of marginalized children because transcripts limited to language can make it difficult to analyze embodied power relations between majority researchers and minority children. This article responds to this problem by outlining a theoretical position on power and bodies, describing multimodal analysis strategies, and using these strategies to analyze the subject positions available during a mathematical assessment interview for three African American preschool child-participants and the European American adult researcher. This study draws attention to the complexity of human interactions during assessment interviews by describing the ways children positioned themselves as willing (or not), attentive (or not), and competent (or not) as well as describing the ways the researcher sought to position herself.",

I empirically illustrate how this oversimplified criminalization of Mexican immigrant men led to father-child separations, incredible stress for children, and the positioning of children as mediators in high-stakes encounters between the police and their parents. I highlight the need to strip back these masks to address and build upon students' real-world experiences, including their immigration practices and family-based hybrid language practices, for this younger generation of DREAMers and U.S. citizens.",

Type of infraction; race, gender, and to a certain extent socioeconomic status at the individual level; and, at the school level, mean school achievement, percentage Black enrollment, and principal perspectives all contributed to the probability of out-of-school suspension or expulsion. For racial disparities, however, school-level variables, including principal perspectives on discipline, appear to be among the strongest predictors. Such a pattern suggests that schools and districts looking to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in discipline would do well to focus on school-and classroom-based interventions.",

Motivated by the rich but inconclusive literature on the consequences of educational and residential segregation, we make use of a natural policy experiment--a judicial decision to end court-ordered busing--to estimate the causal impacts of this policy shift on household residential decisions. We find that, for those who moved, the legal decision made White families with children in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools substantially more likely than they were during desegregation to move to a neighborhood with a greater proportion of White residents than their own neighborhood.",

The sample included 7,948 kindergarten to fifth-grade students in a large urban district during 1999-2009. School-and student-level treatment effects on report card grades and standardized test scores in elementary through middle school were estimated. Propensity score methods accounted for pre-intervention group differences. City Connects students demonstrated higher report card scores than comparisons and scored higher on middle school English language arts and mathematics tests.

It describes the use of knowledge to notice and interpret significant features of classroom situations. Three aspects of professional vision have been described by qualitative research: describe, explain, and predict classroom situations. We refer to these aspects in order to model professional vision. We developed a video-based instrument to empirically test the model. The results show that our measure to assess aspects of professional vision differentiates between description, explanation, and prediction. The study provides insight into the structure of professional vision, allowing us to conceptualize it theoretically and discuss the targeted use for teaching and formative assessment of preservice teachers.",

After describing the district's infrastructure for elementary EL education, we examine how this infrastructure supported teachers' work practice--the practices in which teachers engage with one another--as operationalized around instructional advice and information networks. Findings reveal that teachers' opportunities to learn about EL instruction varied significantly by the school subject and that these differences were directly related to the way in which the district built its EL educational infrastructure.",

We considered both the nature of the text used and the comprehension tasks asked of students in determining the cognitive demands of the curricula. Contrary to the common assumption of a trend of simplification of the texts and comprehension tasks in third- and sixth-grade curricula, the results indicate that curricular complexity declined early in the century and leveled off over the middle decades but has notably increased since the 1970s, particularly for the third-grade curricula.",

The grants and their local effects provide an opportunity to examine the new politics of diversity in public education. Participants cited a wide range of conceptions of diversity, most of which were race-neutral. Some districts enacted policies deemphasizing their original diversity goals. Even in Technical Assistance for Student Assignment Plans (TASAP) districts, whose leaders presumably value diversity, diversity was not always a compelling goal when competing with priorities such as fiscal austerity, school improvement, and neighborhood school demands. Future federal efforts to increase students' exposure to diverse peers should recognize that local conditions might create contrary political pressures for local policymakers.",

Drawing on sense-making theory and longitudinal qualitative data, we examined how community college students interpret state transfer policies and how their interpretations influence subsequent behavior. Data from 3 years of interviews revealed how students adjudicate between multiple intersecting policies. The higher education context, where institutions provided competing signals about policies, left students to navigate complex messages to achieve their transfer goals. Students' approaches to understanding transfer policies primarily followed one of two patterns: adopting policy signals as step-by-step procedures or adapting and combining policy signals to create a customized transfer pathway. Both approaches had important implications for students' transfer outcomes.",

        "description":"We draw on rich longitudinal data from one of the largest teacher education programs in Texas to examine the properties of rubric-based observational evaluations of preservice teachers (PSTs) during clinical teaching. Using a variance decomposition approach, we find that little of the variation in observation scores is attributable to actual differences between PSTs. Instead, differences in scores largely reflect differences in the rating standards of field supervisors. Men and PSTs of color receive systematically lower scores, as do PSTs in lower-income and rural placement schools. Finally, higher-scoring PSTs are slightly more likely to become employed as K-12 public school teachers and substantially more likely to be hired at the same school as their clinical teaching placement.",

In this study, we examine one hypothesized mechanism: teacher perceptions. Using a national data set (Early Childhood Longitudinal Study--Kindergarten Cohort of 2010-2011 or ECLS-K:2011), we use coarsened exact matching to estimate the effect of kindergarten EL status on teachers' perceptions of students' academic skills. We further explore whether that impact is moderated by instructional setting (bilingual vs. English immersion). We find evidence that EL classification results in lower teacher perceptions. This impact is, however, moderated by bilingual environments. In bilingual classrooms, we do not find evidence that EL classification results in diminished perceptions. This study adds to research on teacher perceptions and the effects of EL classification.",

Our findings reveal that an institution's legal context and administrators' interpretations of law and law-related pressures shape their understanding of hate speech-related incidents, and the permissible responses, in ways that make it nearly impossible to consider and implement inclusion-focused practices.

Despite emerging evidence regarding the effectiveness of articulation agreements to address this challenge, it is unclear if these policies support nonlinear transfer pathways--including lateral transfer between 4-year colleges or reverse transfer to 2-year colleges. I use propensity score weighting to examine a statewide articulation agreement in Ohio that established universal credit acceptance for coursework affecting all transfers. Comparing students who completed universally transferrable courses with those who did not, I find no measurable difference in degree attainment among reverse transfers. But there is a positive association with bachelor's degree attainment among lateral transfers, which the findings suggest is related to academic major persistence.",

        "description":"Wielding degrees of influence within educational organizations, university leaders are critical in determining how institutions enact their espoused missions and support severely marginalized campus communities. How do universities address and improve educational outcomes for the most severely underrepresented communities? This article presents emergent findings from an illustrative multiple-case study that examined the relationships between two public universities and local American Indian nations in California. As a preliminary step in understanding the present state of &quot;tribal-university relationships,&quot; I present findings on university leaders' perceptions and knowledge regarding American Indians broadly and relationships with local Native nations specifically. Using tribal critical race theory as an analytical framework, I posit how colonization, federal recognition, and educational practices affect curricular, political, and economic relationships.",

        "description":"Nationally, 15% of first-time community college students were high school dual enrollment (DE) students, which raises concerns about how high school peers might influence college enrollees. Using administrative data from a large state community college system, we examine whether being exposed to a higher percentage of DE peers in entry-level (gateway) math and English courses influences non-DE enrollees' performance. Using a two-way fixed effects model, our results indicate that college enrollees exposed to a higher proportion of DE peers had lower pass rates and grades in gateway courses, and higher course repetition rates. Supplemental student-level analysis suggests that greater exposure to DE peers during a student's initial semester in college reduces next-term college persistence.",

Drawing on 7 months of ethnographic fieldwork, I found that the school boosted college enrollment through student compliance to the college accountability policies rather than through the transmission of dominant cultural resources. Alignment between a student's worldview and the school's approach mediated their ability to draw on their full range of resources to participate in the college choice process and forge postsecondary trajectories they believed in. These findings foreshadow the potential impacts of &quot;College for All&quot; accountability structures and underscore the importance of cultural congruence in college-going cultures.",

        "description":"A major area of critical scholarship within human rights education (HRE) aims to discover HRE's revolutionary potential by questioning its relationship to the global human rights regime. However, the very concept of &quot;human rights violations&quot; remains underexamined. This article analyzes the use and function of human rights violations as pedagogical devices. Drawing from qualitative data collected in two public high schools in New York City (2014-2015), this study explores the limitations of teaching human rights through the legal definition of human rights violations. In doing so, HRE positions human rights violations primarily as manifestations of direct violence. We argue that to teach human rights violations also as expressions of structural violence can help students cultivate powerful and transformative forms of knowledge.",

Using comparative interrupted time series analysis and difference-in-differences with matching, I find that test-optional policies were associated with a 3% to 4% increase in Pell Grant recipients, a 10% to 12% increase in first-time students from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds, and a 6% to 8% increase in first-time enrollment of women. Overall, I do not detect clear evidence of changes in application volume or yield rate. Subgroup analyses suggest that these patterns were generally similar for both the more selective and the less selective institutions examined.

By 2017, this network developed a &quot;core-periphery&quot; topology.

Through further elaborating the politicized caring framework, our analyses show how Black educators disrupt the racialized harm produced within schools to instead (re)position Black students as children worthy of protection via caring relationships, alternative discipline policies, and other interpersonal and institutional mechanisms.

We find that teachers express a strong preference for two malleable school processes, administrative support and discipline enforcement, along with a higher salary, a structural feature. Estimates indicate these attributes are 2 to 3 times more important to teachers than fixed school characteristics like prior achievement.

Yet dynamics driving these changes are understudied, and there are few comparative studies of system-level governance shifts. To address these gaps, we use extensive qualitative data to analyze change in Los Angeles, Denver, and New Orleans. Drawing on evolutionary theories, we find that external crises, state policy, and new actors triggered change, yet distinct contexts and change processes resulted in markedly different systems. Finally, in all three cities, concerns that emerging systems exacerbated long-standing inequities indicate that governance change is both an organizational and highly contentious political process.",

        "description":"The federal Race to the Top initiative signified a shift in American education policy whereby accountability efforts moved from the school to the teacher level. Using administrative data from Tennessee, we explore whether evaluation reforms differentially influenced mobility patterns for teachers of varying effectiveness. We find that the rollout of a statewide evaluation system, even without punitive consequences, was associated with increased turnover; however, there was comparably greater retention of more effective teachers, with larger differences in turnover between highly and minimally effective teachers confined to urban districts and low-performing schools. These results imply that states and districts can increase exit rates of low-performing instructors in the absence of automatic dismissals, which is a pattern that our analyses suggest may not generalize beyond urban school settings.",

Analyzing longitudinal data, including the social networks of 119 ECTs, we find that ECTs increase their ambitious mathematics instruction when their network members positively interpret accountability pressures and curricular standards as manifest in standardized tests and evaluation. This estimated effect is net of an ECT's rich covariates, including the levels of ambitious mathematics instruction at the beginning of the academic year. It is implied that not all ECTs experience accountability pressures and curricular standards in the same way--their experiences are affected by the immediate networks in which they are embedded.

This qualitative embedded case study examined the curricular access of 10 ELs with disabilities in middle school. Utilizing deficit thinking for its theoretical underpinnings, the analysis illuminated that ELs with disabilities were consistently placed in lower academic tracks through a number of mutually reinforcing institutional and perceptual factors. The findings have exigent implications for expanding opportunities to learn of ELs with disabilities through reform to placement criteria and provision of special education and linguistic support across a range of academic tracks.",

This study uses interview and survey data with elementary school parents in predominantly low-income Latinx communities to examine how parents meet one another; how deeper, more trusting relationships develop; and how the size and quality of parent networks change over time in the presence and absence of a family engagement program. Interview data suggest few and infrequent opportunities for parents to meet one another, which makes building relationships characterized by trust and shared expectations more difficult.

Utilizing a difference-in-differences and event-study design, we investigate the role Tulsa Achieves eligibility plays in promoting or hindering vertical transfer and bachelor's degree attainment across racial/ethnic groups.

        "description":"This critical race ethnography examines a secondary-level dual-language (DL) program, a bilingual-education model thought to provide Latinxs educational equity. Drawing from a three-stage recursive analytic approach, I present evidence that a DL program's policies and practices valued offering Latinx youth biliterate schooling only so long as DL was available and advantageous to Whites--which ultimately excluded some Latinx students from bilingual education and/or accessing its benefits. I theorize DL functions as white property when DL perpetuates racial hierarchies and preserves the value of a white racial identity, thereby maintaining Whites' inequitable material accumulation. I problematize the logic of DL--highlighting that DL has the elitist tendencies of world-language education--and assess DL's potential to deliver educational justice to Latinxs.",

Propensity score matching and school fixed effects models suggest that having close college-bound friends is positively associated with enrolling in college. However, Black and Latino male students are much less likely to benefit from having college-bound friends than others, suggesting that structural and cultural factors that are tied to race, ethnicity, and gender may limit the beneficial potential of friends, especially for these male Black and Latino students. Implications for addressing racial and ethnic disparities in college enrollment and for the role of friends in college enrollment decisions are discussed.",

Robust findings indicate that higher charter school enrollment is associated with larger White-Black test score gaps and this effect is mediated by White-Black segregation.

        "description":"Gains in school spending helped to lift achievement over the past half century. But California's ambitious effort--progressively distributing $23 billion in yearly funding to poorer districts--has yet to reduce disparities in learning. We theorize how administrators in districts and schools, given organizational habits and labor constraints, may fail to move quality resources to disadvantaged students. We identify the exogenous portion of California's post-2013 reform, finding that schools receiving progressively targeted funding tended to hire inexperienced teachers and disproportionately assign novices to courses serving English learners. New funding expanded the array of courses in high schools, as access to college-preparatory classes by English learners declined. These unfair mechanisms operated most strongly in high-needs schools serving larger concentrations of poor students.",

To address absenteeism, many states have recently made chronic absence a core component of their school accountability plans. Scholars have theorized that a positive school climate can promote student attendance, but empirical support for this idea is lacking. In this study, the relationship between four student-reported measures of school climate and student attendance are investigated by analyzing two annual school climate surveys (N = 823,753) from New York City. Results indicate small associations among the four measures of perceived school climate and student attendance. Furthermore, school-level changes in perceived school climate between middle and high school were only marginally associated with student attendance.",

Though race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status only account for about 4% of the variance in SLL, nearly all prior work focuses on these factors. We zoom out to the full spread of differential SLL and its contribution to students' positions in the eighth-grade achievement distribution. Using a large, longitudinal NWEA data set, we document dramatic variability in SLL. While some students actually maintain their school-year learning rate, others lose nearly all their school-year progress. Moreover, decrements are not randomly distributed--52% of students lose ground in all 5 consecutive years (English language arts).",

Growth in skills slowed during summer for all children, but the patterns varied by domain and group. Non-White and dual language learner students showed the largest drop-off in language skills during summer. Lower-income students demonstrated slower summer growth in math skills than their higher-income peers. Students enrolled in summer center-based care had faster growth in math skills than those who did not attend care. Yet lower-income students who attended center-based care showed slower growth in language skills during summer than similar nonattenders. Implications are discussed.",

Drawing from analytic frameworks attune to the intersectional politics of race and neoliberalism, this article centers the voices of these educators to raise important questions about the neoliberal logics commonly undergirding intervention strategies aimed at boys and young men of color. In particular, these youth workers outline the ways neoliberal notions of respectability and heteropatriarchy become the expected performances for Latino men working with Latino boys. They also describe the ways they resist the positive male role model label to challenge neoliberal definitions of Latino manhood.",

Using a randomized survey experiment, this study adds to the existing literature by assessing parents' preferences in a controlled environment, where they can be isolated from information asymmetries and constraints. Results suggest that achievement matters to parents but status matters more when evaluating quality and growth matters more when choosing between schools. Additionally, student demographics affect both parents' perception of school quality and their likelihood of selecting into a school. This article has important implications for the theory and practice of accountability as it offers new insights on parents' latent preferences for school qualities.",

We trace the myriad ways that guns literally and discursively shaped the multiple ecological contexts of the 3D Project in order to detail youth sociopolitical learning and extend traditional models of civic education. We propose a paradigm of speculative civic literacies that privileges a collaborative push toward democratic interrogation and innovation over integration into existing civic and political structures.",

Using a novel dataset and a difference-in-differences design, we found that implementing the UCS program increased the graduation rate by 1.1 percentage points for all students and 1.4 percentage points for students with disabilities. The increase in schooling outcomes for students with disabilities in UCS schools also was found to be positively correlated with perceptions about a more socially inclusive school environment.",

        "description":"With the pervasiveness of racism, some scholars have interrogated the role of discourse in perpetuating the racial status quo. While research has denoted how prominent leaders and policies advance deficit-laden characterizations of minoritized groups that reify racial hierarchies, how racial discourse is mobilized in day-to-day politics remains less understood. This study investigates this phenomenon by examining the racial appeals used by charter management organizations as they garner support. It finds that charter management organizations used color-evasive discourse and variable racial narratives to build the case for their organizations with funders, families, and school board members. This code-switching points to the strategic use of racial discourse in local politics while demonstrating how racial power can be manifested in the pursuit of resources.",

Leaks in the pipeline divert out historically marginalized students. An adaptation of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index captures the magnitude of these racial and ethnic disparities.

These differential effects are largely driven by rural-to-urban migrants and not by urban-to-urban migrants. Additionally, we find that rural migrant students benefit less from the positive effects of peer parental education than their local counterparts, especially when their local peers hold higher levels of discriminative attitudes toward rural migrant students in their classes.",

Phase 1 examines the extent of book distributions, integrating data from 74 organizations and their branches (297). Using geographic information systems, we determined the spatialized patterns of scarcity and/or opportunity and the alignment between the intended and actual audience. In Phase 2, we conducted nine focus groups from neighborhoods receiving these book distributions.

We argue that this disparity should be reduced. Using administrative data from three cohorts of Massachusetts public school students (N = 123,261) and two-level models, we estimate middle schools' value-added effects on eighth-grade and 10th-grade math scores and, importantly, a non-test score outcome: 4-year college enrollment. Comparing our results to teacher-centered studies, we find that school effects (encompassing both teaching- and nonteaching-related factors) are initially smaller but nearly as stable and perhaps more persistent than are individual teacher effects. Our study motivates future research estimating the long-term effects of both teachers and schools on a wide range of outcomes.",

        "description":"We examine the impact of the Texas Research Incentive Program (TRIP), a state policy that offers matching funds to incentivize private-sector donations to certain public universities. We use a national dataset and employ a generalized difference-in-differences approach with matching procedures to estimate the treatment effect of TRIP on revenues at eligible institutions. Results show that TRIP is associated with increases in revenue from private gifts and state grants/contracts, which suggests that policymakers can leverage public investment to incentivize private donations. We do not detect a statistically significant relationship between TRIP and endowments, so donations are likely used for short-term funding and do not create long-term dividends. We consider potential social consequences of selecting certain universities to benefit from incentive policies.",

Web-based coaching programs can be operated at relatively lower costs, are scalable, and make it more feasible to pair teachers with coaches who have expertise in their content area and grade level. Results from our randomized field trial document sizable and sustained effects on both teachers' ability to analyze instruction and on their instructional practice, as measured by the Mathematical Quality of Instruction instrument and student surveys. However, these improvements in instruction did not result in corresponding increases in math test scores as measured by state standardized tests or interim assessments. We discuss several possible explanations for this pattern of results.",

The findings illustrate that professors who use race-conscious language and tools to interrogate their campus culture's historical roots with racism rethought their hiring process. In doing so, faculty perceived racial equity work as an action-oriented, organizational effort to use equity-minded language and create a more equitable hiring structure. The study contributes to the literature on organizational change for racial equity by identifying faculty experiences with racism and critical knowledge about the organizational culture mediating faculty learning and agency.",

Using data from the 2006 and 2009 waves of the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey, we estimate the relationship between teacher-child racial/ethnic match and parental involvement both across and within Head Start centers. Findings suggest that match enhances parental engagement and decreases student absences, particularly among Hispanic families, suggesting that family engagement may be one potential mechanism by which racial/ethnic match improves educational outcomes.

One view holds that schools can narrow inequality by generating dense relationships among families, while others suggest that advantaged parents can use these networks to hoard opportunities. This multiple case study analyzes qualitative data from diverse North Carolina elementary schools to learn how parents build and deploy social capital. We distinguish between bonding social capital, built in dense, homogeneous networks, and bridging social capital, gained through relationships across a social distance. Our analyses suggest that bonding alone is associated with opportunity hoarding; however, when schools are committed to building both bridging and bonding social capital, they can produce more equitable and inclusive schools.",

Gaps in disciplinary action, grade-level retention, classification into special education and Gifted and Talented, and Advanced Placement course-taking are large in magnitude and correlated. Racial differences in family income and parent education are strikingly consistent predictors of these gaps, and districts with large gaps in one outcome are likely to have large gaps in another. Socioeconomic and segregation variables explain 1.7 to 3.5 times more variance for achievement relative to nonachievement outcomes. Systemic patterns of racial socioeconomic inequality drive inequalities across multiple educational outcomes; however, discretionary policies at local levels are more influential for nonachievement outcomes.",

How do subgroup entitlement policies for English learners and students with disabilities shape daily opportunity provision--the day-to-day distribution of resources--in segregated schools? This ethnographic study of a public middle school reveals that the implementation of subgroup entitlement policies shaped the opportunity structure for all students through: (1) creating tracks that offered distinct conditions for learning; (2) fragmenting the organizational structure and inhibiting coordination; (3) exposing the school to increased compliance pressure that hierarchized priorities; and (4) utilizing subgroup-specific resources for general education students.",

        "description":"The continuous improvement (CI) approach to systems change has rapidly spread across education policy circles in recent years and has been hailed as a promising means to achieve educational equity and social justice. CI's highly routinized, scientific process for improving efficiency and productivity is a somewhat unexpected means to pursue equity. To understand this puzzle, I examine the use of CI to promote equity through two qualitative, multilevel case studies. I draw on institutional theory to understand how CI has integrated logics of racial equity and performance, and how local actors have improvised novel approaches. This analysis illuminates the complex institutional dynamics at play with CI implementation and identifies the challenges and promise of using CI to promote educational equity.",

        "description":"A core motivation for the widespread teacher evaluation reforms of the past decade was the belief that these new systems would promote teacher development through high-quality feedback. We examine this theory by studying teachers' perceptions of evaluation feedback in Boston Public Schools and evaluating the district's efforts to improve feedback through an administrator training program. Teachers generally reported that evaluators were trustworthy, fair, and accurate but that they struggled to provide high-quality feedback. We find little evidence that the training program improved perceived feedback quality, classroom instruction, teacher self-efficacy, or student achievement. Our results illustrate the challenges of using evaluation systems as engines for professional growth when administrators lack the time and skill necessary to provide frequent, high-quality feedback.",

While there is significant policy attention that has affected the scope of these agreements, there is relatively little research on how CBAs vary over time, or whether they change in response to states' legislative reforms. Using a panel data set of over 1,200 CBAs across three states, we compare CBA change before and after reforms in two states (Michigan and Washington) relative to a state with no statutory changes (California). We show that the state policy reforms lessened the restrictiveness of CBAs, as intended. The results suggest when reforms limit bargaining negotiations, unions are unable to compensate for the substantial reductions in working conditions.",

        "description":"Professional development [PD] providers can shape how teachers understand and implement new policies. Yet we have a limited understanding of how providers develop the ideas they promote. We explore this by examining social capital among mathematics PD providers. Using social network and interview data, we identified providers in brokerage positions and analyze their interactions. We found that broker behavior varied by organizational setting. Brokers in school districts typically discussed logistical issues related to PD delivery, while brokers outside of districts often discussed substantive mathematical topics. When district brokers did access substantive information, they rarely shared it. We conclude that (1) the disconnect between accessing and sharing diminished district brokers' ability to support PD in their districts and (2) the lack of substance diminished their ability to influence ideas about mathematics.",

In response to such silencing, this study employs counter-narratives rooted in a critical race methodology to illuminate the modern contributions of HBCUs as told by their chief executive officers--HBCU presidents. These contributions include transforming today's learners into tomorrow's leaders, a commitment to serving low-income students that is unencumbered by their financial strains, and tapping the potential of students who were marginalized in prior academic environments.",

Our findings reveal that classroom, school, district, state, and national contexts often manifested in pressure from colleagues, parents, the administration, the district, and the public. This pressure is reflective of the lack of trust, autonomy, and professionalism for teachers in our current climate. The days immediately following the election revealed new understandings about teachers' views on neutrality, opportunities for agency within control of teachers' work, and a call for justice-oriented pedagogy.

Instead, strong principals may seek to strategically influence the composition of their school's teaching force by retaining high performers and not retaining lower performers. We investigate such strategic retention behaviors with longitudinal data from Tennessee. Using multiple measures of teacher and principal effectiveness, we document that indeed more effective principals see lower rates of teacher turnover, on average. Moreover, this lower turnover is concentrated among high-performing teachers. In contrast, turnover rates of the lowest-performing teachers, as measured by classroom observation scores, increase substantially under higher-rated principals.

The main research question was whether the student participants in the intervention outperformed the students in the control classes, as assessed by several measures of comprehension and application of information to modeling biological phenomena not covered in the instruction. A second research question examined the impact on the instructional practices of the teachers who implemented the intervention. Multilevel modeling of outcome measures, controlling for preexisting differences at individual and school levels, indicated significant effects on the intervention students and teachers relative to the controls. Implications for classroom instruction and teacher professional development are discussed.",

However, early childhood educators have concerns with this policy as gains in achievement may come at the expense of children's social-emotional skills. Using a nationally representative data set of kindergartners, we find that advanced academic content, defined as academic skills typically taught at a higher grade, was associated not only with improved math and English/language arts achievement but also with improved social-emotional outcomes. Greater exposure to advanced content was associated with better interpersonal skills, better approaches to learning, better attentional focus, and lower externalizing behaviors. The results suggest that advanced academic content can be taught without compromising children's social-emotional skills.",

Using a cluster-randomized experimental design, the study compares the outcomes for teachers in an analysis-of-practice program with those of teachers in a content-deepening program. Mediational analyses explore the relationship between teacher outcomes and student learning. In comparison with the content-deepening PD program, the analysis-of-practice PD program significantly impacted teachers' knowledge and practice. Mediation analyses revealed a strong relationship between teaching practice and student learning.

This narrative analysis explores how high-achieving students of color construct identities-in-practice in a diverse urban middle school. By documenting explicit moments in which students construct identities-in-practice such as being &quot;loud,&quot; which are positioned as incompatible with &quot;being smart,&quot; I argue that high-achieving lower income students of color are disproportionately regulated by achievement discourses that position White middle-class norms as neutral. This article documents tensions between what it takes to achieve academically and students' raced, classed, and gendered identities in order to reframe educational equity based on a theoretical framing of identities and academic achievement as interrelated and highly contextual.",

Across these districts, the youths reported that race was a central aspect of their identity and demonstrated varying levels of public regard. Racial discrimination was negatively associated with academic curiosity and persistence, but this effect was moderated by gender and racial identity.

Although no benefits emerged for executive functioning, children who participated in formal early childhood programs at the age of 3 entered prekindergarten the following year demonstrating stronger academic skills and less optimal social behavior than their peers with no earlier educational experience. However, these academic benefits were short-lived and did not persist through the end of prekindergarten, in large part because children who did not attend these programs at age 3 caught up with their classmates who did. Roughly a quarter of this convergence in academics was attributed to children's subsequent classroom experiences.",

The implications for practice in both teacher education and science education show that educational and emotional support for teachers of color throughout their educational and professional journey is imperative to increasing and sustaining Black teachers.

Using rich, longitudinal data, we estimate the effects of residential mobility on the performance of New York City public school students. Using both student fixed effects and instrumental variables approaches, we find that long-distance moves have negative effects, while short-distance moves improve student performance. These differential effects are partially, but not fully, explained by school mobility. Rather, the positive effects of short-distance moves may be explained by improvements in housing, while the negative impacts of long-distance moves may be explained by lower performance relative to school peers and loss of social capital.",

        "author":["Givens, Jarvis R."],
        "description":"This article analyzes Carter G. Woodson's iconic Negro History Week and its impact on Black schools during Jim Crow. Negro History Week introduced knowledge on Afro-diasporic history and culture to schools around the country. As a result of teachers' grassroots organizing, it became a cultural norm in Black schools by the end of the 1930s. This program reflected Woodson's critique that anti-Black ideas in school knowledge were inextricably linked to the violence Black people experienced in the material world. Thus, he worked to construct a new system of knowledge altogether. Negro History Week engaged students in this counterhegemonic knowledge through performances grounded in Black formalism and an invigorated Black aesthetic, facilitating what I have come to call &quot;embodied learning.&quot;",

        "description":"By 1982, the queer student group at the University of Florida (UF) had gained official recognition and space on campus. However, in 1987 they decided to remove themselves from university life. The group reemerged in 1991 with the assistance of a new, quietly radical entity--The UF Committee on Sexism and Homophobia. Anchored by the oral histories of Phyllis Meek and Irene Stevens, the founders of the UF Committee on Sexism and Homophobia, the historical analysis of this overlooked episode is designed to illuminate the quieter role faculty and staff in higher education played in sustaining the civil rights and human dignities of queer people at UF during a time when students activism had lost momentum.",

Typically, concern is focused on the role played by the madrasah (Islamic religious school; plural madaaris) as the dominant provider of education. The rise in the number of English-medium education institutions countrywide does not enter such accounts. This ethnographic study relates this topic to the pedagogic aspirations of Pakistanis asking, What is the role of English-medium schools in Pakistan and is it even the case that the majority of Pakistanis are markedly in favor of a predominantly religious education for their children? The study suggests that formal English-medium education is most parents' real-world priority, fluency in English being a prerequisite for higher paying jobs in Pakistan.",

Artifacts (e.g., PD tasks, materials, and agendas) of the PD activities completed by 542 teachers in 21 different Mathematics and Science Partnership programs were coded based on the core features of PD identified in earlier literature. Multilevel analyses examined whether the programs' focus on specific components of teacher knowledge (e.g., knowledge of mathematics teaching) and specific strategies for implementing the PD content (e.g., examining students' work and solving mathematics problems) were related to gains in teachers' mathematical knowledge. The results showed that a focus on curricular content knowledge and examining students' work were significantly related to teachers' learning.

We also report on results from an information experiment built around the initial ratings release. In the experiment we provided targeted information about specific programmatic changes that would improve the rating for a randomly selected sample of elementary teacher education programs. Average program ratings improved between 2013 and 2016, but we find no evidence that the information intervention increased program responsiveness to NCTQ's rating effort. In fact, treated programs had lower ratings than the control group in 2016.",

A near-zero total effect of gender on high school STEM enrollment reflected pathways favoring boys through achievement and expectancy-value variables, but a counteracting direct effect of gender favoring girls. In contrast, subsequent university STEM enrollment favored boys. In both high school and university, enrollments favored girls in life sciences and boys in physical sciences, but at university there was a leaky pipeline in which girls who qualified to pursue physical sciences opted for non-STEM subjects. Qualitative analysis not only supported quantitative results but also highlighted alternative mechanisms of STEM engagement/disengagement, and mostly supported gender similarities rather than differences.",

We find that when AAPI data are disaggregated, significant variations in discipline patterns emerge. Pacific Islanders are nearly twice as likely as their White peers to be disciplined when separated from Asian Americans, and all Pacific Islander subgroups are at equal or higher risk for discipline. We also find a discipline gap between ethnic subgroups. Our findings affirm the need to further refine the analyses of race and school discipline.",

We examine the characteristics of teachers rated as &quot;minimally effective&quot; and &quot;ineffective,&quot; as well as their schools, and the relationship between low effectiveness ratings and later employment outcomes. Results suggest teachers of color across traditional and charter schools are more likely to receive low effectiveness ratings than their within-school peers. These low rating risks are higher for teachers of color working in comparatively White-faculty contexts.

Many eliminate effort and behavior scores, remove the zero, adopt a four-point system, advocate rubrics, or promote their own software packages. To study changes in grading, we collected data in two New York high schools undergoing a year-long professional development program on rethinking grading. We not only used existing literature on grading to frame our study but also relied on institutional theory and teacher identity as frameworks. We found that productive teacher change occurred, but it was partial, tentative, contingent on school-wide support, and not without frustration on the part of teachers.",

We found that parents viewed discipline as more than rule-following, valuing also self-discipline and academic discipline. While no-excuses parents supported an orderly environment, many found the discipline restrictive. Parents in the Montessori schools, by contrast, praised student autonomy but questioned whether the freedom was preparing their students academically.

Forty-six schools in three school districts participated. Students in treatment schools were taught the intervention by classroom teachers during regular mathematics instruction. Students in control schools received only regular mathematics instruction. Using a three-level longitudinal piecewise hierarchical linear model, the study explored the impact of the intervention in terms of both performance (correctness) and strategy use in students' responses to written algebra assessments. Results show that during Grade 3, treatment students, including those in at-risk settings, improved at a significantly faster rate than control students on both outcome measures and maintained their advantage throughout the intervention.",

We apply models of commuting stress developed for adult commuters to students in an open enrollment school district to examine whether commuting difficulty plays a part in school absence. By comparing residentially stable students with themselves as they transition from eighth to ninth grade, we identify how changes in estimated school transportation are related to changes in attendance. We find that all students miss more days in high school than they did in middle school and that changing transit demands are associated with an increase in absences.",

To begin filling this gap in the literature, I conduct discrete-time survival analysis on an aggregated data set of 47 states from 1995 to 2012 to investigate the extent to which various characteristics of a state predict its likelihood of adopting a statewide affirmative action ban. Results show that scarcity of access to state public flagship institutions and policy diffusion are associated with ban adoption. Aligning with the racial threat literature, the findings suggest that these bans are associated with concerns about the scarcity of access to selective higher education institutions (operationalized as state public flagships) for White students.",

Coaches accountable to district leaders spent more time working with teachers on instruction than their school-hired counterparts, who devoted more time to administrative and teaching duties. However, all coaches had limited opportunities to work with teachers in ongoing ways. Also, as district accountability systems became more robust, all coaches engaged in more administrative work.

Results indicate college credits earned in high school are related to reduced time to degree, double majoring, and more advanced coursework. Bounding exercises suggest the time to degree and double major outcomes are not likely driven by bias from unobserved student characteristics.

Indeed, little is known about under what conditions partnerships are likely to lead to organizational learning outcomes. We conducted a longitudinal comparative case study of two departments in one urban school district central office, both working with the same external partner. Data included 131 interviews and 372 hours of observations as well as artifacts and social network data. While one department did not incorporate the partner's ideas into policies and routines, the other demonstrated greater integration. We argue this difference is due to organizational conditions that foster absorptive capacity and to the nature of department--partner interactions.",

This study draws on institutional logics as a framework to analyze 106 instructional decisions from 24 participants involved in middle school literacy instruction. In lower-track classes, participants often adapted the curriculum and adopted a more teacher-centered approach. About half of the rationales for those decisions reflected a logic of tracking, less than a fifth reflected a logic of differentiation, and almost a third reflected elements of both logics. These findings demonstrate that despite common standards, a tracked school structure continues to serve as a powerful signal about the curriculum and instruction seen as appropriate for different groups of students.",

We drew upon social network analysis of student survey data in 46 English and math middle school classrooms and qualitative analysis of a subset of these classrooms (N = 10) to address the following: (a) How do demographics differ in classrooms with more or less academic peer network linguistic integration? and (b) How do teachers' classroom practices relate to differences in the linguistic integration of students' academic peer networks? Findings from this analysis add to the literature on the complex relationships between classroom characteristics, linguistic integration, and teacher practices.",

Different types of data, data collected rationally and intuitively, may be used in this sensemaking process, and the same data may be interpreted in different ways by different teachers. Results show that teachers base their decisions on rational processes only to a limited extent. Teachers collect a great amount of data intuitively, and they sometimes interpret data collected rationally by personal criteria and triangulate data to a very limited extent. Since fair educational decisions are informed by a rational collection and a transparent interpretation of data, implications for theory and practice are provided.",

In the analytic sections, we tease apart aspects of politicization, showcasing examples of transformation that center political concept development, changing practices, reconfigured ways of knowing, and new identities in formation.",

The qualitative study reported here was part of a larger, mixed methods study of PD for self-regulated strategy development (SRSD) in writing; the randomized controlled trial found significant and meaningful outcomes for teachers and students. In the current qualitative study, 14 Grades 2 and 3 teachers discussed semistructured, open-ended questions in small focus groups regarding their experiences with, reactions to, and evaluations of aspects and components of PD and SRSD. These teachers' voices contribute to our understanding of critical aspects of effective PD as well as SRSD.",

These findings support the contention that higher SES parents are not necessarily more involved than lower SES parents in all aspects, and that higher levels of parental involvement may not eventuate in higher levels of student achievement.",

To fill this gap, this research examines the essence of giving back as it is experienced by Native college graduates. It explores, through both Indigenous and phenomenological research methodologies, how Native college graduates come to value giving back, enact giving back, and make meaning of giving back. The findings from this study contribute to what is known about how Native college graduates may contribute to the self-determination of their nations and call for a reconceptualization of postsecondary success for Native peoples.",

In this study, I trace a teacher's journey--new to critical pedagogies--as she learned about community cultural wealth and incorporated family histories as counterstorytelling curricula with her sixth-grade class of immigrant students in California's Central Valley. I examine the pedagogical implementation with examples of students' meaning making. The teacher and students demonstrated what I am advancing as migration capital--or knowledges, sensibilities, and skills cultivated through the array of migration/immigration experiences to the United States or its borderlands. This study highlights the potential of community cultural wealth pedagogies and as pedagogical tools to counter deficit narratives with Latina/o immigrant youth.",

Using nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-2011 (ECLS-K:2011), we constructed parallel growth and lagged score models within both seasonal learning and school effects frameworks to study how student- and school-level socioeconomic and racial/ethnic backgrounds relate to student learning. Our findings suggest that seasonal comparative scholars, who generally argue that schools play an equalizing role, and scholars focused on school compositional effects, who typically report that schools exacerbate inequality, come to these contrasting findings not only because they ask different questions but also because they treat student initial achievement differently when modeling student learning.",

Children who attended playgroup had better development at school entry relative to those who had not attended playgroup, after adjustment for a range of confounding factors. These differences were observed across all five developmental domains and were universal to children from a range of backgrounds.

Using student fixed effects models of within-person change over time, individuals' performance on standardized tests were compared before, during, and/or after special education placement. Results indicate that test scores of students with disabilities improved after being enrolled in special education.

        "description":"Conceptualizing educational inequality as equivalent to the &quot;achievement gap&quot; has fueled the expansion of no-excuses charters, which purport to raise test scores and thereby equalize opportunities for low-income students of color. In contrast, I argue that the individual provision of opportunity is inadequate to address the structural inequalities that create differential achievement, and thus that no-excuses schools cannot be assessed using test scores alone. This ethnographic study examines how no-excuses classroom management shapes students' development as citizens. My findings suggest that no-excuses classroom management is not a supportive structure that enables academic achievement, but a restrictive and often unfair system that reinforces compliance to institutional authority. I contend that the consequences of this system are more likely to perpetuate than to ameliorate inequality.",

A randomized control study was conducted with a sample of U.S. high school graduates (n = 303) to test this SEL methodology. The impact of a 1-hour online intervention involving learning a simple model of appraisal was tested. As predicted, the experimental groups rated their own and others' emotional reactions as significantly less blameworthy than the control group did, signaling emotion knowledge transfer and greater empathy and emotion acceptance.

Our study results show that immigration enforcement is affecting all students--both those from immigrant homes and those that are not. In particular, Title I schools are the most affected by immigration enforcement. Our results also show that the higher the percentage of White students, the more educators reported immigrant students being exposed to a hostile, anti-immigrant environment.

        "description":"For over a decade, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has formed partnerships allowing local police to enforce immigration law by identifying and arresting undocumented residents. Prior studies, using survey data with self-reported immigrant and citizenship status, provide mixed evidence on their demographic impact. This study presents new evidence based on Hispanic public school enrollment. We find local ICE partnerships reduce the number of Hispanic students by 10% within 2 years. We estimate partnerships enacted before 2012 displaced more than 300,000 Hispanic students. These effects are concentrated among elementary school students. We find no corresponding effects on the enrollment of non-Hispanic students and no evidence that ICE partnerships reduced pupil-teacher ratios or the percentage of students eligible for the National School Lunch Program.",

Did the confrontation result in a balance between these warring sides? We use text analysis to identify research trends in 137,024 dissertation abstracts from 1980 to 2010 and relate these to students' academic employment outcomes. Topics associated with the interpretive approach rose in popularity, while the outcomes-oriented paradigm declined. Academic employment remained stably associated with topics in the interpretive approach, but their effect is moderated by the prestige of the students' institutions. The relation between topic popularity and employability provides insight into field change and how the benefits of cultural shifts fall along the lines of institutional power.",

However, the extremes could also be important because disparities at the top may shape stratification in access to STEM careers, while disparities at the bottom can shape stratification in dropout. This article investigates determinants of gender disparities in math across the performance distribution in Latin American countries, where there is a persistent boys' advantage in STEM performance. Findings reveal disparate national patterns in gender gaps across the performance distribution. Furthermore, while certain national characteristics are linked to gender gaps at the low- and middle-ranges of the performance distribution, female representation in education is the only characteristic associated with a reduced gender gap at the top level.",

Currently, research in evidence-based education policy and practice focuses on randomized controlled trials.

We argue that moving from ascription to prediction by way of causal generalization (&quot;It works&quot;) is unrealistic and urge focusing research efforts directly on how to build local effectiveness predictions. We outline various kinds of information that can improve predictions and encourage using methods better equipped for acquiring that information. We compare our proposal with others advocating a better mix of methods, like implementation science, improvement science, and practice-based evidence.",

Increasingly, for-profit companies that develop and sell digital courseware products influence what college students learn. Employees' pedagogical expertise, content knowledge, and understanding of organizational goals are likely to affect product characteristics and outcomes associated with the use of those products. This study draws on 15 months of ethnographic data to examine one organization's efforts to develop and sell courseware for use in higher education. The data suggest organization members' interpretations of educational access and quality support product development and sales efforts consistent with profit aims, but that may promote credentialism, negatively affect learning, and exacerbate quality differences across institutions.",

Analysis of the discourse on KF showed that the low achievers were able to engage in productive discourse, with evidence of metacognitive, collaborative, and epistemic inquiry. Analysis illustrates how the design supported student engagement, including (1) reflective inquiry and social metacognition; (2) reflective meta- and epistemic talk; (3) evidence-based reflection for collective growth; and (4) reflection embedded in community ethos.

        "description":"This study examines the impact of a &quot;natural experiment&quot; that gave students the choice to place into or out of developmental math because of an unintended mistake made by a community college. During self-placement, more students chose to enroll in gateway college- and transfer-level math courses, however, greater proportions of female, Black, and Hispanic students enrolled in the lowest levels of math relative to test-placed counterparts. Difference-in-difference estimates show that self-placement led to positive outcomes, but mostly for White, Asian, and male students. This evidence suggests areas of concern and potential for improvement for self-placement policies. Self-determination theory, behavioral decision theory, and stereotype vulnerability provide possible explanations for the observed changes.",

Yet teacher education program leaders indicate it can be difficult to recruit instructionally effective teachers to serve as CTs, in part because teachers worry that serving may negatively impact district evaluation scores. Using a unique data set on over 4,500 CTs, we compare evaluation scores during years these teachers served as CTs with years they did not. In years they served as CTs, teachers had significantly better observation ratings and somewhat better achievement gains, though not always at significant levels. These results suggest that concerns over lowered evaluations should not prevent teachers from serving as CTs. [For the corresponding grantee submission, see ED598652.]",

Results indicate that preK had no measurable impact on children's third-grade math achievement regardless of children's neighborhood conditions. However, preK significantly improved third-grade reading achievement for children living in high-poverty neighborhoods. The treatment effects on reading achievement were substantial: Among children living in high-poverty neighborhoods, those who took up an experimental assignment to attend preK scored over half a standard deviation higher on average than the control group in third grade. In contrast, preK enrollment had, if anything, a negative effect on third-grade reading achievement among children living in low-poverty neighborhoods. These differential effects were partially explained by alternative childcare options and contextual risk factors.",

We find that the separation of language and content at the district level limited teachers' learning opportunities, yet school leaders mitigated this separation by implementing structures that fostered norms of shared responsibility and collaborative teaching. Findings highlight the relevance of an organizational perspective for understanding how suburban districts respond to demographic change, and have implications for policymakers and practitioners with respect to creating inclusive environments for ELs.",

Drawing on 7 million records of online instructional sessions linked to student records, we find mostly negative associations between online course-taking and math and reading scores, with some gains in credits earned and grade point averages by upperclassmen. Those least prepared academically and with weaker course-taking behaviors fared more poorly and were likely set back by online course-taking. Limited resources constrained the implementation of district-recommended practices and instructional supports, such as live teacher interactions and individualized content assistance.",

While the properties of constituent measures have been studied, little is known about whether composite ratings themselves are sufficiently reliable to support high-stakes decision making. We address this gap by estimating the consistency of composite ratings of teacher quality from New Mexico's teacher evaluation system from 2015 to 2016. We estimate that roughly 40% of teachers would receive a different composite rating if reevaluated in the same year; 97% of teachers would receive ratings within ±1 level of their original rating. We discuss mechanisms by which policymakers can improve rating consistency, and the implications of those changes to other properties of teacher evaluation systems.",

The results of document analysis, surveys, interviews, and generational narratives conducted in a rurban county in a southeastern U.S. state indicate a need for a critical rurban pedagogy that merges a critical pedagogy of place with local values and the complexities of rurban culture to serve as a foundation from which to build culturally relevant curricula.",

Embedded and competing narratives within charter school applications are analyzed. The authorization process is the central gatekeeping mechanism in the reproduction of charter schools. The authorization process determines who gets to govern schools, including the freedom to set curriculum, discipline policies, personnel, utilization of funds, and their relationship to and role in the communities in which they are located. This article unpacks the community based and &quot;no excuses&quot; discourses within charter applications. It finds patterns of confluence between those narratives and the applicants' racial and educational identities, suggesting that the authorization process worked as a site for the reproduction of racialized neoliberal dominance in post-Katrina New Orleans, disenfranchising local teachers and communities.",

        "description":"Preschoolers are being expelled at an alarming rate and little is known about protective factors. One factor may be the relationship between parents and teachers. Using surveys and interviews, the present study explores teachers' perceptions of parents and center support as they relate to teachers' requests to have a child removed from their classroom, an action related to expulsion. Teachers who have more negative perceptions of parents and perceive less center support working with parents were more likely to have requested a removal of a child in the past year. Qualitative comparisons yield differential themes around attribution of child behavior to parents and styles of engagement with parents between teachers who have requested a removal and those who have not.",

We find that the average U.S. school district has no gender achievement gap in math, but there is a gap of roughly 0.23 standard deviations in ELA that favors girls. Both math and ELA gaps vary among school districts; some districts have more male-favoring gaps and some more female-favoring gaps. Math gaps tend to favor males more in socioeconomically advantaged school districts and in districts with larger gender disparities in adult income, education, and occupations; however, we do not find strong associations in ELA.",

Although charter school leaders are motivated by student- and school-level benefits of pre-K, they face unique obstacles to funding classrooms. We find that the number of pre-K seats fell substantially as decision making and budgeting were decentralized. Charter schools that did offer pre-K experienced few internal benefits, on average, in terms of future enrollment or test performance, as pre-K graduates are highly mobile. This study provides initial evidence that decentralization without offsetting financial incentives can lead to reduced investments in programs that advance the social goals of education.",

I test the interaction between school-level racial composition and student-level race as a predictor of special education receipt. I find that as the proportion of White students increases, the risk of lower-status disabilities, such as intellectual disability, increases for Black, Latinx, and Native American students. As the proportion of White students decreases, White students' risk of higher-status disabilities, such as speech/language impairment, increases relative to students of color.

Currently, the research base is limited regarding how effective teachers implement formative assessment strategies in their classrooms and how teachers in general perceive formative assessment. Thus, the purpose of this study was to gain a broader understanding of how teachers conceptualize and enact formative assessment strategies in their classrooms with the aim of providing guidance to teacher educators, professional development providers, and policy makers about gaps in teachers' understanding of and use of formative assessment. Findings from classroom observations revealed that master teachers implemented some aspects of formative assessment effectively and other areas were used much less frequently and/or effectively. Teachers within the participating districts reported similar use frequencies. Implications for research and practice in the area of formative assessment are discussed.",

The results also reveal that stronger principal leadership may protect teachers from lack of access to any mentor or to high-quality mentoring while weaker leadership may diminish the potential benefits of high-quality mentoring.",

Specifically, men and teachers in classrooms with high concentrations of Black, Hispanic, male, and low-performing students receive significantly lower observation ratings. By using various methodological approaches and a subsample of teachers randomly assigned to classrooms, we demonstrate that these differences are unlikely due to actual differences in teacher quality. These results suggest that policymakers consider the unintended consequences of using observational ratings to evaluate teachers and consider ways to adjust ratings to ensure they are fair.",

        "description":"Based on the framework of critical quantitative intersectionality, the purpose of this study is to examine the multifaceted impacts of Southeast Asian female students' race or ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status on math achievement score and intention to enter higher education. This study found that math achievement scores of Southeast Asian students were significantly higher than those of other race or ethnicity groups. However, Southeast Asian female students' intention to pursue higher education was significantly lower than that of Southeast Asian males as well as being the lowest among all female students. The school organizational characteristics used in this study did not mediate or differentiate the intersectionalities related to Southeast Asian female students. The patterns held regardless of schooling contexts.",

        "description":"The link between noncognitive skills and achievement is well established. There is much less evidence on how these skills are developed and transmitted to students, especially as it relates to girls that attend nonelite schools in non-Western settings. Drawing on insights from girl students attending an urban school in Ghana, this paper illustrates the role of school contexts in facilitating the development of noncognitive skills, namely, &quot;achievement-oriented identities&quot;--positive beliefs in one's own ability and the translation of those beliefs into realizable actions. These identities act as useful tools for navigating the gender-specific challenges that impede girls' abilities to achieve. These findings have implications for research on gender, noncognitive skills, and educational achievement in developing and developed societies.",

Despite this well-documented association, there is little experimental research on how to reduce absenteeism in the early grades. This paper presents results from a randomized field experiment in 10 school districts evaluating the impact of a low-cost, parent-focused intervention on student attendance in grades K-5. The intervention targeted commonly held parental misbeliefs undervaluing the importance of regular K-5 attendance as well as the number of school days their child had missed. The intervention decreased chronic absenteeism by 15%. This study presents the first experimental evidence on how to improve student attendance in grades K-5 at scale and has implications for increasing parental involvement in education.",

Self-report data for appraisals and emotions were collected from 579 students in their final year of primary schooling over three waves. Data were analyzed using latent interaction structural equation modeling. Control-value appraisals predicted emotions interactively depending on which specific subjective value was paired with perceived control. Achievement value amplified the positive relation between perceived control and enjoyment, and intrinsic value reduced the negative relation between perceived control and boredom. These longitudinal findings demonstrate that control and value appraisals, and their interaction, are critically important for the development of students' enjoyment and boredom over time.",

This policy analysis assesses the impact of California higher education policy on the state's community colleges that are considered minority-serving institutions (MSIs). Using longitudinal data to determine how the metrics have changed over time, we focus on three public policies that are manifestations of the master plan: (1) transfer between the California Community Colleges and California State University segments, (2) state funding for each segment, and (3) enrollment quotas for the California State University and University of California segments. We assess enrollment, finance, transfer, persistence, and completion measures to answer our primary research questions. While we find challenges for MSI students advancing to the completion of a 4-year degree, our findings also demonstrate that MSI community colleges can encourage minority student retention and associate's degree and certificate completion. By centering MSIs in the state policy context, this study brings to light the growing interrelated relationship between federal and state efforts to reduce racial inequality in higher education.",

Abby reveals tensions, disruptions, and self-discoveries within a course that recentered Indigenous histories and literacies while, concurrently, decentered dominant knowledge systems. Her story addresses this article's central question: How does Whiteness operate in an ethnic studies course? Eleven vignettes trace Abby's critical consciousness development within and beyond this course. Relying on Paris and Alim's (2014, 2017) culturally sustaining pedagogy and McCarty and Lee's (2014) culturally revitalizing pedagogy, I offer culturally disruptive pedagogy to argue that as educators, researchers, and community members seek ways to sustain and revitalize cultural practices, we must also consider the ways hegemonic norms--as perpetuated by ideologies of whiteness--require a needed disruption.",

Using data from repeated cross-sections of the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, this study draws on methodological innovations from research linking NCLB to academic outcomes to explore this possibility. Findings are suggestive of an immediate NCLB-based increase in engagement that diminished and ultimately became negative over time. Because engagement predicts both achievement and socio-emotional well-being, researchers and policymakers should work to ensure that the Every Student Succeeds Act facilitates accountability systems that promote engagement.",

Decades removed from the Civil Rights Movement, during a period of stark inequality, colorblind law and policymaking, and a diminished understanding of education as a societal benefit, the central suburban rationale for secession, local control, carries new weight. It gives already privileged communities a race-neutral, legally sanctioned, and politically persuasive way to discuss resource accumulation that maps onto existing racial and economic segregation. Memphis-area lessons offer insight into an increasing number of secession struggles and enrich our understanding of how educational advantage is consolidated in the 21st-century metropolis.",

This investigation asks how one such quality--grit--has become a commonsensical way to think about differences among students. As a history of the present, grit is approached as a cultural thesis that links individualism to narratives of American exceptionalism and historical progress. This thesis is embodied in contemporary school reforms to &quot;get gritty&quot; in order to close achievement gaps. A danger of these reforms is how pedagogies of grit generate classificatory regimes that divide people by the display of particular attitudes and behaviors. As grit travels globally, it decontextualizes social and economic inequalities and explains them as owing to the intrinsic qualities of people.",

Building a conceptual argument for an equity-oriented culture of making, the authors discuss the ways in which making with and in community opened opportunities for youth to project their communities' rich culture knowledge and wisdom onto their making while also troubling and negotiating the historicized injustices they experience.

This paper utilizes a unique data set that includes not only information about student course performance in STEM but also a number of motivation-related measures. We find that having a female instructor narrows the gender gap in terms of engagement and interest; further, both female and male students tend to respond to instructor gender.

Using five cycles of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) database, the current research explores within-country trajectories in achievement and inequality measures to test the hypothesis of an excellence/equity tradeoff in academic performance.

        "description":"This study provides the first national-level assessment of the size and academic performance of immigrant students with interrupted schooling. Exploiting unique aspects of the Educational Longitudinal Study (2002), a national-level survey of U.S. 10th graders, this study identifies students with interrupted schooling and uses multivariate analysis to assess their academic performance compared to other immigrants and nonimmigrants. Results indicate that over 10% of foreign-born youth experience interrupted schooling. These students have lower academic achievement and attainment than their peers, but are just as or more engaged in school. Premigration demographics, but not postmigration family and school characteristics, explain some of these academic performance differences and the consequences of interrupted schooling differ for primary- and secondary-grade-age arrivals.",

The rise of charter schools, alternative teacher certification, and portfolio districts are transforming teachers' access to employment, changing the way they search for and apply for jobs, and may also change the role that social networks play in the job search. However, we know little about how teachers use their networks to find jobs, particularly in increasingly fragmented local labor markets. We draw on interviews with 127 teachers in three districts chosen to reflect an increasing presence of charter schools: New Orleans, Detroit, and San Antonio.

Findings were corroborative across methods. After accounting for student-, classroom-, and school-level covariates, we found that ELs in more segregated classrooms exhibited lower performance, on average, on state tests of English language arts, mathematics, and English proficiency, and little evidence that classroom number of EL English proficiency levels was related to achievement.

For behaviors, digital highlighting and looking back at the paper text were supportive of reading comprehension, whereas paper highlighting was negatively related, likely because paper highlighting tended to occur often outside of important areas of the text.

The two focal children did not have equitable access to their teachers' pedagogical moves, and this lack of access was easy to overlook in transcripts of whole-class discussions.

The persisting gap is partly attributed to ELs' limited exposure to academic content. This article investigates the efficacy of a summer credit recovery program aimed at expanding high school newcomer ELs' access to academic subjects. Leveraging student-level data from a large urban district in California, I use a difference-in-differences-in-differences approach to estimate the program's impact on high school course taking, English proficiency, and graduation. Credit recovery increased the number of math, English Language Arts, science, and social science classes taken by newcomer EL students. Effects on 4- and 5-year graduation rates are imprecisely estimated. I also find suggestive evidence for positive effects on English proficiency.",

However, due to data limitations, descriptions of these contexts are often unidimensional or vague. Using 10 years of administrative data from the Los Angeles Unified School District, we describe patterns of new teacher sorting using 24 context measures organized along three dimensions--intensity of instructional responsibilities, homophily, and colleagues' qualifications--and use school-level survey data to measure a fourth dimension--professional culture. Relative to more experienced teachers, novice teachers have placements that are more challenging along the first three dimensions, and composite measures of the dimensions are differentially predictive of teachers' outcomes. This suggests that policymakers should carefully consider placements to better support novice teachers.",

This repetition of mistakes, I argue, stems from a failure to account for predictable patterns in how policies become unpopular. Through an analysis of 52 interviews with state, regional, and district officials in California, Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, I investigate the decline in the popularity of K-12 standards-based reform. I consolidate existing policy implementation theories and describe three important dimensions--detail, drive, and durability--for understanding how standards and associated policies &quot;succeed&quot; or &quot;fail.&quot; Using these dimensions, I reveal how policy design and implementation choices can strengthen or weaken standards-based education policies.

        "description":"Despite the wide-ranging scholarship on the educational attitudes held by native-born members of the middle and working class, few researchers have examined the impact of class on the attitudes of new arrivals. This article addresses this gap using data gathered through an ethnographic study conducted among 30 newly arrived refugee and immigrant youth from varying class backgrounds. Although all the students expressed high aspirations, those from a middle-class background were more likely to view academic performance in individualistic terms than their working- and lower-class peers, who were more critical of meritocracy. Optimistic views of opportunity may motivate students to overcome barriers, yet they may also obscure the significance of class disparities in education and foster a sense of self-blame among failing students.",

Interview analysis revealed the persistence of meritocracy, as teachers (a) located the problem within Black boys' identities; (b) constructed race, masculinity, and social class as barriers to students' academic success and teachers' effectiveness; and (c) positioned themselves relationally away from their students and the problem itself.

Data were collected during a university-based, accelerated teacher credentialing program. Analyses of videos of teacher education coursework revealed that while teacher educators frequently represented, decomposed, and approximated teaching practice, they rarely did so when discussing social justice issues.

Using a cross-sectional correlational survey design, 218 licensed K-12 professionals from 68 schools in one urban school district in the Midwest completed an on-line survey that included measures of moral injury and emotional and behavioral correlates. The K-12 professionals exhibited levels of moral injury similar to those experienced by military veterans. Correlational analyses found that experiences of moral injury were associated with feelings of guilt, troubled conscience, burnout, and the intention to leave one's job. Linear regression analyses demonstrated that professionals working in high-poverty, racially segregated schools were significantly more likely to endorse experiences of moral injury. These findings reinforce the significance of the intersectionality of race and class in reproducing oppressive and immoral educational practices and outcomes. A deeper understanding of and greater attention to potential sources of moral injury is critical in order to foster a more just and ethical education system.",

Empirically, the extent to which these initiatives generate such balance is an open question. In this article, we leverage the school assignment system that the Wake County Public School System employed throughout the 2000s to provide evidence on this issue. Although our results show that Wake County Public School System's socioeconomic-based assignment policy had negligible effects on average levels of segregation across the district, it substantially reduced racial segregation for students who would have attended majority-minority schools under a residence-based assignment policy. The policy also exposed these students to peers with different racial/ethnic backgrounds, higher mean achievement levels, and more advantaged neighborhood contexts. We explore how residential context and details of the policy interacted to produce this pattern of effects and close the article by discussing the implications of our results for research and policy.",

To explore alternative explanations for gender gaps in major declaration, we analyze interviews with college seniors, finding that they recognize many other factors, including their interests in subject matter and confidence, are key in pushing them from STEM or pulling them into non-STEM majors.

This study illuminates the mechanism by which the state, working through a complex public-private network of education policy actors, co-opts more radical demands to address the school-to-prison pipeline, coordinates interests across a range of social forces with particular attention to law enforcement, and commodifies the school-to-prison pipeline critique into marketable products and services for schools and school districts.",

Findings reflected sources of English (il)legitimacy to which educators were subjected based on negative reactions to their accents, race, communication, and vocabulary. In turn, cultural incongruence and confusion led educators to (re)claim their English legitimacy and to leverage pedagogical approaches regarding tone, expectation, delivery, and linguistic content and context. Through metalinguistic, metaracial, and metacultural understanding, educators reflected 'a transraciolinguistic approach,' (re)establishing legitimacy of their standardized Englishes as Black speakers in the U.S. academy. Implications for addressing challenges to the legitimacy of certain standardized Englishes used by racialized speakers in the academy are discussed.",

Employing critical race theory as an interpretive framework, the study found that many of these students were denied access to their priority UC campuses and were cascaded down to the least selective campuses. A small portion were not admitted to flagship UCs--Berkeley, Los Angeles, and San Diego--but were admitted to elite non-UC institutions. Moreover, these students decided to attend selective colleges and universities that demonstrated a commitment to admitting and financially supporting them. This study also discovered that these high-achieving students researched and experienced a range of racial climate issues at UC campuses, including racist activities and lack of compositional diversity, which contributed to their decisions not to enroll. The article includes recommendations for UC campus leaders and others committed to creating equitable postsecondary pathways for African American students.",

Drawing on critical discursive psychology, positioning theory, and narrative policy analysis, I examine how dyslexia advocacy discourse forms a cohesive, compelling policy narrative. I argue that this narrative can be understood as a conversion narrative, which drives a privatization agenda in which public schools become mandated consumers for a growing dyslexia industry, and in which the nature of instruction for students with reading difficulties is narrowly prescribed.",

The findings make visible the ways that legislators use the power of their positions to depict academic witnesses as both experts who offer independent knowledge and experts who validate or confirm a legislator's preferences and priorities. The results have implications for academics who seek to improve connections between research and policy, and academics who seek to further advance the production of knowledge of federal policymaking processes.",

Teachers trained in traditional, university-based programs are most likely to move schools, and alternate entry and out-of-state prepared teachers are more likely to leave teaching, both during and at the end of the school year.

Through these findings, I demonstrate the ways in which White student publications recorded whiteness as property, entitling White students to the use and enjoyment of their college years.

        "description":"While much is known about how Black students negotiate and navigate undergraduate studies, there is a dearth of research on what happens when these students enter graduate school. This article presents the results of a study of 21 Black male graduate students in engineering from one highly ranked research-intensive institution. This article provides evidence of structurally racialized policies within the engineering college (e.g., admissions) and racialized and gendered interactions with peers and advisors that threaten Black males' persistence in engineering. We argue for taking an anti-deficit approach to understanding Black males' persistence in engineering. We conclude with implications for policy, practice, and research that could further improve the scholarship and experiences of Black males in engineering graduate programs.",

The racialization of school discipline has been linked to long-term deleterious impacts on students' academic and life outcomes. In this article, we present a formative intervention, Learning Lab that addressed racial disparities in school discipline at a public high school. Learning Lab successfully united local stakeholders, specifically those who had been historically excluded from the school's decision-making activities. Learning Lab members engaged in historical and empirical root cause analyses, mapped out their existing discipline system, and designed a culturally responsive schoolwide behavioral support model in response to diverse experiences, resources, practices, needs, and goals of local stakeholders. Analysis drew on the theory of expansive learning to examine how the Learning Lab process worked through expansive learning actions. Implications for research and practice are discussed.",

I aim to illustrate that participants face pressure not only to instill resilience in their students but also to enact resilience themselves as they face repeated failures and frustrations in the urban and rural contexts in which they teach. Although participants could interpret their students' refusal to adhere to classroom norms as modes of resistance against schooling practices that have perpetuated colonial legacies, instead they frame students as passive and apathetic recipients of content rather than as agentic actors within their education.",

This article focuses on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the United States' largest food assistance program. Using administrative data on over 148,000 SNAP-receiving public school children, we analyze the recency of SNAP benefit transfer and children's end-of-grade math and reading achievement test scores. Results indicate differences in students' math and reading performance based on the recency of SNAP benefit transfer. Although the relationship is stronger for reading than for math, the relationship between students' test scores and SNAP transfer is roughly curvilinear. Test scores peak in the third week following benefit transfer.",

Like other such districts, the ASD removes schools from local control and is not accountable to local political institutions. Despite its authority, the ASD has encountered opposition within Memphis where its schools reside. For those inclined to its market orientation and suspicious of traditional districts, the ASD is an innovative effort to improve outcomes for disadvantaged students. For those that see educational failure in Memphis as the result of social and economic isolation, the ASD appears motivated by profit, paternalism, and racism. A third narrative, largely hidden from view, encompasses people who reject state takeover but seek to confront structural causes of poor performance.",

Prior research investigates two such types of knowledge: knowledge of student thinking and teacher accuracy in predicting student performance on cognitive assessments. However, the field presents weak evidence regarding whether these constructs are amenable to accurate measurement and whether such knowledge relates to instruction and student outcomes. Without this evidence, it is difficult to assess the relevance of this form of teacher knowledge. In this article, evidence from 284 teachers suggests that accuracy can be adequately measured and relates to instruction and student outcomes. Knowledge of student misconceptions proved more difficult to measure, yet still predicted student outcomes in one model.",

In response, we conducted an initial, year-long study of Quality Talk, a teacher-facilitated, small-group discussion approach designed to enhance students' basic and high-level comprehension, in two fourth-grade classrooms. Specifically, teachers delivered instructional mini-lessons on discourse elements (e.g., questioning or argumentation) and conducted weekly text-based discussions in their language arts classes. Analysis of the videorecorded discussions showed decreases in teacher-initiated discourse elements, indicating a release of responsibility to students, whereas students' discourse reflected increased critical-analytic thinking (e.g., elaborated explanations or exploratory talk). Importantly, statistically and practically significant increases were evidenced on written measures of students' basic and high-level comprehension, indicating the promise of small-group discourse as a way to foster individual student learning outcomes.",

A total of 81 first grade teachers and their 468 students from 19 Reading First schools formed the analytic sample in the study. Classroom observations of teaching practice showed significant improvements in TSG schools.

Although value-added estimates depend on the assessment used to measure student achievement, the importance of outcome selection has received scant attention in the literature. Using data from a large, urban school district, I examine whether value-added estimates from three separate reading achievement tests provide similar answers about teacher performance. I find moderate-sized rank correlations, ranging from 0.15 to 0.58, between the estimates derived from different tests. Although the tests vary to some degree in content, scaling, and sample of students, these factors do not explain the differences in teacher effects. Instead, test timing and measurement error contribute substantially to the instability of value-added estimates across tests. (Contains 14 notes, 9 tables, and 2 figures.)",

However, lacking are theoretically based studies that explain how and why a program may be effective in bringing about change. The authors studied a 12-week parent leadership program for Hispanics that provided opportunities for interaction, knowledge exchange, leadership development, trust building, and collective action--important components of social and intellectual capital. Their research shows that when parents participate in leadership development, they are empowered to effect changes that benefit their children through individual and collective actions. Some parent graduates founded organizations that continue to affect the educational system. The authors argue that the concepts of social and intellectual capital can inform parent involvement research and practice because they explain a community's capability to engage in new forms of action.

Lag sequential analysis was applied to a corpus of over 5,300 speaking turns during 30 discussions to identify recurrent turn-by-turn patterns of teacher-child and child-child talk initiated by the teacher's moves. A complex system of influence among discussion participants was documented in which the teacher's moves had delayed effects as well as immediate effects, indirect as well as direct effects, and reciprocal instead of unidirectional effects. Some children appropriated scaffolding moves of the teacher and began to spontaneously employ the moves in later discussions. (Contains 1 note, 6 tables, and 5 figures.)",

Cases focus on the young people's language and literacy histories and key patterns related to their language use in school as examples of the complexity of students who represent the New Mainstream.

This longitudinal case study draws upon social network analysis and interviews to examine the reform-related knowledge, advice, and innovation network structures of central office and site leaders in a district facing sanction for underperformance and engaging a districtwide reform. Findings indicate that over time, the networks increased the number of superficial interactions, and more frequent exchanges remained unchanged, resulting in a centralized network structure.

Hypotheses suggest that (a) coaches are not unproblematic conduits of reform ideas but are also learners of new content and pedagogy; (b) as coaches' conceptual development about instruction grows, their ability to coach also matures; and (c) professional development that supports coaches is best aligned around a workplace pedagogy that addresses the learning needs of multiple system actors.

A sociocultural framework of identity development is utilized, incorporating the notions of prolepsis, negotiated identity positioning, taking on roles of agency and purpose, and working in a borderland that hybridizes culture. Interpretive case studies focusing on such trajectories of identification were conducted in a program combining an out-of-school science and engineering learning environment with an outreach workplace for high school aged youth. The cases show the promise and pitfalls of the program's attempts to position the youth along positive trajectories. (Contains 1 note.)",

Although past research has documented sex differences in college pathways, little research has investigated the underlying causes of this variation. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study, this study empirically tests leading hypotheses for why men are more likely than women to progress through college discontinuously and part-time. This study finds that high school academic performance, which indicates preparation for college, accounts for part of the male-female gap in college pathways. Poorer academic performance at the beginning of college further increases the likelihood that men, relative to women, will disrupt their college experience.

        "description":"This study examines trends in American students' growth trajectories in reading and math achievement over the past three decades. Drawing upon multiple sources of national assessment data, cohort analyses provide new evidence on the stability and change of national academic growth curves. The emerging trends imply a tripartite pattern where American students are gaining ground at the pre/early primary school level, holding ground at the middle school level, and losing ground at the high school level. National progress in reading and math achievement at the pre/early primary school level appears to be offset by declines at the high school level. The study discusses the limitations and challenges of tracking academic growth trajectories across all different levels of education over the long term. It also calls for national P-16 education policy and research efforts toward sustainable academic growth and seamless educational transition. (Contains 3 tables, 6 figures, and 14 notes.)",

Using nationally representative data and three-level hierarchical linear models, this study explored the links between teacher perceptions and children's sociodemographic backgrounds. The authors find that teachers perceive substantial racial-ethnic, socioeconomic, and gender differences in children's literacy skills. Roughly half of these disparities are explained by actual between-group differences. The remaining perceptual inaccuracies flow more from classroom characteristics than from teachers' professional or personal backgrounds (e.g., their own race or ethnicity). Specifically, holding students' social and academic backgrounds constant, the authors find that teachers in lower-socioeconomic-status and lower-achieving contexts more often underestimate their students' abilities. These results highlight the importance of recent policy efforts to avoid isolating traditionally disadvantaged children. (Contains 5 tables.)",

A total of 60 target words were selected from the glossaries of basal readers, and two test forms of 30 words each were created with four illustrations per word plate. Rasch analyses carried out on the entire preschool sample and on separate samples of DLLs and MELs showed that the ranking of target words by difficulty was similar for DLLs and MELs, but the groups differed in mastery of target words. Language status and level of general vocabulary knowledge were stronger predictors of word difficulty than age for this sample of preschoolers. Findings suggest MELs and DLLs learn English words in a similar order, but further research is needed to support this conclusion. (Contains 3 tables, 9 figures, and 1 note.)",

Additionally, teachers' assessments of males and females are compared. The authors find no math gender gap in kindergarten, except at the top of the distribution; however, females throughout the distribution lose ground in elementary school and regain some in middle school. In reading, gaps favoring females generally narrow but widen among low-achieving students. However, teachers consistently rate females higher than males in both subjects, even when cognitive assessments suggest that males have an advantage.

I argue that the media advanced academic messages about kindergarten before state activism, while the state later embedded an academic model in policy.

Treatment and control conditions were randomly assigned to 63 teachers and 1,192 second through fifth grade students across five elementary schools. Using multilevel modeling, significant differences favoring the SEM-R were found in reading fluency in two schools (Cohen's \"d\" effect sizes of 0.33 and 0.10) and in reading comprehension in the high-poverty urban school (Cohen's \"d\" = 0.27), with no achievement differences in the remaining schools. These results demonstrate that an enrichment reading approach, with differentiated instruction and less whole group instruction, was as effective as or more effective than a traditional whole group basal approach.

Drawing from a qualitative study of young children's (ages 3.5 to 5.5) day-to-day experiences with racial and ethnic diversity in an early childhood classroom, this article takes a critical sociocultural approach to examine children's language and social interactions. Classroom participant observation and interviews with six focal students revealed children actively constructing understandings by appropriating various social tools. The children in this study enacted racial and ethnic identities, constructed theories about how differences operate, formed peer groups, and made sense of the multitude of messages they received about diversity.

        "description":"This study explores the nature of reading comprehension difficulties among early adolescent language minority (LM) learners and native English speakers in urban schools. Sixth-grade students (399 LM learners, 182 native English speakers) were screened for difficulties, using a standardized measure of reading comprehension. Of these, 262 students (201 LM learners, 61 native English speakers) with a score at or below the 35th percentile were administered measures of oral language and reading. More LM learners than their peers were classified as struggling readers (60% vs. 40%, respectively). However, latent class analysis demonstrated that the two populations were evenly distributed among three skill profiles of struggling readers. Despite relative differences in word reading accuracy and fluency, each profile was characterized by low vocabulary knowledge. The majority of struggling readers were found to have developed basic fluency skills. The findings demonstrate the need for middle schools to identify why students are having comprehension difficulties and to target instruction to meet their specific needs, given the wide variation in the struggling reader population. Moreover, they suggest that treating LM learners as a separate group based on their status as second-language learners may not be appropriate. (Contains 4 tables, 1 figure and 6 notes.)",

The authors' analyses of nationally representative data from multiple sources show that math and science are the fields most difficult to staff, but the factors behind these problems are complex. There are multiple sources of new teachers; those with education degrees are a minor source compared to those with degrees in math and science and the reserve pool. Over the past two decades, graduation requirements, student course taking, and teacher retirements have all increased for math and science, yet the new supply has more than kept pace. However, when preretirement teacher attrition is factored in, there is a much tighter balance between supply and demand. Unlike fields such as English, for math and science, there is not a large cushion of new supply relative to losses--resulting in staffing problems in schools with higher turnover.

When deciding to favor or reject higher education policies, people use prototypical ways of thinking, involving unconscious reaction and comprehension. This research uses Rosch's and Lakoff's notions of prototypes and Fairclough's critical discourse analysis as the main tools for understanding the prototypes for the conceptual category institutions of higher education. The data for this study come from a sample of all the higher education editorials and opinion articles (1,000 pieces) published over 26 years in three influential U.S. newspapers. Three higher education prototypes are identified and their elements described: academic nostalgia (present but not dominant), educational entrepreneurship (dominant, both positive and negative), and redemptive educational-consumerism (emerging).

Specifically, the authors focus on how teacher capacity (their level of education, experience, and knowledge) and their use of curriculum influence instruction. The study sample is 48 teachers implementing two standards-based mathematics curricula--&quot;Everyday Mathematics&quot; and &quot;Investigations&quot;--in two school districts. The data include interviews and surveys with teachers, as well as observations of instruction, over a 2-year period. Findings indicate that teachers' implementation of &quot;Investigations&quot; was considerably better than teachers' implementation of &quot;Everyday Mathematics&quot; in terms of maintaining high levels of cognitive demand, attention to student thinking, and mathematical reasoning. These implementation measures were not correlated to measures of teacher capacity across school districts. However, implementation measures were significantly correlated with teachers' lesson preparation that took into account the big mathematical ideas within curriculum. Further qualitative analysis indicated that the &quot;Investigations&quot; curriculum provided more support to teachers for locating and understanding the big mathematical ideas within lessons compared to &quot;Everyday Mathematics&quot;.

The results also indicated that students' perceptions of the distinct dimensions of school environment in seventh grade contribute differentially to the three types of school engagement in eighth grade. Finally, the authors found that students' perceptions of school environment influenced their academic achievement directly and indirectly through the three types of school engagement. Specifically, students' perceptions of school characteristics in seventh grade influenced their school participation, identification with school, and use of self-regulation strategies in eighth grade that occur therein and, in turn, influenced students' academic achievement in eighth grade.

Trustee independence is increasingly threatened, however, as the university becomes more deeply embedded in government, industry, networks, and the professions. This topic is investigated through analysis of qualitative interviews, focus group observations, and informant-produced documents from 59 public university presidents. It is argued that threats to trustee independence are produced primarily through a process of moral seduction that allows trustees to engage in self-interested decision making while maintaining an ethical self-concept. The article then provides a conceptual model to frame our understanding of how important social actors seek to capture and co-opt boards of trustees to serve external interests and describes how the institutional mechanism of moral seduction creates important policy considerations.

Participants were lead and assistant teachers in 44 Head Start classrooms. Teachers received 4 days of workshop training along with weekly in-class support from a mentor teacher. End-of-year observations indicated that compared with the control group, intervention teachers talked with children more frequently and in more cognitively complex ways, established a more positive classroom climate, and used more preventive behavior-management strategies. Results supported the conclusion that enriched curriculum components and professional development support can produce improvements in multiple domains of teaching quality. (Contains 5 tables.)",

Phase 1 produced no differences in achievement between experimental and comparable schools. During Phase 2, experimental group scores improved at a faster rate than at comparable schools and exhibited greater achievement growth over 3 years on state-mandated tests and an achievement index. Stable school-based settings, distributed leadership, and explicit protocols are key to effective teacher teams.

This article explores whether the capacity of states to employ different proficiency standards imposes different performance standards across demographic groups. Using a newly devised metric that allows for interstate comparison of state-level proficiency cut scores, along with aggregated district-level demographic data, this article provides a descriptive analysis of the distribution of proficiency standards across demographic groups to determine whether some groups systematically face higher or lower proficiency cut scores. The findings indicate that while an &quot;expectations gap&quot; does exist, it does not operate consistently across categories of race, ethnicity, and poverty status. The article concludes by reviewing the trade-offs required under three possible policy responses to these findings. (Contains 3 figures, 6 tables and 6 notes.)",

The approaches all advocate learners' active attitude toward the learning material but show differences in the specific learning processes they intend to foster. Learning results were measured on different types of knowledge: conceptual, intuitive, procedural, and situational. The outcomes show that the two approaches asking learners to generate (parts of) the subject matter (either by self-explanations or by conducting experiments) led to better performance on all types of knowledge. However, results also show that emphasis on generating subject matter by the learner resulted in less efficient learning. (Contains 12 tables and 2 figures.)",

In this article, the author draws on theories of organizational innovation and learning to reveal how central office administrators participate in these change processes, what outcomes are associated with their efforts, and the conditions that help or hinder their work. The data came from a 3-year qualitative investigation of these dynamics in two districts. The results show that particular bridging and buffering activities by certain central office administrators were consistent with policy goals and linked to increasing district supports for implementation.

However, the relationship between parental involvement and widespread benefit was mediated by parents' own goals and perspectives as well as by the larger social context. Furthermore, compared to a more individualistic approach to parental involvement, a collective orientation is more sustainable and has greater potential for benefiting all children in the school, without regard to their social class.

Consideration of racial diversity extended beyond student composition and included social and curricular engagement. Results suggest that benefits associated with diversity may be more far-reaching than previously documented. Not only do students benefit from engaging with racial diversity through related knowledge acquisition or cross-racial interaction but also from being enrolled on a campus where other students are more engaged with those forms of diversity, irrespective of their own level of engagement.

        "description":"Arising from a longitudinal study examining the influence of school reform on teachers' knowledge communities and communities of knowing, this narrative inquiry traces the development of a workshop approach to reading and writing, principally through the introduction of a staff developer, to the school's professional knowledge landscape and to the literacy teachers' curriculum making over a 3-year period. While some of the school administrators perceived the trainer as building professional learning community through sharing knowledge, skills, and dispositions, the majority of the teachers, and some of the other administrators, appeared to view the staff developer, herself a teacher, as being in collusion with the principal (and vice versa) and as crossing the line concerning what teachers and their communities of knowing are able to tolerate. Different stories produced different visions of community, and a number of issues related to teacher development emerged. Disconnects among theory, practice, and policy surfaced.

Organizational variables within these schools may buffer community influences. Nine &quot;atypical&quot; schools are selected from a national database in Israel. Three years of intense qualitative and quantitative methods are employed at these schools. The most important variable found is the leadership of the principal. These schools emphasize a school reform approach rather than packaged school violence evidence-based programs. The schools demonstrate &quot;outward&quot; oriented ideologies, a schoolwide awareness of violence, consistent procedures, integrated use of cultural and religious symbols, visual manifestations of student care, and the beautification of school grounds.

In Experiment 1, undergraduates had the task of explaining what caused the eruption of Mt. St. Helens using the results of an Internet search. Multiple regression analyses indicated that source evaluation significantly predicted learning outcomes, with more successful learners better able to discriminate scientifically reliable from unreliable information. In Experiment 2, an instructional unit (SEEK) taught undergraduates how to evaluate the reliability of information sources. Undergraduates who used SEEK while working on an inquiry task about the Atkins low-carbohydrate diet displayed greater differentiation in their reliability judgments of information sources than a comparison group. Both groups then participated in the Mt. St. Helens task. Undergraduates in the SEEK conditions demonstrated better learning from the volcano task. The current studies indicate that the evaluation of information sources is critical to successful learning from Internet-based inquiry and amenable to improvement through instruction.

        "description":"Although a rich tradition of mainly U.S. and U.K. research focuses on the nature and effects of tracking students within schools, little research has investigated the importance of tracking students in the same or in separate schools. The authors used data from a unique, representative survey in Flanders (Belgium) to examine how students' study involvement varied between multilateral schools (in which all different tracks are offered) and categorial schools (in which only particular tracks are offered) and whether the relation between track and study involvement varied between these school types. Multilevel analyses of data gathered in 2004 and 2005 from academic and vocational third and fifth grade students in a sample of Flemish secondary schools showed that vocational students had slightly lower study involvement in multilateral schools. Although academic students were more study involved than vocational students, this difference was larger in multilateral schools than in categorial schools. The data suggest that in multilateral schools, vocational students compared themselves with academic-track students, consistent with the hypothesis of increased status deprivation, resulting in even stronger antischool attitudes. The implications of these findings for further research and social policy are discussed. (Contains 7 tables, 1 figure and 1 note.)",

This study identifies reasons for this sorting of teachers by surveying 531 teachers in a California elementary school district. The surveys ask the teachers to make choices between various workplace characteristics. With this information, the study disentangles student demographics from other characteristics of teaching jobs that are amenable to policy influences. It finds that teachers identify working conditions--particularly, school facilities, administrative support, and class sizes--and salaries as significantly more important than student characteristics when selecting a school in which to work.

Through meta-level narrative analysis, excerpts from several accounts that elucidate different manifestations of the contested classroom space in multiple school contexts are woven together. In the process, the ways that teachers, principals, parents, professors, consultants, district personnel, the media, researchers, and students contributed to the contentious environment are explicated. Also, versions of curriculum and instruction that increased the contestation are named. As a result, changes that teachers and students lived in classrooms from 1997 to 2007, the decade when educational policy making in Texas served as the prototype for the U.S. No Child Left Behind Act, are characterized.",

The findings indicate that need-based aid and merit-based aid both have positive effects throughout college, and thus colleges may be able to use financial policy levers to increase academic achievement. However, since the effect of merit aid is larger than that of need-based aid, institutions may have incentives to reallocate aid and admissions spots from needy to merit students unless appropriate safeguards are adopted.

Participants from 291 sites (177 centers; 114 home-based) in four cities were randomly selected to: Group 1, 3-credit course in early language and literacy; Group 2, course plus ongoing coaching; Group 3, control group. Analysis of covariance indicated no significant differences between groups on teacher knowledge. However, there were statistically significant improvements in language and literacy practices for teachers who received coursework plus coaching with substantial effect sizes for both center- and home-based providers. Professional development alone had negligible effects on improvements in quality practices. Coursework and coaching may represent a promising quality investment in early childhood.

        "description":"The authors investigate how conversational routines, or the practices by which groups structure work-related talk, function in teacher professional communities to forge, sustain, and support learning and improvement. Audiotaped and videotaped records of teachers' work group interactions, supplemented by interviews and material artifacts, were collected as part of a 2-year project centered on teacher learning and collegiality at two urban high schools. This analysis focuses on two teacher work groups within the same school. While both groups were committed to improvement and shared a common organizational context, their characteristic conversational routines provided different resources for them to access, conceptualize, and learn from problems of practice. More specifically, the groups differed in the extent to which conversational routines supported the linking of frameworks for teaching to specific instances of practice. An analysis of the broader data set points to significant contextual factors that help account for the differences in the practices of the two groups. The study has implications for fostering workplace learning through more systematic support of professional community. (Contains 11 notes and 15 excerpts.)",

        "description":"This article reports on research with one Black male elementary school teacher in Toronto and draws on feminist, queer, and antiracist analytic perspectives to raise important questions about the discourse of teachers as role models. The voice of this teacher is used to challenge discourses about role modeling in their capacity to address adequately the limits imposed by both cultural and structural problems experienced by minority boys in urban school communities. Important questions about the role of teachers as transformative or organic intellectuals are also raised. A case study approach is employed to draw attention to both important pedagogical issues and the limits of role modeling as a conceptual framework that continues to be used to support generalizable claims about the influence of male teachers on the basis of their gender and racial affiliation with boys in schools. What is required, the authors conclude, is a disarticulation and, hence, a separating out of role modeling from a discussion about the need for a greater representation of minority teachers in urban schools.",

The authors find that licensure tests have different predicative validity for student achievement by teacher race. They also find that student achievement is impacted by the race/ethnicity match between teachers and their students, with Black students significantly benefitting from being matched with a Black teacher. As a consequence of these matching effects, the uniform application of licensure standards is likely to have differential impacts on the achievement of White and minority students.

The author examined instead how the teacher and students in a low-track mathematics classroom jointly constructed opposition through their classroom interactions. Analysis of the classroom interaction revealed the emergence and escalation of a number of classroom practices that became oppositional. These practices were related to the nature of the mathematical activity, the framing and positioning of student participation in this activity, and multiple interpretations of student competence in and out of the classroom. The author found that classroom opposition is fostered by weak opportunities for meaningful mathematical engagement and the transformation of a polarized participation structure into an oppositional one.

Statistically significant moderating effects emerged in both areas; however, in relation to the large sample (N = 265,180), many were considered small.

Such disparities were partially mediated by corresponding differences in children's socioemotional problems, parenting stress, and parents' human capital investments. These patterns appeared to be robust to observed and unobserved confounds. Various teacher qualifications and classroom practices were assessed as moderators of these family mediators, revealing teacher experience in grade level as a fairly consistent buffer against family-based risks for reading.

        "description":"Researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and parents have assumed a positive relationship between school attendance and academic success. And yet, among the vast body of empirical research examining how input factors relate to academic outcomes, few investigations have honed in on the precision of the relationship between individual attendance and student achievement. The purpose of this article is to provide insight into this relationship. Specifically, this study has evaluated the hypothesis that the number of days a student was present in school positively affected learning outcomes. To assess this, a unique empirical approach was taken in order to evaluate a comprehensive dataset of elementary and middle school students in the Philadelphia School District. Employing a fixed effects framework and instrumental variables strategy, this study provides evidence from a quasi-experimental design geared at estimating the causal impact of attendance on multiple measures of achievement, including GPA and standardized reading and math test performance. The results consistently indicate positive and statistically significant relationships between student attendance and academic achievement for both elementary and middle school students.

In the present study, whether the prejudiced attitudes of teachers relate to their expectations and the academic achievement of their students is examined. The prejudiced attitudes of 41 elementary school teachers were assessed via self-report and an Implicit Association Test. Teacher expectations and achievement scores for 434 students were obtained. Multilevel analyses showed no relations with the self-report measure of prejudiced attitudes. The implicit measure of teacher prejudiced attitudes, however, was found to explain differing ethnic achievement gap sizes across classrooms via teacher expectations. The results of this study also suggest that the use of implicit attitude measures may be important in educational research. (Contains 5 tables, 2 figures and 7 notes.)",

Ethnicity and parents' education level predicted rate of growth. Type and amount of reading instruction predicted children's reading scores. However, effects for type of instruction were time-sensitive, occurring only in kindergarten and first grade. Although children benefit from instruction in decoding and comprehension skills, instruction may not be optimally tailored to children most at risk. (Contains 9 tables, 2 figures and 1 note.)",

Each identity was explored within the context of the classroom, including efficacy for multicultural instruction, sense of responsibility for teaching about diverse people, and sense of advocacy for oppressed groups. The findings suggest preservice teachers hold a limited view of what constitutes diversity, which affects their senses of efficacy, responsibility, and advocacy as individuals and as teachers.

Thirty-one teachers each completed a brief science activity and accompanying worksheet with a student confederate. Teachers were given one of two goals for the study: help the students complete a worksheet or help the students learn more about science. The instructions had a significant effect on the teachers' responses to students' deviations. Teachers in the worksheet condition tended to discourage deviation and draw the students back to the task at hand, whereas teachers in the learn more condition were more likely to encourage and expand on the deviation. Apart from their responses to students' deviations, nearly all teachers were classified as encouraging, suggesting that an articulated goal for the activity has a particular effect on the response to deviations. Implications for the role of teachers in the development of children's curiosity are considered. (Contains 1 figure.)",

The purpose of this study was to examine the heuristics students use as they form their mathematics self-efficacy from these and other sources. Semistructured interviews were conducted with eight middle school students who reported either high or low self-efficacy and with students' parents and mathematics teachers. Students relied on information from all four hypothesized sources, which were combined according to various heuristics. Teaching structures, course placement, and students' self-regulated learning also emerged as important factors related to self-efficacy.

Though it is not their task to debate No Child Left Behind (NCLB), the authors locate their investigation inside the current policy context to which NCLB is attached. Specifically, they present their analysis through the organizational behavior lens of threat rigidity to discuss the ways that current federal and state policy contexts influence schools and how those affected schools in turn adopt corresponding reforms that influence teachers' work. The analysis demonstrates that on both levels, such influence occurs in similar ways: by centralizing and restricting the flow of information, by constricting control, by emphasizing routinized and simplified instructional/assessment practices, and by applying strong pressure for school personnel to conform.

It investigates long-term social and institutional effects of professional development and documents processes that facilitate teachers' continued learning. Data from a decade-long study of U.S. and South African teachers supported a model of generative change that explained how professional development could be internalized by teachers, subsequently serving as a heuristic to help them organize their individual programs of instruction. Drawing primarily on two case studies, this article documents teachers' development of generative knowledge and illustrates how they drew on that knowledge in thinking about students and teaching. The results were to facilitate generative thinking on the part of their students as well. (Contains 1 figure and 1 note.)",

They draw on both survey data and observational data to examine the nature of racial identity meanings for African American students, their relation to academic engagement and achievement, and how they were fostered by the school context. Findings show that students embraced (and were offered differential access to) different meanings of African American racial identity and that these meanings were differentially related to achievement and engagement.

Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we explore how having resource-rich best friends impacts adolescents' college completion. We compare the influence of friends' material and cultural resources and their effects relative to adolescents' family resources. We find that having a best friend with a college-educated mother significantly increases the likelihood of college completion, though having a best friend whose parents are high income does not. This positive effect of best friends' cultural resources is not explained fully by school achievement or by the expectations of respondents, best friends, or parents. We conclude that adolescent friendships are an underrecognized source of social capital. (Contains 5 tables and 14 notes.)",

Building a conceptual argument for identity trajectories, the authors discuss the ongoing, cumulative, and contentious nature of identity work and the mechanisms that foster critical shifts in trajectories. The authors argue that the girls view possible future selves in science when their identity work is recognized, supported, and leveraged toward expanded opportunities for engagement in science. This process yields layered meanings of (possible) selves and of science and reconfigures meaningful participation in science. (Contains 2 tables, 1 figure, and 1 note.)",

Using a unique identification strategy that employs school-by-grade level turnover and two classes of fixed-effects models, this study estimates the effects of teacher turnover on over 850,000 New York City fourth- and fifth-grade student observations over 8 years. The results indicate that students in grade levels with higher turnover score lower in both English language arts (ELA) and math and that these effects are particularly strong in schools with more low-performing and Black students. Moreover, the results suggest that there is a disruptive effect of turnover beyond changing the distribution in teacher quality. (Contains 3 figures, 17 tables, and 16 notes.)",

Tree thinking is indispensable in modern science.

Students' responses to questions assessing five tree-thinking skills provided evidence for several perceptual and conceptual factors that impact reasoning (e.g., the Gestalt principles of good continuation and spatial proximity, prior knowledge). Instructional implications of the results include using the tree format for initial instruction and clarifying that most recent common ancestry determines evolutionary relatedness. Broader implications for designing scientific diagrams and promoting diagrammatic literacy are considered. (Contains 7 figures, 4 tables, and 6 notes.)",

This analysis extends theory regarding the challenges of school change in disadvantaged contexts by illustrating how the internal resources that schools rely on to respond to external policy demands can be affected by the social contexts in which they are embedded. The article draws on data from a study of five high poverty high schools' responses to the pressures of Texas' high stakes accountability system. The case study data illustrate how a school's social context can precipitate instability in some schools and relative stability in others, how organizational stability in turn can affect schools' organizational social capital, and how organizational social capital can influence schools' ability to respond to external policy demands.

Pathway teachers learned how to use an on-demand writing assessment to help mainstreamed English learners understand, interpret, and write analytical essays. In Year 2, treatment effects were replicated on an on-demand writing assessment (d = 0.67) and showed evidence of transfer to improved performance on a standardized writing test (d = 0.10). The results underscore the efficacy of a cognitive strategies reading/writing intervention for mainstreamed English learners (ELs) in the secondary grades.

The author describes the curriculum and suggests how students' drawings and written commentaries can provide insights into students' preferred learning modalities, promote understanding of abstract concepts through visualization, and reveal students' preexisting attitudes toward science.

Employing hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), the authors were able to control for background characteristics at both the teacher and school levels. They found that 17% of the total variance in teacher job satisfaction is between schools, a statistically significant amount that indicates schools can make a difference in teacher job satisfaction. The authors found that school processes--particularly career and working conditions, staff collegiality, administrative support, and to a lesser extent, positive student behavior and teacher empowerment--are positively associated with teacher job satisfaction. Although two principal background variables--the experience of being a department head or an athletic coach/director--are statistically significant, the authors found the block of school process variables explains far more variance than the block of principal background variables. Based on the findings, the authors discussed issues such as the complexity of the phenomenon of teacher job satisfaction, the role of school process versus principal background, and monetary versus cultural factors.

However, whether switching schools actually puts youth at risk for dropout is uncertain, since youth who switch schools are similar to dropouts in their levels of prior school achievement and engagement, which suggests that switching schools may be part of the same long-term developmental process of disengagement that leads to dropping out. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, this study uses propensity score matching to pair youth who switched high schools with similar youth who stayed in the same school. We find that while over half the association between switching schools and dropout is explained by observed characteristics prior to ninth grade, switching schools is still associated with dropout. Moreover, the relationship between switching schools and dropout varies depending on a youth's propensity for switching schools. (Contains 3 figures, 4 tables and 13 notes.)",

Understanding those factors associated with the existence of a social tie among actors in schools is important because absent social ties, individuals do not have access to social resources. We investigate social tie formation in schools focusing on advice and information providing and receiving in the two core elementary school subjects. Using a multilevel p[subscript 2] model, we examine the role of both formal organizational structure and individual characteristics in shaping advice and information providing and receiving about instruction. Our findings suggest that while the individual characteristics of race and gender are significantly associated with the formation of a tie, aspects of the formal school organization--grade-level assignment, having a formally designated leadership position, and teaching a single grade--are also significant and have larger estimated effects than individual characteristics. Formal organizational factors trump individual characteristics in the formation of a social tie, a necessary if insufficient condition for social capital development.

Using a data set constructed from four nationally representative surveys (National Longitudinal Survey 1972, High School & Beyond 1980, National Educational Longitudinal Survey 1988, and Educational Longitudinal Survey 2002), the authors model how escalating admissions standards--including academic preparation and the growing importance of SAT scores and extracurricular leadership--effectively maintain racial inequality in selective college enrollment over time. Black and Latino students have made strides in their pre-collegiate academic preparation. Nevertheless, although access to postsecondary education has expanded since 1972 for all ethnic groups, Black and Latino students' odds of selective college enrollment have declined relative to White and Asian American students.

Analyses also examine the different comparative advantages men and women enjoy in math/science versus English/reading. Regardless of how prior achievement is measured, very little of the strong and persistent gender gap in physical science and engineering majors over time is explained. Findings highlight the limitations of theories focusing on gender differences in skills and suggest directions for future research. (Contains 2 figures, 2 tables and 13 notes.)",

This study identifies factors contributing to superintendent turnover in California by matching original superintendent and school board survey data with administrative data and information hand-collected from news sources on why superintendents left and where they went. Among 215 superintendents studied beginning in 2006, 45% exited within 3 years. Using a multinomial framework to separate retirements from other turnover, the authors find that factors such as how highly the school board rates its own functioning and the superintendent's performance and whether the superintendent was hired internally strongly predict non-retirement exits 3 years later. Short-term district test score growth, however, is uncorrelated. Superintendents who move migrate away from rural districts toward larger, higher-paying districts in urban and suburban locations.

Parallel themes within the two texts are analyzed and interpreted as suggesting that narcissistic psychological processes played a part in distorting teachers' personalities in the 1930s. Role expectations and tasks associated with being a teacher, it is suggested, reinforced a narcissistic pattern of behavior that influenced identity formation and teacher stereotypes.

        "description":"A randomized controlled trial was used to evaluate the effects of a supplemental mathematics intervention that emphasized fluency building for computations and procedures. All fourth- and fifth-grade English-speaking students from a single school district who were participating in general education mathematics instruction and had a 2009 year-end accountability score were included in the study (N = 537). Assignment to intervention or control conditions occurred at the classroom level with roughly half of classes being assigned to intervention and half being assigned to control conditions within each school. Outcome measures included the 2009 year-end statewide accountability measure in mathematics as well as three computation curriculum-based measurement probes of mathematics administered on three occasions during the school year. Implementation integrity data were collected in intervention classrooms via direct observation, teacher surveys, and monitoring of permanent products. Multilevel linear modeling (MLM) analysis was used to evaluate the effect of the intervention on student mathematics outcomes for all students and for students who were low performing at baseline. Intervention effects were detected at both grade levels (but not on all outcome measures). MLM was also used to evaluate the mediating effect of intervention implementation integrity on intervention effects. The integrity with which the intervention was implemented in intervention classrooms predicted end-of-year standardized measures of mathematics achievement and growth on curriculum-based measures. Implications for mathematics instruction in general and mathematics intervention within response to intervention models are discussed. (Contains 2 figures and 9 tables.)",

Framed by an ethnographic, embedded case study design, the authors collected data from 32 Latino parents. The findings detail parents' experiences when first entering the neighborhood and how these experiences shape their engagement with other parents in the program and neighborhood community. We conclude that efforts engaging low-income parents as communities of practice hold special promise for reducing barriers to children's learning, especially when school leaders, community-based organizations, and social researchers leverage their resources and capital in ways that support parents' efforts, insights, and aspirations.

However, low-income Korean Americans are more likely than low-income Chinese Americans to take SAT prep, although both communities have extensive ethnic economies. In the analysis of a national dataset of first-year college students, religious affiliation and religious service attendance were positively associated with SAT prep for Korean Americans, while low socioeconomic status and lack of citizenship discouraged participation for Chinese Americans. I argue that immigrant churches facilitate interclass contact for Korean Americans, which encourages the flow of information around educational resources. Findings demonstrate how what is often stereotyped as &quot;Asian culture&quot; is in reality shaped by complex structural factors. (Contains 1 note and 3 tables.)",

Using a case study of fifth-grade girls, the authors compare their experiences to research examining secondary school.

The authors also notice two additional dimensions--the need to engage in discourse that allows an exchange of diverse ideas while working toward a common goal. The authors also observed the emergence of civic efficacy, or a belief that one can make a difference in their social worlds. The authors also examine the contexts and conditions that support positive youth development in this case--scaffolding youth learning, establishing inquiry as the framework for teaching and learning, and establishing a clear vision of the school as a place that fosters student voice.

Relationships between the ability to manage emotions, measured with a situational judgment test, and indicators of social adaptation to school remained significant or marginally significant after controlling for demographic factors, personality traits, and indicators of cognitive ability. These findings suggest that emotion regulation knowledge and skills that can be taught explain important aspects of socio-emotional adaptation to school over and above other relevant constructs.

Between 1982 and 2004, for example, the proportion of high school graduates who earned credit in precalculus or calculus more than tripled. In this article, the authors investigate the consequences of mathematics curricular intensification for social stratification in American high schools. Using representative data from U.S. high school graduates in 1982, 1992, and 2004, the authors estimate changes in race-, class-, and skills-based inequality in advanced math course credit completion. Their analyses indicate that race, class, and skills gaps in geometry, Algebra II, and trigonometry completion have narrowed considerably over the study period. However, consistent with the theory of maximally maintained inequality, inequalities in calculus completion remain pronounced. (Contains 6 tables and 13 notes.)",

Yet, research on school context continues to rely upon a traditional, cross-sectional bifurcation that designates schools as either diverse or not. This classification may be especially inaccurate for some educational outcomes such as whether schools are cultivating effective citizenship for a diverse democracy. Because of changing demographics, this paper considers whether a new framework for conceptualizing school racial composition, including the number and identity of specific racial groups and the stability of those groups, can determine more precisely the ways in which school diversity impacts students' citizenship learning.

        "description":"Low participation rates in the study of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) post-16 are a matter of international concern. Existing evidence suggests children's science aspirations are largely formed within the critical 10 to 14 age period. This article reports on survey data from over 9,000 elementary school children in England (age 10/11) and qualitative data from 160 semi-structured interviews (92 children aged 10/11 and 78 parents), collected as part of an ongoing 5-year longitudinal study in the United Kingdom tracking children from 10 to 14. Drawing on the conceptual framework of Bourdieu, the article explores how the interplay of family habitus and capital can make science aspirations more &quot;thinkable&quot; for some (notably middle-class) children than others. It is argued that while family habitus is not deterministic (there is no straightforward alignment between family habitus, capital, and a child's science aspirations), social inequalities in the distribution of capital and differentially classed family habitus combine to produce uneven (classed, racialized) patterns in children's science aspirations and potential future participation.

In contrast, this study looks specifically at career decisions coupled with practice. Guided by a view of teaching as social and cultural practice, the study used multiple qualitative data sources, including extensive observations, interviews, and samples of teachers' and students' work. Based on within- and cross-case analysis of 15 cases at four distinct time points within a 5-year period, the authors identified multiple patterns of teaching practice linked to early career decisions, which reflect considerable variation in quality of teaching and career trajectory. The authors argue that \"stayers\" and \"leavers\" are not homogeneous groups, as is often assumed in research and policy. Rather, there are multiple variations of practice coupled with career decisions, some desirable and others not, with different implications for policy and practice.

Through the boys' direct voices about their schooling experiences with a particular focus on the middle and high school years in the United States, this article reports on the complexities of their identity negotiation and the process of their self-positioning and interactive positioning. This longitudinal study suggests that, rather than a single focus on language or culture, the immigrant students' critical awareness of identity, negotiated identities, and external confirmation of unique abilities enable them to construct and reconstruct the context that contributes to their success.

Using hierarchical linear modeling, the authors analyzed two separate models. One model predicted enrollment in an HSI within the 2-year sector and one within the 4-year sector. Distinct predictors of HSI versus non-HSI enrollment were found, particularly for the 4-year sector.

Characterized as a tactical response to ubiquitous forms of racism and racialized experiences across school and non-school contexts, stereotype management emerged along overlapping paths of racial, gender, and mathematics identity development. Interviews revealed that although stereotype management facilitated success in these domains, the students maintained an intense and perpetual state of awareness that their racial identities and Blackness are undervalued and constantly under assault within mathematics and engineering contexts. With age development and maturity, the students progressed from being preoccupied with attempts to prove stereotypes wrong to adopting more self-defined reasons to achieve. The results suggest that stereotype threat is not deterministic. (Contains 3 notes and 2 tables.)",

Although ample support was provided for the I/E model by cross-sectional data and for the REM within a single domain, there has been almost no research on the longitudinal generalizability of the reciprocal cross-domain effects. Using three waves of data collection from Grade 5 to Grade 8 with N = 1,508 students, analyses supported the validity of the RI/EM, revealing positive longitudinal effects of grades and ASCs on subsequent grades and ASCs within domains and negative effects of grades on subsequent ASCs across domains.

Data include pre- and posttest essays, interviews, observations, teacher feedback, assignments, and readings. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of 42 students' work show that one class improved in writing evidence-based history essays whereas the other did not. Qualitative analyses of the teachers' practices suggest that different opportunities to learn to read, write, and think historically are not equally valuable. In particular, the following qualities of instruction support students' development in writing evidence-based historical essays: approaching history as evidence-based interpretation; reading historical texts and considering them as interpretations; supporting reading comprehension and historical thinking; asking students to develop interpretations and support them with evidence; and using direct instruction, guided practice, independent practice, and feedback to teach evidence-based writing. The act of writing alone is not sufficient for growth in evidence-based historical writing. (Contains 8 tables, 5 figures, and 3 notes.)",

The findings revealed that students in all four programs (treatment TBE, control TBE, treatment SEI, and control SEI) improved significantly (p less than 0.05) in a linear pattern over 2 years, and students receiving the intervention developed at a faster rate than those receiving typical instruction (p less than 0.05, effect sizes greater than 0.46). The authors concluded that (a) first-language instruction did not impede the learning of a second language, and (b) enhancements and best practices in TBE and SEI programs are needed to accelerate oral English acquisition to remove the initial disadvantage of low levels of English proficiency.

Previous research has shown the importance of English language proficiency in predicting academic achievement measured by GPA and achievement tests. The present study describes the academic English language proficiency of immigrant youth after, on average, 7 years in the United States and models factors that contribute to variation. Findings show that although differences in individual student characteristics partially explain variation in English language proficiency, the schools that immigrant youth attended are also important. The amount of time that students spent speaking English in informal social situations is predictive of English language proficiency. These findings demonstrate that social context factors directly affect language learning among adolescent immigrant youth and suggest a crucial role for school and peer interventions.

        "description":"The study of preservice elementary teachers' knowledge of fractions is important because fractions are notoriously difficult to learn and teach. Unfortunately, studies of preservice teachers' fraction knowledge are limited and have focused primarily on division. The present study included all four operations to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this knowledge. Because knowledge is complex, it was examined in five ways: computational skill, basic concepts, word problems, flexibility, and transfer. To further capture the complexity of knowledge, solution methods were examined for patterns that might reveal understandings and misconceptions. Data were gathered before and after a course designed to deepen preservice teachers' knowledge. Quantitative and qualitative shifts occurred during the semester, but flexibility and transfer were low. Implications for teacher education are discussed. (Contains 6 tables, 1 figure, and 1 note.)",

Student- and class-level predictors of homework interest were analyzed in a survey of 1,046 8th graders from 63 classes and of 849 11th graders from 48 classes. Most of the variance in homework interest occurred at the student level, with grade level appearing as the only significant predictor at the class level. At the student level, the variation in homework interest was positively associated with affective attitude toward homework, motivational orientation toward homework, student initiative in monitoring homework motivation, teacher feedback, and self-reported grade. Girls reported statistically significant higher scores in homework interest than did boys. (Contains 4 tables and 1 note.)",

Ethnographic data are collected over 18 months, and the investigation is guided by structuration theory. The strength of using structuration theory is that it opens up the possibility for exploring how students form decisions while taking into consideration how the students' social and cultural contexts influence their choices. The study shows that students do not follow a conventional path to college, a path that often conflicts with their own cultural values. Implications for this study indicate that educational institutions must learn more about the culture and worldviews of Mexican immigrants to create more effective paths to higher education.

Enrollment trends are analyzed in the context of contemporary social, legal, and educational policy initiatives intended to desegregate dual systems of public higher education. Despite more than 50 years of desegregation litigation, findings show that enrollment by race across institutional sectors remains considerably segregated. White enrollment at historically Black colleges and universities remains minuscule. Black enrollment at predominantly White institutions has increased noticeably in Mississippi but less so in North Carolina. The discussion is dedicated to understanding what factors most significantly influence policy efforts and distinguishing the notion of integration from desegregation mandates.

Collectively, the participants' counterstories revealed that each had acquired a robust mathematics identity as a component of his overall efforts toward success. How the participants acquired such \"uncharacteristic\" mathematics identities was to be found in part in how they understood sociocultural discourses of U.S. society and how they negotiated the specific discourses that surround male African Americans. Present throughout the counterstories of each participant was a recognition of himself as a discursive formation who could negotiate sociocultural discourses as a means to subversively repeat his constituted \"raced\" self.

Findings indicate that racism and sexism influence whether and how Black faculty members mentor in unique ways. Women engage in close, personal relationships and face high gender-based expectations regarding student contact, leading to their carriage of a heavy mentoring burden.

The authors examined implicit math attitudes and stereotypes among a heterogeneous sample of 5,139 participants. Women showed stronger implicit negativity toward math than men did and equally strong implicit gender stereotypes. For women, stronger implicit math=male stereotypes predicted greater negativity toward math, less participation, weaker self-ascribed ability, and worse math achievement; for men, those relations were weakly in the opposite direction. Implicit stereotypes had greater predictive validity than explicit stereotypes. Female STEM majors, especially those with a graduate degree, held weaker implicit math=male stereotypes and more positive implicit math attitudes than other women. Implicit measures will be a valuable tool for education research and help account for unexplained variation in the STEM sex gap. (Contains 8 notes, 1 figure, and 5 tables.)",

This study draws on unique data combining survey responses from principals, assistant principals, teachers, and parents with rich administrative data to determine which principal skills correlate most highly with school outcomes. Factor analysis of a 42-item task inventory distinguishes five skill categories, yet only one of them, the principals' Organization Management skills, consistently predicts student achievement growth and other success measures. Analysis of evaluations of principals by assistant principals supports this central result. The analysis argues for a broad view of principal leadership that includes organizational management skills as a key complement to the work of supporting curriculum and instruction.

        "author":["Maralani, Vida"],
        "description":"Age patterns of secondary certification and college entry differ in complex and surprising ways for traditional graduates and GED recipients. Although GED recipients are less likely to enter college in their late teens, they catch up to traditional graduates in their 20s. Results show that adjusting for differences in the age trajectories of school continuation accounts for a substantial portion of the differences observed between the two groups. Important differences remain, however, in the type of college attended and the likelihood of college entry before age 21. Nonetheless, more GED recipients enroll in college than previous studies have suggested, and this interest in college identifies a useful place for policy to intervene to encourage school continuation for this group.

Reported here is a highly controlled experimental study of PBL in a middle school population. Between- and within-subject comparisons are made of students learning the same material under three instructional conditions: lecture/discussion, characteristic small-group PBL, and solitary PBL. Assessments of comprehension and application of concepts in a new context 9 weeks after instruction showed superior mastery in both PBL conditions, relative to the lecture condition, and equivalent performance in the two PBL conditions, the latter indicating that the social component of PBL is not a critical feature of its effectiveness.

Piecewise growth modeling was used to compare English reading growth trajectories for native English speakers and LM learners of differing initial English proficiency, with and without controlling for socioeconomic status. LM learners who enter kindergarten fluent in English catch up with native English speakers nationally by first grade and maintain nationally average levels through eighth grade.

While scholars have focused attention on some aspects of their validity (e.g., scoring procedures), others have received less scrutiny. This article focuses on the extent to which value-added scores correspond to other indicators of teacher and teaching quality. The authors compared 24 middle school mathematics teachers' value-added scores, derived from a large (N = 222) district data set, to survey- and observation-based indicators of teacher quality, instruction, and student characteristics. This analysis found teachers' value-added scores correlated not only with their mathematical knowledge and quality of instruction but also with the population of students they teach. Case studies illustrate problems that might arise in using value-added scores in pay-for-performance plans. (Contains 7 notes, 7 tables and 1 figure.)",

The intervention consisted of 10 days of professional development in Reading Apprenticeship, an instructional framework integrating metacognitive inquiry routines into subject-area instruction to make explicit the tacit reasoning processes, problem-solving strategies, and textual features that shape literacy practices in academic disciplines. The study utilized a group-randomized, experimental design and multiple measures of teacher implementation and student learning and targeted groups historically unrepresented in the sciences. Hierarchical linear modeling procedures were used to estimate program impacts. Intervention teachers demonstrated increased support for science literacy learning and use of metacognitive inquiry routines, reading comprehension instruction, and collaborative learning structures compared to controls. Students in treatment classrooms performed better than controls on state standardized assessments in English language arts, reading comprehension, and biology.

Teachers enacted strategies in their classrooms, were observed and interviewed, and discussed and reflected on results during monthly meetings. Enactment of motivation strategies was related to changes in mathematics instruction for some teachers. Results reflect the importance of situating motivation strategies in content area instruction and providing adequate support for teacher conceptual change. The authors examine both personal and contextual explanations for changing instructional practices and the obstacles to such changes. (Contains 1 note and 3 tables.)",

Data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study and the Census show that students from minority-concentrated schools attain less education in the long run than students from White-concentrated schools net of many covariates. Both normative processes and frog-pond processes (especially from class rank) help explain attainment, but they tend to cancel each other out and make the net effect of peers in minority and white concentrated schools small.

Students had higher achievement test scores in more diverse schools, especially when they also had more same-race/ethnicity peers in these diverse schools. These patterns were particularly strong for White students. Having more school peers of the same race/ethnicity, regardless of the overall level of diversity in the school, was associated with positive socioemotional development.

If a teacher had an uneven number of classes, we assigned extra classes to treatment. The total number of classes randomized was 61, with 34 treatment and 27 comparison. Treatment students received a multicomponent reading comprehension instruction (collaborative strategic reading) from their English/language arts/reading teachers that included teaching students to apply comprehension strategies in collaborative groups for 18 weeks, with approximately two sessions per week.

School climate surveys completed by 5,035 ninth grade students measured characteristics of authoritative schools, defined as highly supportive, yet highly structured with academic and behavioral expectations. Multivariate analyses showed that schools low on characteristics of an authoritative school had the highest schoolwide suspension rates for Black and White students after statistically controlling for school demographics. Furthermore, schools low on both structure and support had the largest racial discipline gaps. These findings highlight the characteristics of risky settings that may not meet the developmental needs of adolescents and may contribute to disproportionate disciplinary outcomes for Black students.

With the instructional practices of eight exemplary African American elementary teachers serving their investigative site, they begin to develop a theory for promoting student interest in science. They argue that this emerging theory is distinguishable by three broad propositions: having a genuine interest, scaffolding student interest, and offering multiple standpoints. They further show that their theory based on these three related propositions has provided an important framework to better understand a number of important issues in science education (e.g., early interest in science and hands-on science activities).

The study is based on interviews with 13 urban youth about their participation in a community-based program that supports education organizing. Findings reveal that school activism is a promising intervention that encourages more constructive responses to schooling. However, the opportunity to participate in school activism was more influential for students who were already integrated into school life and initially felt less acutely alienated. Implications for enhancing the prevalence of success among urban students are considered. (Contains 2 notes and 5 tables.)",

But courts can be expected to protect rights only within boundaries shaped in part by popular and political opinion. This suggests that litigation outcomes regarding education rights issues will depend on shifting the policymaking context through broad societal changes in perspective about the importance of equitable schooling. This dynamic of courts carrying out their limited countermajoritarian role within contextual constraints has substantial implications concerning the largely unrealized capacity of social science to affect judicial decision making. Accordingly, this article explores that dynamic and those implications, building on existing concepts from political science scholarship and introducing the concept of a zone of judicial constraints.

Results showed that rural students were more advantaged in community social resources compared to nonrural students, and these resources were associated with a significant increase in the likelihood of bachelor's degree attainment. Yet results confirmed that rural students lagged behind nonrural students in attaining a bachelor's degree largely due to their lower socioeconomic background. The findings present a more comprehensive picture of the complexity of geographic residence in shaping college enrollment and degree attainment. (Contains 5 tables and 10 notes.)",

Despite the fact that families' decisions are critical to the successful implementation of educational programs, however, few studies examine their sense-making processes. Using life course theories, this ethnographic study examines how \"historical time and place\" and \"developmental timing\" shape immigrants' choices for bilingual education. Findings demonstrate that the intersections of time and place (the history/structure of organizations, people, policies) and timing (family members' composition and developmental needs) shape parents' interactions with schools, understandings of policies, and children's pathways toward bilingualism. Such findings have implications for theories about the policy process and for districts with growing immigrant student populations. (Contains 1 figure, 2 tables and 4 notes.)",

The cultural construction of smartness has broad consequences related to teacher expectations, student academic identity development, and schooling inequities. This study is based on a 1-year ethnography in a kindergarten classroom, and the author investigates smartness by first historicizing the concept of intelligence and then using the theoretical framework of figured worlds. Through the teachers' disciplinary and pedagogical practices, students were taught and learned not just whether they were smart themselves, but how other student identities were constructed according to smartness as well. Analysis suggests smartness was used as a mechanism of control and social positioning along racial and class lines. Implications are discussed related to schooling practices and policy.",

The author analyzed 194 interviews with students at liberal arts colleges to investigate empirically the ways undergraduates bring knowledge and experiences together so that educators might be able to more intentionally promote the integration of learning. Three distinct types of integration of learning emerged during analysis: (a) connection, the discovery of a similarity between ideas that themselves remain distinctive; (b) application, the use of knowledge from one context in another; and (c) synthesis, the creation of new knowledge by combining insights.

Results indicated significantly more improvement on all measures for children in the affective teaching condition compared to control. Relationships and behavior were significantly associated with children's gains in motivation and content knowledge. The discussion focuses on the importance of SEL for children's development and the potential contribution of affective teaching as a modality of social and emotional learning. (Contains 6 tables.)",

This approach clarifies that effective school resources include compound resources, complex resources, and abstract resources in addition to the simple resources usually included in production functions. The implications of this approach are then explored with the National Educational Longitudinal Survey of the Class of 1988 (NELS88), data rich enough to measure many school resources and many outcomes. The results indicate that simple resources are much less powerful than compound, complex, and abstract resources. Many effective resources are unaffected by spending levels and must be constructed within schools, explaining why money often does not make a difference to outcomes. The results also indicate that, while a few powerful resources affect all outcomes, some affect test scores but not progress through high school, while others affect progress but not learning.

One main finding was that SDP reduced the rate of change and final posttest mean when delinquency was assessed annually between Grades 5 and 8 using a self-report measure of acting out. The present study examined whether these same mean and slope effects would be observed when delinquency was measured from juvenile justice system records instead of self-reports. Hierarchical models of official statistics revealed no evidence favoring SDP between Grades 5 and 8, and the same was basically true during the high school years. So the Chicago variant of SDP did not have a general effect on reducing delinquency. Speculations are offered about why the two delinquency measures produced different results.

        "description":"Understanding the impact of \"instructional regimes\" on student learning is central to advancing educational policy. Research on instructional regimes has parallels with clinical trials in medicine yet poses unique challenges because of the social nature of instruction: A child's potential outcome under a given regime depends on peers and teachers, requiring the need for multilevel methods of causal inference. The author considers studies of the impact of intended versus experienced instructional regimes. Both are important; however, intended regimes are well measured and accessible to randomized trials, whereas experienced instruction is measured with error and not amenable to randomization. Multiyear sequences of experienced instruction are of central interest but pose special methodological challenges. A 2-year study of intensive mathematics instruction illustrates these ideas.

This case study looks at a school once internationally renowned as the exemplar of &quot;free&quot; schooling. The authors consider how the school works as a community, how it impacts on its students, and how it copes with the strictures of the audit culture in relation to &quot;risk&quot; and &quot;safety.&quot; The authors' experiences led them to the realization that physical &quot;touch&quot; was an irrelevant focus in this school, and they developed the notion of &quot;relational touch.&quot; Summerhill works in ways that approximate an inversion of the audit culture. The authors argue that progressive and critical conceptions of education continue to have much to learn from concrete examples like Summerhill and conclude that a revival of such values in education is long overdue.

The domain-general approach seeks a general theory of cognitive and other skills that apply across subject-matter areas. The domain-specific approach seeks to apply specific theories within given domains, such as reading or mathematics. The latter approach is more widely used. But it fails to provide a unified model of learning and instruction. One of the greatest challenges facing modern research in learning and instruction is devising and then empirically testing domain-general theories.

This article examines the enactment of the English National Literacy Strategy (NLS) in a case study of two literacy lessons, which are drawn from a yearlong ethnographic study of the NLS in one school. Although the teacher taught directly from and adhered closely to the prescribed materials, curricular contents were recontextualized into habitual classroom interactional genres, and the open questions that constituted the primary aim of the lesson were suppressed. In explaining these enactment patterns, the author supplements analysis of teacher knowledge and policy support with consideration of conditions of teacher engagement with the policy and the durability of interactional genres, rooted in pupil collusion and &quot;habitus.&quot; (Contains 3 tables, 2 figures, and 20 notes.)",

        "description":"The Parent Education Profile (PEP) is an instrument used by family literacy programs to rate parents' support for children's literacy development. This article uses Critical Discourse Analysis to examine how the PEP constructs the ideal parent, the text's underlying assumptions about parenting and education, and its ideological effects. The analysis shows how many features of the PEP evaluate parents according to a middle-class, predominantly White model of parenting and family-school interaction. Furthermore, the PEP tends to assume a universal, normative model of parental support for literacy, parental (mothers') responsibility for educational outcomes, equal access to resources required to meet the PEP standards, and a limited parental role in assessment. In so doing, the PEP lends support to several dominant discourses regarding poor and minority families, such as the discourse of parent involvement and the \"mothering discourse,\" which encourages mothers' supplementary educational work. Implications for policy, research, and practice are discussed. (Contains 2 tables and 9 notes.)",

Pronounced changes were in the variety of assessments used and the way assessment information was used to support student learning. National Board candidates attributed changes in practice to the National Board standards and assessment tasks.

As educators feel increasingly burdened by competing societal demands, caring for youth sexual health becomes a secondary goal at best. This article argues that the public health costs are only one reason for addressing sexuality in schools and suggests that academic and democratic reasons for addressing sexuality also exist. It illustrates how sexuality can be a potentially powerful resource for increasing the academic achievement and civic engagement of a diverse range of youth. As such, addressing sexuality serves not only public health goals but also academic and democratic goals--goals that have long been central for schools. To make this argument, the author draws from her ethnography of ESPERANZA, a community-based sex education program, illustrating how ESPERANZA used teen interest in sexuality to help youth become leaders, increase academic skills, expand career aspirations, and engage in democratic civic action.

This study tests a model for enhancing mathematics instruction in five high school CTE programs (agriculture, auto technology, business and marketing, health, and information technology). The model includes a pedagogy and intense teacher professional development. Volunteer CTE teachers were randomly assigned to an experimental (n = 59) or control (n = 78) group. The experimental teachers worked with math teachers to develop CTE instructional activities that integrated more mathematics into the occupational curriculum. After 1 year of the math-enhanced CTE lessons, students in the experimental classrooms performed equally on technical skills and significantly better than control students on two standardized tests of math ability (TerraNova and ACCUPLACER[R]).

        "description":"Emergent ethnographic research disentangles \"social capital\" from other components of social class (e.g., material and human capital) to show how class-stratified parental social networks exacerbate educational inequality among schoolchildren. The authors build upon this research by using survey data to reexamine whether certain forms of parental social capital create educational advantages for socioeconomically privileged students vis-a-vis their less economically fortunate peers. By drawing a distinction between the availability of social capital and its convertibility, the authors find that whereas larger stocks of parental social capital accompany higher rungs on the social class ladder, its educational utility is less clearly associated with class status. A possible exception to this pattern pertains to the educational utility of middle-class parents' ideas about the collective efficacy of influencing school policies and practices. At issue is whether a more inclusive understanding of the material and \"sociological\" reasons for educational inequality can spur educationally useful social exchange among parents across social class boundaries.

Growth mixture modeling detected two latent classes of readers: fast readers whose skills developed rapidly and leveled off, and a typical group for which reading growth was somewhat less rapid. Only one latent class was identified for math achievement. For reading, there were small positive associations between observed emotional quality of teacher-child interactions and growth. Growth in math achievement showed small positive relations with observed emotional interactions and exposure to math activities. There was a significant interaction between quality and quantity of instruction for reading such that at higher levels of emotional quality there was less of a negative association between amount of literacy exposure and reading growth.

        "description":"If the notion of public and private spheres seems somehow quaint or old-fashioned, the distinction between public and private corporations will be that much more obscure. Yet Channel One broadcasts in a public school classroom are indisputably the result of a contract between a private corporation (Alloy Media + Marketing) and a public corporation (a local school board). Public school administrators operate within a social and institutional context in which there often appears to be no line between private interests and public interests. The author argues that there is such a line and that public school administrators unwittingly cross it when they make Channel One-type deals. This article examines how the regulatory history of private corporations has shaped the social and institutional context in which public school administrators operate. (Contains 18 notes.)",

The effect of schooling is estimated as the difference between students from two consecutive grades minus the effect of age. A remarkably modest effect on reading performance was found, and no significant effects were found for the other two measures. The effect on reading performance was found to be somewhat stronger in schools with disadvantaged student populations. (Contains 5 tables, 2 figures, and 3 notes.)",

Observational measures indicated that the curricula were implemented with fidelity, and the experimental condition had significant positive effects on classrooms' mathematics environment and teaching. The experimental group score increased significantly more than the comparison group score (effect size = 0.47) and the control group score (effect size = 1.07).

They also examined what approaches to multicultural education the peer-led dialogues suggested. Using the tools of discourse analysis to analyze the dialogue, they found some evidence of reflective problem solving. However, few students engaged in \"critical\" reflection, which entails examining the sociopolitical consequences of solutions and promoting social change through community action projects. Furthermore, many responses reflected deficit theories, stereotypical thinking, and technical-rational problem solving. Interwoven with the analysis of the students' discussion is a self-study dialogue reflecting on the instructor's curriculum and pedagogy. The self-study addresses what the authors have learned about how teacher educators foster critically reflective problem solving regarding issues of language, culture, and race.",

The authors' analysis may assist in the development of socially just teachers: First, emotions and their expression play an important, ongoing role in socially just teaching, and second, emotional negotiation related to socially just teaching can provide deeper understanding of possible change, perhaps even in counterresponse to wider social, political contexts of schools.",

Findings suggest that the teachers' views of their roles varied based on their positioning of themselves as teachers for all students, as teachers for regular education students, or as teachers for a single subject. The teachers' different approaches were related to the ELLs' different levels of participation and their positioning of themselves as powerful or powerless students.

One aspect of this turn has been the resurrection of interest in single-sex classes in coeducational public state schools. This article reviews these developments from an international perspective, particularly focusing on the experiences of a number of United Kingdom secondary schools involved in the 4-year Raising Boys' Achievement Project. The article suggests that, while single-sex classes have the potential to raise the achievement levels of both boys and girls and to have a positive impact on the atmosphere and ethos for learning, these gains will be achieved only if the initiative is developed within gender-relational contexts rather than situated within recuperative masculinity policies.

Drawing on archival and published materials by educators who described school conditions, identified problems, suggested reforms, and evaluated remedies, the author argues that separating boys from girls exacerbated the problems of coeducational schools while generating additional difficulties and dilemmas specific to sex-segregated schools. With the restoration of coeducation in 1954, single-sex schooling, and boys' schools in particular, had been decisively repudiated. For educators, policymakers, and parents engaged in the current debate on sex-separated schooling, this case study involving more than a million male pupils can serve as a cautionary tale about the possible difficulties and potential consequences of a large-scale gender segregation policy.

        "description":"Using data from the 2003 National Assessment of Educational Progress, this analysis compared mathematics achievement in public, charter, and major types of private schools to examine whether disparities in achievement are due to differences in school performance or student demographics in various sectors. Hierarchical linear models were used to control for student- and school-level demographic characteristics. The analysis indicated that the relatively high raw scores of private schools were more than accounted for by student demographics. In fact, after demographic differences had been controlled, the private school advantage disappeared and even reversed in most cases. These findings raise questions about the basis of reform models that seek remedies in parental choice, autonomy, competition, and other attributes associated with the private school sector.

This article reports on the predominant themes of the narratives shared by these faculty of color: teaching, mentoring, collegiality, identity, service, and racism. These themes, consonant with findings from the research literature, can be used to offer suggestions and recommendations for the recruitment and retention of faculty of color in higher education.",

Participants had been randomly assigned to either direct instruction or mediated learning preschool classrooms. At age 19, their achievement was approximately one standard deviation below average. Consistent with results at earlier follow-up points, program main effects were not significant; however, the Aptitude x Treatment interactions (ATIs) documented at earlier ages were absent. Sample differences among follow-up groups may account for the changed ATI findings. A combination of preschool child characteristics and early achievement accounted for 78% of final achievement variance. Male participants had higher achievement than female participants but were disproportionately placed in special education. Special education placement and disability classifications fluctuated over the course of schooling. (Contains 11 tables.)",

        "description":"This study examined 21 preservice secondary teachers as they engaged in activities aimed at fostering an understanding of the epistemic roles that models, theory, and argument play in scientific inquiry. Findings indicate that instruction can help preservice teachers develop more sophisticated understandings of scientific models and promote incorporation of model-based lessons in their classrooms. However, even with scaffolding, the majority of these preservice teachers were unable to use theoretical models to ground their own empirical investigations. Two factors shaped participants' thinking about these inquiries. One was previous school-related research experience, which influenced not only what they recognized as models but also the way they believed models could be incorporated into inquiry. The other was a widely held simplistic view of \"the scientific method\" that constrained the procedures and epistemic frameworks they used for investigations. On the basis of these findings, the authors offer a more focused, evidence-based design for instruction around model-based inquiry. (Contains 3 tables, 2 figures and 3 notes.)",

Both studies showed that the BFLPE was substantial at the end of high school and was still substantial 2 years (Study 1) or 4 years (Study 2) later. In addition, because of the highly salient system of school tracks within the German education system, the authors are able to show that negative effects associated with school type (highly academically selective schools, the Gymnasium) were similar--but smaller--than the BFLPE based on school-average achievement.

        "description":"No Child Left Behind and other education reforms promoting high-stakes testing, accountability, and competitive markets continue to receive wide support from politicians and public figures. This support, the author suggests, has been achieved by situating education within neoliberal policies that argue that such reforms are necessary within an increasingly globalized economy, will increase academic achievement, and will close the achievement gap. However, the author offers preliminary data suggesting that the reforms are not achieving their stated goals. Consequently, educators need to question whether neoliberal approaches to education should replace the previously dominant social democratic approaches.",

        "description":"This study examines accommodationism, a tactic of racial uplift used by black school founders and teachers in the Jim Crow South. For founders, accommodationism was a dangerous process of collaboration, resistance, and compromise. The subject under study is Joseph Winthrop Holley. Born in South Carolina, Holley studied in the North at Phillips Academy and Lincoln University. Despite a liberal education, Holley returned to the South and founded a Bible and industrial school. Holley was the most conservative founder of his day. His life and work take us beyond the Washington-Du Bois paradigm and help to clarify the work and meaning of accommodationism. The study also evaluates the degree to which conservative forms of schooling became a means for social control. (Contains 3 figures and 180 notes.)",

Through qualitative methods, they examined how schools used class-size reduction to change staffing patterns and instructional programs. Requiring changes in space allocation, class-size reduction was accomplished through attention to pupil:teacher ratio, with classes ranging from 15:1 to 30:2 team taught. Most partner classes used tag-team teaching, with one teacher leading and the other doing clerical work. Working without specific professional development to enhance teaching in smaller classes, it made sense that teachers continued to solo practice. Class-size reduction is both a programmatic and instructional reform, and as such, it requires specific professional development to promote change. (Contains 3 tables and 3 notes.)",

These changes had unanticipated, and often negative, consequences for teachers' relationships with students, pedagogy, and sense of professional well-being. The authors use one policy directive, differentiated instruction, to illustrate the complexity of role demands currently made of teachers, and they draw implications for policy and research.

Although there are some differences in the backgrounds of alternatively and traditionally certified teachers, the findings suggest that AC programs have not substantially changed the pool from which new teachers are drawn.

In contrast, no differences in literacy teaching practices were found between teachers in Accelerated Schools Project schools and comparison schools. On the basis of these findings and our knowledge of the implementation support strategies pursued by the CSR programs under study, we conclude that well-defined and well-specified instructional improvement programs that are strongly supported by on-site facilitators and local leaders who demand fidelity to program designs can produce large changes in teachers' instructional practices.

Supporters speak of a new teacher professionalism focused on the &quot;core task&quot; of teaching. Critics fear deprofessionalization through a process of deskilling, work intensification, and labor substitution. This article uses labor process theory and empirical data to analyze recent developments in teachers' work and links these to the different ways in which teacher trade unions have bargained over reform. The article argues that workforce reform cannot be analyzed separately from the trade union strategies that seek to influence policy and that the emergence of a type of &quot;reform unionism&quot; in England represents the integration of product and process in policy.

There are three main findings. First, positive associations were found between quality of teacher-child relationships and achievement. Second, high quality teacher-child relationships buffered children from the negative effects of insecure or other maternal attachment on achievement. Third, the effect of quality of teacher-child relationships on achievement was mediated through child and teacher behaviors in the classroom. In sum, high quality teacher-child relationships fostered children's achievement. Implications for educational practice are discussed. (Contains 5 tables and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"This article develops a conceptual framework for studying how three comprehensive school reform (CSR) programs organized schools for instructional change and how the distinctive strategies they pursued affected implementation outcomes. The conceptual model views the Accelerated Schools Project as using a system of cultural control to produce instructional change, the America's Choice program as using a model of professional control, and the Success for All program as using a model of procedural control. Predictable differences in patterns of organizing for instructional improvement emerged across schools working with these three programs, and these patterns were found to be systematically related to patterns of program implementation. In particular, the two CSR programs that were organized to produce instructional standardization produced higher levels of instructional change in the schools where they worked. The results of the study suggest organizational strategies program developers can use to obtain implementation fidelity in instructional change initiatives.

Consistent with the findings of Hsieh et al., intervention research articles declined from 45% in 1994 to 33% in 2004. For nonintervention articles, the authors recorded the incidence of \"causal\" statements (e.g., if teachers/schools/parents did X, then student/child outcome Y would likely result). Nonintervention research articles containing causal statements increased from 34% in 1994 to 43% in 2004. It appears that at the same time intervention studies are becoming less prevalent in the teaching-and-learning research literature, researchers are more inclined to include causal statements in nonintervention studies.

School staff provided tutoring in phonological awareness, systematic phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and reading comprehension. Tutored students made significantly greater gains reading words and comprehending text than controls, who received a small-group intervention (d = 0.70) or neither intervention (d = 0.74). The majority of tutored students reached average reading levels whereas the majority of controls did not. Paraprofessionals tutored students as effectively as reading specialists except in skills benefiting nonword decoding. Paraprofessionals required more sessions to achieve equivalent gains. Contrary to conventional wisdom, results suggest that students make greater gains when they read text at an independent level than at an instructional level. (Contains 6 tables.)",

The authors address these questions by reporting on a thirty-month longitudinal study into how home, school, and larger society served as contexts for the development of historical consciousness among adolescents. Fifteen families drawn from three different school communities participated. By adopting an intergenerational approach, the authors sought to understand how the defining moments of one generation--its \"lived history\"--becomes the \"available history\" to the next. In this article, the authors focus on what parents and children shared about one of the most formative historical events in parents' lives: the Vietnam War. Drawing on notions of collective memory, as articulated by the French sociologist Maurice Halbwachs, the authors sought to understand which stories, archived in historical memory and available to the disciplinary community, are remembered and used by those beyond its borders. In contrast, which stories are no longer widely shared, eclipsed by time's passage and unable to cross the bridge separating generation from generation? The authors conclude by discussing the forces that act to historicize today's youth and suggest how educators might marshal these forces--rather than spurning or simply ignoring them--to advance young people's historical understanding.

Students (n = 1,651) from four high schools in three states were assessed on their science knowledge, reading skill, and reading strategy knowledge. The dependent variable, content-based science achievement, was measured in terms of students' comprehension of a science passage, science course grade, and state science test scores. The cognitive variables reliably predicted all three measures of science achievement, and there were also significant gender differences. Reading skill helped the learner compensate for deficits in science knowledge for most measures of achievement and had a larger effect on achievement scores for higher knowledge than lower knowledge students. Implications for pedagogy and science assessment are discussed. (Contains 9 tables, 1 figure and 2 notes.)",

The article explores attitudes across age groups, highlighting social reasons for resistance to literacy, and argues that policy makers should consider effects on group membership and ways in which formal literacy can constitute a mechanism for disempowerment.

Opponents make essentially the opposite claim: that expanded state power is intended to disempower local communities and to single them out for blame, in response to larger political and economic imperatives. This article analyzes the enactment of educational accountability policies in four U.S. states, drawing upon legislative documents, hearing and debate transcripts where available, and press coverage. The analysis concludes that policy makers did intend to make the public education system more equitable. However, the results of the policies as implemented show a significant gap between aspirations and results. This gap increases the accountability-policy critics' credibility.

Participants were 912 undergraduate and graduate students (10.7% of student body) from various academic majors enrolled at a public university. A sequential mixed-methods analysis led to the development of the CARE-RESPECTED Model of Teaching Evaluation, which represented characteristics that students considered to reflect effective college teaching--comprising four meta-themes (\"c\"ommunicator, \"a\"dvocate, \"r\"esponsible, \"e\"mpowering) and nine themes (\"r\"esponsive, \"e\"nthusiast, \"s\"tudent centered, \"p\"rofessional, \"e\"xpert, \"c\"onnector, \"t\"ransmitter, \"e\"thical, and \"d\"irector). Three of the most prevalent themes were not represented by any of the TEF items; also, endorsement of most themes varied by student attribute (e.g., gender, age), calling into question the content- and construct-related validity of the TEF scores.

Using the TCSR model, teachers' personal practical theories, and conceptual change as a framework, the authors of this article studied three college science faculty members as they designed and implemented an integrated, inquiry-based science course. The documentation and analysis of context, instructors' knowledge and beliefs, and teaching episodes allowed the authors to identify and study the interaction of factors, including grant support, that shape reform attempts. The results suggest that grant-supported mitigation of structural barriers is a necessary but insufficient precursor to change and that personal practical theories are the most powerful influence on instructional practice. The findings highlight the critical role of pedagogical and contextual dissatisfaction in creating a context for fundamental change. (Contains 2 figures, 2 tables and 3 notes.)",

The authors applied multilevel growth curve modeling techniques to estimate overall DAP effects and to examine possible interactions with sex, ethnicity, grade, and poverty. The results were consistent across years, with only a few significant effects of DAP, some positive and others negative. Collectively, the results indicate that DAP as observed in classrooms accounts for little or no variation in children's academic performance. The article details the methodological and theoretical implications for future inquiry. (Contains 9 tables, 2 figures and 3 notes.)",

This article, based on a year-long interpretive study of a detracked ninth-grade program at a diverse urban high school, focuses on the encounter between the &quot;official&quot; practices of the detracked classrooms under study and the &quot;unofficial&quot; social worlds of the students taking part in those practices. The author describes how aspects of the overall school context framed and permeated students' interactions in their detracked classes, at times leading to a reiteration of the very inequalities that detracking was designed to address.

        "description":"Educators often ignore the political requirements of urban reform in their focus on the research and models that guide it. Conversely, political scientists frequently miss the differences among reforms in their focus on coalitions and resources. Integrating Clarence N. Stone's concept of &quot;civic capacity&quot; with an educator's view of reform types creates a typology of urban school regimes that helps to explain which local political arrangements and coalitions are compatible with various versions of reform. This article applies the typology to Chicago schools, revealing that the civic capacity associated with some reform agendas involves narrow, rather than broad, coalitions; that multiple coalitions compete for the same civic resources; that subtle coalition changes can alter a reform agenda; and that reform itself produces unpredictable political consequences.

The results confirmed that practicing until mastery improved individual exam scores, group success rates, and long-term retention. Moreover, overlearning provided additional benefits, especially in long-term retention. However, fluency-building instructions did not further increase academic achievement or long-term retention.

Traditional explanations for dropout behavior have focused on students' social background and academic behaviors. What high schools might do to push out or hold students has received less empirical scrutiny. Using a sample of 3,840 students in 190 urban and suburban high schools from the High School Effectiveness Supplement of the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988, we apply multilevel methods to explore schools' influence on dropping out, taking into account students' academic and social background. Our findings center on schools' curriculum, size, and social relations. In schools that offer mainly academic courses and few nonacademic courses, students are less likely to drop out. Similarly, students in schools enrolling fewer than 1,500 students more often stay in school. Most important, students are less likely to drop out of high schools where relationships between teachers and students are positive. The impact of positive relations, however, is contingent on the organizational and structural characteristics of high schools. (Contains 2 figures, 4 tables and 9 notes.)",

Drawing on insights from phenomenology, critical geography, bioregionalism, ecofeminism, and other place-conscious traditions, the author gathers diverse perspectives on \"place\" to demonstrate the profoundly pedagogical nature of human experience with places. Five \"dimensions of place\" are described that can shape the development of a socio-ecological, place-conscious education: (a) the perceptual, (b) the sociological, (c) the ideological, (d) the political, and (e) the ecological. After discussing these, the author reframes several place-conscious educational traditions.

This view is in contrast with students' actual performance patterns. An examination across several subject areas, including mathematics, science, and language arts, suggests a common pattern.

On the basis of a case study of the controversy surrounding the building of a charter school at the University of California, San Diego, in response to the elimination of affirmative action in University of California admissions, the authors describe the meaning-making process by which that campus established new procedures for promoting educational equality and constructed new meanings to justify those policies and to resolve conflicts about their legitimacy. The charter school was created after a contentious public debate, in which the concept for the school and tacit definitions of equality, of social responsibility, and of the university itself became objects of contestation. The analysis reveals (a) the constitutive social processes by which particular meanings of equality and social responsibility are constructed and institutionalized, and (b) the role of higher education policy in reconstituting meanings of equality in the wake of affirmative action's political retreat.

        "description":"Charter schools elevate choice and competition to foster educational innovations. Indeed, these market-style mechanisms are intended to challenge standardized practices associated with district administration of schools. However, a comprehensive review of practices in charter schools indicates that, although some organizational innovations are evident, classroom strategies tend toward the familiar. Drawing on organizational and economic theory, this article considers the forces shaping educational innovation in market-oriented reforms. Although reformers assume that competition and choice necessarily lead to innovations within schools, a more complex examination of competitive institutional environments suggests that mechanisms employed by reformers may actually undercut their intended purposes. The discussion highlights the potential for choice and competition to constrain opportunities for educational innovation and to impose pedagogical and curricular conformity.

Preexisting achievement, background, and psychological characteristics were included as covariates to ensure comparability of the groups. Significant post-intervention program effects were found for math and science achievement and course enrollment. In contrast, there were no significant program effects for perceived math competence or math anxiety.

In some respects, this was a routine evaluation, documenting substantial gains (of roughly 1 SD) in genetics reasoning ability in all but 1 of 17 classes, despite challenges presented by school computer-lab settings. Relative to matched comparison classes, larger gains were found in technical biology and general science courses but not in college prep or honors biology courses. In other respects, our effort illustrates the value of new views of assessment, technology, and research. The alignment of a sophisticated research assessment and simple classroom assessments shed light on initial failures, spurring revision. By refining the GenScope activities and extending the classroom assessments, we supported worthwhile whole-class discourse around the shared understanding of the software. A follow-up study in a laptop-equipped classroom yielded the absolute and relative gains (3.1 SD and 1.6 SD) that proponents of such innovations have long promised. In retrospect, the strengths and weakness of the study illustrate the value of newer \"design-based\" approaches to educational research. (Contains 11 figures, 2 tables and 14 notes.)",

Two composite measures of phonics and integrated language arts are constructed from teachers' reports of their instructional practices. Findings show that classroom mean outcomes were significantly higher when classroom teachers reported using both integrated language arts and phonics more often. However, children with low initial performance benefited less from integrated language arts instruction, as measured by direct measures of achievement; such differential effects of instruction were not observed for teacher ratings of children's achievement and learning style. Policy implications of the findings are discussed. (Contains 9 tables, 2 figures, and 3 footnotes.)",

Researchers typically rely on a number of methodologies to control for that factor in learning research, including the use of fictional stimuli and domain-novice subjects. The experiments reported here demonstrate that such methodological controls may be insufficient. In Experiment 1, students read texts about fictional places and events. In Experiment 2, novice students in a cognition course were asked to read several advanced texts. In both experiments, prior knowledge accounted for a large portion of the subjects' posttest performance. The data demonstrate that methodological approaches intended to control for prior knowledge may be insufficient to prevent that variable from influencing learning outcomes. Thus researchers are urged to include measures of prior knowledge in their analyses. (Contains 4 tables and 1 footnote.)",

Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999, we analyze the effect of participation in child care and early education on children's school readiness as measured by early reading and math skills in kindergarten and first grade. We find that children who attended a center or school-based preschool program in the year before school entry perform better on assessments of reading and math skills upon beginning kindergarten, after controlling for a host of family background and other factors that might be associated with selection into early education programs and relatively high academic skills. This advantage persists when children's skills are measured in the spring of kindergarten and first grade, and children who attended early education programs are also less likely to be retained in kindergarten. In most instances, the effects are largest for disadvantaged groups, raising the possibility that policies promoting preschool enrollment of children from disadvantaged families might help to narrow the school readiness gap.

There is a magical change as mathematics, science, and social sciences move from their disciplinary spaces into the classroom. The educational and social psychologies have little or nothing to do with understanding disciplinary practices. They are  intellectual inventions for normalizing and governing the child's conduct, relationships, and communications. The author examines this alchemy in standards-based mathematics educational policy and research for K-12 schools. He argues that (a) the emphasis on &quot;problem solving,&quot; collaboration, and &quot;communities of  learning&quot; sanctify science and scientists as possessing authoritative knowledge over increasing realms of human phenomena, thus narrowing the boundaries of possible action and critical thought; and (b) while reforms stress the need for educational equity for &quot;all children,&quot; with &quot;no child left behind,&quot; the pedagogical models divide, demarcate, and exclude particular children from participation.

This transition occurred within a complex historical, sociological, and economic milieu of three national forces: universities' quest for prestige; the relationship of expertise and professionalism to the middle-class ethos of universities; and Liberal Protestantism. Earlier than previously imagined, &quot;class&quot; became a determinant of access. The University of Michigan is a poignant illustration because of its long tradition of inclusion, from the early admission of women and African American students through its recent defense of affirmative action. Yet, while some doors creaked open for new groups of students, the number of poor undergraduates on campus waned--and remains woefully low. (Contains 2 tables and 39 notes.)",

This article uses case studies of three high school science teachers to develop a framework for teaching with the Internet, exploring how the Internet shapes and is shaped by classroom practices. The framework includes five affordances of resources: (a) boundaries, (b) authority, (c) stability, (d) pedagogical context, and (e) disciplinary context. These interact with fundamental challenges of teaching to produce wide variation in Internet use. The case studies suggest that affordances vary because of activity design and characteristics of the resource. Challenges to teachers depend on how they position themselves with respect to the affordances. (Contains 4 tables and 4 footnotes.)",

TIs involved groups of ninth-grade students working on an algebra problem; videotaped lessons were transcribed and analyzed. Results showed that teachers initiated most TIs and typically did so when students were off-task or showed little progress. After TIs, students' TOT and problem solving often improved. Teacher evaluations of student actions had the largest positive effects, sewing as gatekeepers for other teacher actions. Higher levels of teacher help content tended to reduce post-TI TOT, while teacher commands reduced post-TI TOT only when a group grasped the problem situation. In summary, TIs can increase TOT and problem solving, especially if teachers evaluate students' work. (Contains 2 footnotes, 9 tables, and 1 figure.)",

Using Hung's theory of epistemological appropriation in an analysis of the co-op supervisor's regulatory behaviors (scaffolding, modeling, and coaching) and of the novice's corresponding regulatory behaviors (submitting, mirroring, and constructing) helped to explain the developments in this student's learning, actions, and beliefs. In contrast to the progression suggested by Hung's theory, this study reports daily examples of all types of regulatory behaviors, with scaffolding/submitting being most prominent. The discussion focuses on how Hung's theory of regulatory behaviors informs supervisors' improving opportunities for novices' learning and informs novices' engagement in epistemological appropriation in work-based learning.

Schema-based transfer instruction (SBTI) explicitly teaches transfer features that change problems in superficial ways to make them appear novel even though they still require known solution strategies. This study assessed the effects of an expanded version of SBTI incorporating more challenging transfer features for broadening schemas and helping children recognize real-life math problems as solvable. Teachers were assigned randomly to 16-week control, SBTI, or expanded SBTI conditions. Students completed pretests and posttests focusing on increasing transfer distances. On a measure approximating real-life problem solving, the expanded SBTI group outperformed the SBTI group, which in turn  outperformed the control group.

        "description":"Persuasion is an interactive process through which a given message alters individuals' perspectives by changing the knowledge, beliefs, or interests that underlie those perspectives. Although persuasion is seen as central to effective teaching and learning, there is still much to understand about the characteristics of learners, texts, and tasks that result in such changes. In this study, persuasion was tested as undergraduates read three compelling, popular-press texts on varied topics. Differences across and within readers were examined by means of multivariate and path analytic techniques. Texts written to persuade did, in fact, change readers' knowledge, beliefs, and interest, and preexisting differences in knowledge, beliefs, and interest directly and indirectly influenced the degree of change. Furthermore, different texts elicited varied levels of knowledge, beliefs, and interest in individual readers. (Contains 2 figures, 4 tables, and 3 footnotes.)",

The authors of this article argue that school violence is the result of the structural violence of oppressive social conditions that force students (especially low-income, male African American and Latino students) to feel vulnerable, angry, and resistant to the normative expectations of prison-like school environments. From the vantage point of the intersection of critical race theory and materialist disability studies, the authors examine the impact of social, political, economic, and institutional structures on the social construction of the \"deviant\" student. They raise questions regarding violent \"normalizing\" structures and argue for more empowering alternatives. (Contains 1 note.)",

Their underlying beliefs, however, differ. This article calls attention to the spectrum of ideas about what good citizenship is and what good citizens do that are embodied in democratic education programs. It offers analyses of a 2-year study of educational programs in the United States that aimed to promote democracy. Drawing on democratic theory and on findings from their study, the authors detail three conceptions of the &quot;good&quot; citizen--personally responsible, participatory, and justice oriented--that underscore political implications of education for democracy. The article demonstrates that the narrow and often ideologically conservative conception of citizenship embedded in many current efforts at teaching for democracy reflects not arbitrary choices but, rather, political choices with political consequences.

The author analyzes the relationship between school and district characteristics and the base year of the Academic Performance Index (API), the state's main measure of school performance, focusing on variables related to the main issues in the Williams case.

Combining data from state policy surveys, F-33, SASS, and NAEP, the article shows that during the 1990s, the states did not address racial and socioeconomic disparities in school resources and failed to narrow the achievement gaps among racial and socioeconomic groups. The distributions of school expenditures, class size, qualified teachers, and mathematics achievement remained largely unchanged in strong accountability states. Although the accountability policy of the 1990s neither produced adverse effects nor brought about significant setbacks in equity, this article suggests that racial and socioeconomic equity were not at the center of accountability reforms and that performance-driven accountability policies alone cannot move us forward toward equity.

        "description":"A group of Israeli high school students (h = 11) from two socially distinct schools read aloud a textbook account of a 1920 bloody encounter between Jews and Arabs. The study aimed at examining the relation between the textbook account and the students' formation of historical perceptions. Prior to reading the textbook excerpts, students wrote accounts of the event from their memory (the prenarrative). After being questioned about the prenarratives, the students read the textbook excerpts aloud and explained their understanding of the event. Twelve months later, they wrote another account of the event (the postnarrative). The study found that students &quot;culturally comprehended&quot; the textbook, or, in other words, that the nature of the students' recollection was strongly affected by the social memory of the group within which they lived.

        "description":"This study investigated the relationships among several different indicators of high school performance: test scores, dropout rates, transfer rates, and attrition rates. Hierarchical linear models were used to analyze panel data from a sample of 14,199 students who took part in the National Education Longitudinal Survey of 1988. The results generally support the notion of an alternative as opposed to a common view of school effectiveness: Schools that are effective in promoting student learning (growth in achievement) are not necessarily effective in reducing dropout or transfer rates. In fact, after control for student inputs, high schools exhibit relatively little variability in dropout rates but considerable variation in transfer rates. In addition, characteristics of schools that contributed to performance in one area often did not contribute to performance in another. Given these findings, the authors suggest that, along with test scores, dropout and transfer rates should be used to judge school performance. (Contains 33 footnotes, 5 tables and 2 figures.)",

Analyses conducted from 1992 through the spring of 2003 are presented in light of both increasing accountability requirements and national and state calls for urban school reform.

Development of teaching competence was followed from candidates' enrollment until their third year as in-service teachers. Occupational socialization in schools was demonstrated to have a considerable influence on the development of graduates' in-service competence. However, evidence was also produced for an impact of specific characteristics of the teacher education programs studied involving the integration of practical experience and theoretical study.

        "description":"This article uses two dominant traditions in the organizational study of schools--the neoinstitutional and faculty workplace approaches--to explain an urban elementary school's response to the Texas Accountability System. The findings indicate that teachers, guided by an institutional logic, sought to create the appearance of test score improvement by using a constellation of &quot;educational triage&quot; practices. Educational triage was manifest in the diversion of resources to students believed to be on the threshold of passing the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (&quot;bubble kids&quot;) and to &quot;accountable&quot; students (those affecting the school's accountability rating). Teachers also attempted to remove any liabilities to the school's rating by referring these students for special education. To explain why teachers participated in educational triage, the author shows how the equation of good teaching with high test scores by the institutional environment and the district reconstituted both teacher professional identities and teacher-teacher relationships.

First, propensity score matching techniques revealed that children from Mexican immigrant families were overrepresented in schools with a wide variety of problematic characteristics, even when family background differences were taken into account. Second, multilevel models revealed that the mathematics achievement, mental health, and interpersonal functioning of these children were often at lower levels in such schools.

In this article, the authors draw upon ethnographic methodology to report on the stories of three working-class immigrant parents and their efforts to participate in their children's formal education. Their stories are used as exemplars to illuminate the challenges  immigrant parents face as they work to participate in their children's schooling. In contrasting the three stories, the authors argue that parental engagement needs to be understood through parents' presence in schooling, regardless of whether that presence is in a formal school space or in more personal, informal spaces, including those created by parents themselves.

Some of the relations that had been detected before children's school entry were maintained. Higher-quality child care continued to be linked to higher scores in math, reading, and memory. More time spent in center care was associated with better memory but also with more conflictual relationships. Some new associations were detected: More hours of care were linked to poorer work habits and poorer social skills. The relation between amount of care and externalizing behaviors decreased and was not significant in third grade. These findings support the relative independence of quality, quantity, and type of child care in relation to child developmental outcomes. (Contains 1 note, 6 tables and 4 figures.)",

Fifteen-year-olds from 41 countries completed a questionnaire and tests in mathematics, reading, and science. Multilevel regression analyses showed that students scored higher in all subjects when they had more resources in their country, family, or school. Students in countries with higher inequality, clustering of privileged students, or unequal distribution of certified teachers typically had lower scores. Distribution inequality favored privileged students, in that schools with more privileged students typically had more resources. Overall, students scored lower when parent job status had a larger effect on student performance (privileged student bias) in a school or country. These results suggest that equal opportunity is linked to higher overall student achievement. (Contains 1 note, 3 tables and 1 figure.)",

The authors argue that contemporary social integration and multicultural theories of student retention theory do not adequately address the academic needs of  underrepresented students of color. Relying on case studies of student-initiated retention projects (SIRPs) at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Wisconsin, Madison, the authors develop insights into how student retention theory might be reconsidered for students of color. Three key components of SIRPs are discussed: developing knowledge, skills, and social networks; building community ties and commitments; and challenging social and institutional norms. Findings are then synthesized with theoretical constructs largely deriving from the work of Pierre Bourdieu, Frantz Fanon, and Paulo Freire. The result is a theoretical framework grounded in the concepts of cultural and social capital, collectivism, and social praxis. (Contains 2 tables and 6 notes.)",

In contrast to such counterproductive practices, the author offers a comparative analysis of two schools' efforts at student empowerment. He first outlines why schools should help empower students and then proposes a conception of student empowerment founded on three dimensions: the academic, political, and social. To explore the &quot;possibilities and pitfalls&quot; of empowerment in practice, the author presents case studies of two schools' student empowerment efforts. Each examines how the schools sought to help empower students, what power students gained, and how students and faculty responded to these efforts. Drawing on insights derived from these studies, he discusses some practical implications for schools hoping to promote student empowerment. (Contains 13 notes.)",

Through the use of a cluster randomization design, schools were randomly assigned to implement Success for All or control methods. Hierarchical linear model analyses involving the longitudinal sample revealed statistically significant school-level effects of assignment to Success for All on three of the four literacy outcomes measured. Effects were as large as one quarter of a standard deviation--a learning advantage relative to controls exceeding half of a school year. Impacts for the combined longitudinal and in-mover sample were smaller in magnitude and more variable. The results correspond with the Success for All program theory, which targets school-level reform through multiyear sequencing of intensive literacy instruction. (Contains 5 tables and 3 notes.)",

Four hundred eighty-two undergraduates completed measures regarding their beliefs about knowledge, competency beliefs, and achievement values relative to history and mathematics and participated in domain learning tasks. Cluster analysis was used to identify epistemological belief profile groups within the domains of history and mathematics. Students with more sophisticated belief profiles had higher levels of motivation and task performance. Although the configuration of profiles differed across domains, cross-domain analyses suggested a tendency for students to be relatively consistent in the sophistication of their beliefs across domains. These findings provide evidence of the dual nature of epistemological beliefs. (Contains 4 tables and 3 figures.)",

In this study, the author used a cultural sociological perspective to examine how teachers and students at two urban high schools enacted a district-wide merit promotion policy. Findings indicate that rather than compelling teachers and students to remedy school failure academically, the policy facilitated a type of moral boundary work that distinguished \"deserving\" students from those  deemed \"undeserving.\" Moral boundaries were manifest in classroom practices that limited the learning opportunities provided to demoted students. The study extends research on merit promotion by illuminating how such policies operate in urban high schools as both resources for students' identity construction and as mechanisms of social exclusion.

The ability of both White and Chinese American students to weather school transitions and to remain on track for high achievement and attainment can be explained by both social structural and cultural factors.

A quasi-experimental cohort design was used to evaluate subsequent completion of advanced high school math courses as well as academic achievement. Results showed that probability of completion of advanced math courses increased significantly and markedly in all groups, including minority students, students of low socioeconomic status, and students at all initial achievement levels. Also, the performance of initial high achievers did not differ statistically in heterogeneous classes relative to previous homogeneous grouping, and rates of participation in advanced placement calculus and test scores improved.

Hypotheses from Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital were assessed with tests, chi-square statistics, and hierarchical regressions. Consistent with the theory, parents with different demographic characteristics exhibited different types of involvement, and the types of involvement exhibited by parents from dominant groups had the strongest association with achievement. However, contrary to theoretical expectations, members of dominant and nondominant groups benefited similarly from certain types of involvement and differently from others.

SRSD had a positive impact on the writing performance and knowledge of struggling second-grade writers attending urban  schools serving a high percentage of low-income families. In comparison with children in the Writers' Workshop condition, SRSD instructed students were more knowledgeable about writing and evidenced stronger performance in the two instructed genres (story and persuasive writing) as well as two uninstructed genres (personal narrative and informative writing). Moreover, the peer support component augmented SRSD instruction by enhancing specific aspects of students' performance in both the instructed and uninstructed genres. (Contains 7 tables.)",

        "description":"Policy problems do not exist as social fact awaiting discovery. Rather, they are constructed as policymakers and constituents interpret a particular aspect of the social world as problematic. How a policy problem is framed is important because it assigns responsibility and creates rationales that authorize some policy solutions and not others. This article brings together sense-making theory and frame analysis to understand the dynamics of problem framing during policy implementation. Data were derived from a yearlong ethnographic study of one school's response to the California Reading Initiative. Results showed that the school's response depended on how school staff constructed their understanding of the relevant problem to be solved. The problem framing process was iterative and contested, shaped by authority relations and mediated by teachers' social networks. Ultimately, it proved important for motivating and coordinating action, reshaping authority relations, and influencing teachers' beliefs and practices. (Contains 6 notes.)",

Yet, discourse about scholarship's personal and emotional meanings is uncommon, given historic separations (reified in university policy) between emotional and cognitive work and between personal and professional endeavors. This study blurs such distinctions by portraying academic work as anchored in a concept of \"passionate thought\": as discrete and bounded peak experiences and as contextualization of these peak experiences in broader emotional processes, interactions, and remembrance. The study's contributions include its representation of scholarly learning as emotional in content and as emotionally contextualized (and thereby as emotionally complex) and its implications for reform of policy discourses to account for the personal content of scholarly work.

Participants were 44 students selected from a larger sample enrolled in a recruitment and support program aimed at members of underrepresented minority groups. The theoretical framework included ethnic identity development, stereotype threat, cultural continuity/discontinuity, and bias in standardized testing. Findings showed differences between Latino and African American students who took PRAXIS I and gender and socioeconomic differences within each ethnic group. Three &quot;composite portraits&quot; revealed similarities and differences across race, class, and gender and evidence that PRAXIS I is an inequitable admissions tool. (Contains 4 notes.)",

In creating single-sex classes throughout the school, the Single Sex Academy (SSA) became the largest public experiment with single-sex schooling in the country, but pressure to raise its standardized test scores diverted the school away from the exploration and implementation of the gender reform. The chronicle of SSA is particularly relevant in light of (a) a recent call to relax Title standards and increase the numbers of public single-sex classes and schools, and (b) the provision of monies mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 for single-sex classes and schools, along with the act's imposition of accountability standards and testing.",

Results suggest that segregation matters in predicting school-level performance on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test after control for other known and purported predictors of standardized test performance.

The present 2-year study incorporated mixed methods and a multilevel design that included state policy, local conditions, and teachers' beliefs and practices, highlighting two cases from a larger database. The authors report how differences in district capital shape responses to state policy, influence teacher recruitment, interact with teacher characteristics, and create learning opportunities for new teachers that suggest the creation of two classes of teachers for two classes of students. While previous researchers have identified student tracking as reproducing inequities, this article examines the largely unexplored terrain of new teacher tracking: the sorting and socialization of novices.",

The data-modeling approach assisted children in coordinating their understanding of particular cases with an evolving notion of data as an aggregate of cases. Students learned to \"read\" shapes of distributions as signatures of prospective mechanisms of plant growth and conducted sampling investigations to represent repeated growth. These investigations, in turn, supported students' interpretations of the effects of added light and fertilizer. The authors argue for both the feasibility and importance of tools such as distribution and inference for supporting education that builds on children's own investigations of the world.",

Ninety first-graders were required to write two themes in the \"D\" mode and two themes in the \"A\" mode to determine differences in the performance levels of these two common modes of discourse. Three types of short discussion sessions--\"A\" mode, \"D\" mode, and neutral--were combined in various patterns with theme-writing activity to test the effect of this kind of stimulation on the children's performances. Themes were graded by using a theme-rating scale that excluded all grammatical criteria.  Variables such as the child's sex and the order in which he wrote the four themes and participated in the three discussion groups were measured. Results of the testing indicated that (1) the \"D\"-mode discussion raised the descriptive quality of themes in the \"A\" mode and reduced the argumentative quality of both types of themes, and (2) the \"A\"-mode discussion had little effect on the argumentative quality of either of the two types of themes.

But what is known empirically about whether school improvement works, which policies are most effective, which contexts respond best to intervention, and how long it takes? We meta-analyze 141 estimates from 67 studies of post-No Child Left Behind Act turnaround policies. On average, policies had moderate positive effects on math and no effect on English Language Arts achievement on high-stakes exams. We find positive impacts on low-stakes exams and no evidence of harm on non-test outcomes. Extended learning time and teacher replacements predict greater effects. Contexts serving majority-Latina/o populations saw the largest improvements. We cannot rule out publication bias entirely but find no differences between peer-reviewed versus non-peer-reviewed estimates.",

We test these findings using an experimental assignment of teacher candidates to placement sites in two states. Candidates who were randomly assigned to higher quality placement sites experienced larger improvements in performance over the course of the clinical experience, as evaluated by field instructors (a.k.a university instructors).

Using a unique data set from a large school district in the southeastern United States, I apply a series of within-school and within-student comparisons to assess the effectiveness of homegrown teachers who returned to teach in their home district. Discrete time survival analysis is then used to examine differences in when early career teachers exit the district. Study results show that homegrown teachers make small but statistically meaningful improvements in student achievement in English language arts. They are also more likely to identify as Black compared with other beginning teachers and less likely to exit the district.",

Drawing on national data from the School Funding Fairness Data System and the Common Core of Data, this study examines the association between contemporary patterns of segregation between districts within a state and racial disparities in school district revenue over time.

Drawing on Black queer studies and a proposed framework of STEM education as a White, cisheteropatriarchal space, our study addresses this research gap by exploring four Black queer students' experiences of oppression and agency in navigating invisibility as STEM majors. A counter-storytelling analysis reveals how curricular erasure and within-group peer tensions shaped variation in undergraduate Black queer students' STEM experiences of invisibility.

        "description":"Police stops often perpetuate racial disparities in academic outcomes, yet few studies have examined factors that mitigate these negative consequences. Using two longitudinal studies (Study 1: n = 483, M-age = 12.88, 53% males; Study 2: n = 131, M-age = 15.11, 34% males), this article tests whether parental and school cultural socialization reduced the negative associations between police stops and youth's school engagement. Results showed that youth with police encounters reported lower school engagement. Parental cultural socialization conferred protection in one study, while school cultural socialization was a protective factor in both studies. The implications of this work stand to benefit those working to reduce the negative links between policing and African American youth's school engagement.",

        "description":"This article examines the complex process of teachers' care for students in contexts of inclusive refugee education in Jordan, where Syrian refugees and Jordanian students study together. I illustrate that while teachers' caring practices represent efforts to support refugee students, they are limited by teachers' inability to see the social, structural, and systemic power dynamics that restrict Syrian refugees, reifying unequal relations of power between refugees and nationals. National teachers are embedded in the social fabric of the societies in which they live and not impervious to the discriminatory attitudes towards refugees, thereby limiting the extent of their care. This article illuminates the complexity of inclusive refugee education and concludes with implications for teacher education and professional development.",

Examining all graduates from Tennessee TPPs from 2010 to 2018, we find meaningful differences between TPPs in both initial level and early-career growth in teaching effectiveness. We also find that different TPP features explain part of these differences. Yet the features that correlate with initial teaching effectiveness are not the same features that correlate with growth.

Bias was estimated as the difference in causal estimate between each NECGD and a carefully appraised randomized experiment with the same intervention, outcome, and estimand. Results indicated that bias generally declined with the number of design elements in an NECGD, that combining all three sufficed to eliminate bias but was not necessary for it, and that this pattern of results was largely replicated across five different replication factors.",

        "description":"Land acknowledgments are an evolving practice to recognize local Indigenous Peoples as traditional stewards of their homelands. Using a content and discourse analysis, we conduct the first empirical study of U.S. land acknowledgment statements focusing on the 47 land-grab universities created under the 1862 Morrill Act. We find that LGUs tend to adopt statements in urban areas, where federally recognized tribes are present, and at institutions with over 100 enrolled Native American students. Land acknowledgment statements also commonly name local Indigenous Peoples yet often fail to articulate their responsibilities to them, include superficial gestures, and center multicultural language. We offer &quot;rhetorical removal&quot; to describe the tendency of land-grab universities to deploy language that selectively erases Indigenous Peoples and, thus, argue that statements must directly address settler colonial legacies of violence and redistribute material support for Indigenous students and partnerships with Native nations.",

        "description":"This article contributes to our understanding of American education politics by exploring when and why states redistribute K-12 education dollars to poorer schools. It does so by examining three explanations for intrastate changes in progressivity: court-ordered finance reforms, political trends, and demographic changes. Using state-level data from 1995 to 2016, we find mixed evidence that progressivity increased following a court-ordered school-finance overhaul. Rather, we show that changes in progressivity were most consistently tied to changes in student demography: As students became poorer, or more racially diverse, lawmakers created less progressive finance systems. The article concludes by discussing what these findings mean for advocates seeking to protect and advance gains in education-spending progressivity.",

Informed by past conceptualizations of the research-practice gap and sociocultural theory, I look closely at how these practitioners made use of the state's highly elaborated implementation tools for research-based decision-making. I argue that these micro-processes point to possible new dimensions of the research-practice gap--namely, practitioners' understandings of the purposes of evidence, the degree of confidence evidence should provide, and the commensurability of different forms of evidence",

The results confirmed that the more place-based workforce development adolescents reported, the higher their expectancy beliefs, STEM career interest, and rural community aspirations.

        "description":"Half of kindergarten teachers split children into higher and lower ability groups for reading or math. In national data, we predicted kindergarten ability group placement using linear and ordinal logistic regression with classroom fixed effects. In fall, test scores were the best predictors of group placement, but there was bias favoring girls, high-SES (socioeconomic status) children, and Asian Americans, who received higher placements than their scores alone would predict. Net of SES, there was no bias against placing black children in higher groups. By spring, one third of kindergartners moved groups, and high-SES children moved up more than their score gains alone would predict. Teacher-reported behaviors (e.g., attentiveness, approaches to learning) helped explain girls' higher placements, but did little to explain the higher placements of Asian American and high-SES children.",

Drawing from interview data with 32 Black undergraduate students, we explore intraracial academic and social norms at two PWIs, with a particular focus on how students' intersectional identities inform their relationships and experiences with other Black students. We add to the growing literature that actively challenges the homogenization of Black student populations and discuss how intraracial norms contribute to students' campus adjustment and sense of belonging.",

Leveraging an exogenous policy change and rich administrative records, we look at the outcomes of pre- and postprogram cohorts of ELs (N = 15,090) in treated and untreated high schools.

We examine student discipline as RJ programs matured in Meadowview Public Schools from 2008 to 2017. Our difference-in-difference estimates show that students in RJ schools experienced a profound decline in their suspension rates during the first 5 years of implementation. However, the benefits of RJ were not shared by all students, as disciplinary outcomes for Black students were largely unchanged. While the overall effects of RJ in this context are promising, racial disproportionality widened. Our results suggest that the racial equity intentions of RJ may be diluted as schools integrate RJ into their existing practices.",

In this article, I focus on Latinx charter school choosers in Houston, Texas, and ask what motivates Latinx parents to exit district schools. Drawing on interviews with 31 families, I find that perceptions of present and future risk motivate charter school choice. Perceptions of present risk centered on children's negative experiences with safety and academics and parents' negative experiences when they attempted to intervene in district schools. Perceptions of future risk focused on future district schools and relied on information from networks, observations, and the educational experiences of U.S.-born parents. Parents framed charter school choice as a strategy to mitigate risk and protect their children's educational futures.

This study examines the impact of Texas's National Research University Fund (NRUF), which uses financial incentives to support institutions' pursuit of prestige, on the salaries and employment of faculty. For full professors, the NRUF had a positive effect on the salaries of both men and women, but the policy also contributed to widening the gender gap in salary. In regard to employment, the NRUF had a negative impact on the share of women among full professors. The findings suggest that organizational pursuit of prestige may have unintended consequences for faculty gender equity.",

The study finds that several measures of teacher effectiveness consistently predict EL reclassification. Sensitivity and robustness checks substantiate these relationships.

Guided by theory from behavioral economics, social psychology, and decision-making, we examine the inner workings of five faculty search committees to understand how committee members identified and assessed risk with particular attention to assessments of risk that became intermingled with social biases. Committees identified and assessed five risks, including candidate interest, candidate disciplinary expertise, candidate competence, candidate collegiality, and the timing and oversight of the search process itself.

        "description":"Challenges in the measurement of racial disparities in school discipline are a significant barrier to identifying policy and programmatic reforms that are effective at closing gaps. This article reviews key measurement issues and presents a set of empirical analyses as an illustrative case study. Specifically, we reframe the interpretation of discipline data in light of initiatives designed to reduce racial discipline disparities. We also characterize common metrics and recognize several additional ones for use in discipline disproportionality outcome evaluations. Leveraging a statewide policy reform as an example, we report findings from a quasi-experimental evaluation, which demonstrated that the various metrics can point to differing conclusions. We conclude with proposed guiding principles for the selection and use of discipline disproportionality metrics in evaluations.",

In this study, I compare two schools in Ecuador to show how divergent ways of teaching Kichwa promote or reject state policies of language standardization and the kinds of citizens foregrounded by them. By comparing the schools' approaches to teaching Kichwa, I call attention to linguistic registers as they carry out or contest predominant forms of citizenship. These examples provide a pathway to study inclusive language policies and classrooms and to understand the multiplicity of ways that citizenship manifests in communication.",

Findings show that affirmative action bans have led to the greatest reductions in science-related fields of engineering, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. These declines pose serious long-term consequences for the United States since these fields provide specialized training critical to the nation's ability to compete effectively in a global market and for ensuring continued scientific and technological advancement.

        "description":"The spread of examination throughout educational institutions is often viewed as an overly constraining influence, one that distorts pedagogic relationships and prevents more genuine educational activities from taking place. This critique of examination ignores the extent to which the structure of the school and the soul of the child are already constituted by examining techniques. A survey of the 19th-century emergence of mass schooling shows that examining techniques have long been embedded in schools. The early development of mass schooling incorporated two distinct and enduring approaches to the formation of souls: disciplinary and pastoral examination. These examining practices would help construct the kind of self-governing subjectivities required by the nation-state. Those who seek to confront practices of examination today face a task that is far more demanding than it first appears. This confrontation would involve nothing less than a rigorous and wide-ranging critique of how examination and schooling in their various forms continue to assemble us as subjects of power.

Consistent with the BFLPE, when prior achievement was controlled, students in the high-ability stream had lower English and mathematics self-concepts (ESCs and MSCs) and those in the lower-ability stream had higher ESCs and MSCs. Consistent with the local-dominance effect, the effect of stream-average achievement on ESCs and MSCs was more negative than--and completely subsumed--the negative effect of school-average achievement. However, stream-average achievement was stronger than, or as strong as, the more local class-average achievement. Taken together, findings highlight the potential interplay of a local dominance effect with variability and/or salience of target comparisons in academic self-concept formations.

        "description":"American educational policy was rapidly transformed between 1980 and 2001. Accountability was introduced into a sphere that had long been loosely coupled, both major political parties reevaluated longstanding positions, and significant institutional control over the schooling shifted to the federal government for the first time in the nation's history. These changes cannot be explained by conventional theories such as interest groups, rational choice, and historical institutionalism. Drawing on extensive archival research and more than 80 interviews, this article argues that this transformation can be explained by a changed policy paradigm which restructured the political landscape around education reform. More generally, while previous scholars have observed that \"policies create politics\" it should also be recognized that \"paradigms create politics\". (Contains 3 tables, 1 figure, and 28 notes.)",

I also, however, argue for specific changes in the existing framework of racial microaggressions, contending that the term microaggression is at times misused within academia and that this misuse has potentially negative consequences.

The design allowed for the estimation of the counterfactual growth trajectory based on those students randomly assigned either to a tutoring cohort with a delayed start or to a wait list. Results demonstrate strong end of first grade effects on a diagnostic measure developed by MR and weak to moderate effects (effect size, 0.15-0.30) on measures administered by external evaluators. By the end of second grade, no significant effects were found on any measures. Practical and research implications are discussed. (Contains 7 tables, 3 figures, and 5 notes.)",

No research to date, however, has examined change in school segregation since 2000. Using the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core of Data (CCD), we examine longitudinal trends in racial/ethnic segregation in 350 U.S. metropolitan areas from 1993 to 2009. We find that worsening segregation over the 1990s has given way to a period of modest integration among all racial/ethnic groups since 1998. However, decreases in segregation were smaller in the formerly de jure segregated South and in metropolitan areas with large increases in racial/ethnic diversity. In addition, since 1998, the relative importance of segregation among non-Whites has increased, while the proportion of segregation that lies across district boundaries has stabilized.

        "description":"This article considers whether the socioeconomic diversity of the undergraduate student body and experiences with cross-class interaction (CCI) are significantly related to cross-racial interaction (CRI) and engagement with curricular/co-curricular diversity (CCD) activities. Individual students who reported higher levels of CCI had significantly higher levels of CRI and CCD. While the socioeconomic diversity of the student body had no direct effect on student involvement in CCD activities or CRI, it had an indirect effect on these activities via CCI. In other words, a socioeconomically diverse institution is associated with more frequent interactions across class lines, which is associated both with more frequent interactions across race and greater involvement in CCD activities. Findings indicate that both socioeconomic and racial diversity are essential to promoting a positive campus racial climate and that racial and socioeconomic diversity, while interrelated, are not interchangeable. Implications for the campus climate for diversity are discussed. (Contains 2 tables, 1 figure, and 2 notes.)",

We examined how 26 beginning secondary science teachers developed instructional repertoires as they participated in two types of communities, one infused with discourses and tools supportive of ambitious teaching and another that reinforced traditional practices. We found three trajectories of practice--each with distinctive signatures for how novices engaged students intellectually. Differences were explained by: the communities with which teachers most closely identified, the degree to which teachers' discourses about student thinking were developed within these communities, and how teachers used tools from the communities to shape their practice.

Planned contrasts revealed that the add-1 conditions were more effective than regular instruction/practice in promoting the learning of the add-1 rule. Contrary to the conclusions of Alfieri, Brooks, Aldrich, and Tenenbaum (2011) and Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006), participants in the structured add-1 condition did not outperform those in the unstructured add-1 group on practiced and unpracticed n + 1 and 1 + n items at the posttests. The control participants did not exhibit evidence of learning a general near-doubles reasoning strategy (if 4 + 4 is 8 and 4 + 5 = 4 + 4 + 1, then the sum of 4 + 5 must be 9). The add-1, but not the active-control, participants achieved success, including transfer, because the former had mastered the developmental prerequisites for add-1 rule and the latter had not mastered the prerequisites for the near-doubles strategy.

Growth curve models show that Turkish-origin children start with lower test scores at the age of 3 regarding German language skills and cultural knowledge but not with respect to cognitive skills. The difference in the language domain decreases until the age of 6 while it increases regarding children's cultural knowledge. Immigrant parents' acculturation to the receiving country is positively related with all three academic skill domains. The results point to the importance of early intervention strategies.

Seventy Head Start classrooms (N = 1,415 children) were randomly assigned to one of two curriculum programs: EPIC or the Developmental Learning Materials Early Childhood Express, with curricula implemented as stand-alone programs. EPIC included instruction in mathematics, language, literacy, and approaches to learning skills; formative assessment; and a learning community for teachers. Multilevel growth modeling through four direct assessments revealed significant main effects and growth rates in mathematics and listening comprehension favoring EPIC, controlling for demographics and special needs and language status. Both programs produced significant growth rates in literacy. (Contains 2 figures, 2 tables, and 2 notes.)",

But the mechanistic pathways by which skills develop have remained untested: Does receiving and providing feedback lead to learning because it produces more extensive revision behavior or is such immediate implementation of feedback unnecessary? These pathways were tested through analyses of the relationships between feedback provided and received, feedback implemented and overall revisions, and improved writing quality in a new article. Overall, the number of revisions predicted growth in writing ability, and both amount of received and provided feedback were associated with being more likely to make revisions. However, providing feedback was also directly related to growth in writing ability.",

We show that the vast majority of districts have racial enrollment gaps in both programs, with wider gaps in AP than DE. Results from fractional regression models indicate that geographic variations in these gaps can be explained by both local and state factors. We also find that district-level resources and state policies that provide greater access to AP and DE are also associated with wider racial enrollment gaps, implying that greater resources may engender racial disparity without adequate efforts to provide equitable access and support for minority students.",

Although on average school districts' test scores improved very modestly (by about 0.001 standard deviations per year), there is significant variation among districts. Moreover, we find that average test score disparities between nonpoor and poor students and between White and Black students are growing; those between White and Hispanic students are shrinking. We find no evidence of achievement-equity synergies or trade-offs: Improvements in overall achievement are uncorrelated with trends in achievement disparities. Finally, we find that the strongest predictors of achievement disparity trends are the levels and trends in within-district racial and socioeconomic segregation and changes in differential access to certified teachers.",

Districts more likely to report SEB problems were identified and supported internally when they had elementary SEB programs, were located in urban areas, and had higher socioeconomic status levels. District administrators who reported that SEB problems were identified and addressed internally, including use of universal screening procedures, reported the highest levels of knowledge about their SEB approach as well as willingness to change their practices.

Across two independent double-blind randomized field trials involving over 2,000 seventh graders in 11 middle schools, we tested the efficacy of a brief intervention to buffer students from stereotypes and mitigate the racial suspension gap. The self-affirmation intervention helps students access positive aspects of their identities less associated with troublemaking in school. Confirmed in both trials, treatment effects cut Black-White suspension and office disciplinary referral gaps during seventh and eighth grade by approximately two thirds, with even greater impacts for Black students with prior infractions.",

Concerns about the transition led districts to suspend the use of value-added scores for evaluating teachers, but changes to other measures, such as classroom observations, were rare. Using data from the Washington, DC Public Schools, I evaluate the effect of the assessment transition on teachers' practice. I find substantial declines in instructional practice, ranging from 13% to 20% of a standard deviation, for teachers in tested grades and subjects when the new exam was introduced. These results suggest that policymakers should consider the ramifications of testing changes on a wider array of teaching outcomes than value-added scores alone.",

Drawing on critical literacy (Vasquez et al., 2019) and prolepsis (Cole, 1993), we describe how collaborative, creative, and pedagogical writing supported them in envisioning, enacting, and leading liberatory literacy pedagogies within and beyond their schools.

We identified an approach we called &quot;flexible specificity&quot;--flexibility informed by ongoing data collection and evaluation that allowed districts to develop specific, useful guidance about curriculum and professional learning based on stakeholder needs.

In this paper, we examine a sociotechnical system called Science Everywhere, which invited the broader community to interact with science learning experiences youths shared across home, school, and community settings. Integrating frameworks for disposition and asset-based community development, we present a case study of four focal adults within Science Everywhere embedded in one neighborhood. We make the case for a relational perspective of disposition development that leverages community members' science and relational assets to foster dynamic, community-specific learning opportunities for youths, particularly those from resource-constrained communities.",

        "description":"Positive perceptions of school climate correlate with many dimensions of academic well-being and student health. Unfortunately, some existing research finds more favorable perceptions in middle school for general education students (GENs) than for students with disabilities (SWDs). Given the importance of ninth grade to student success, it is important to know if perceptions improve when students go to high school, if they improve more for GENs than SWDs, and if they are mediated by school characteristics. Our analysis of rich student-level longitudinal data suggests that students perceive improvements in school climate when they transition to high school, school characteristics do mediate perceptions, and perceptions of GENs improve more (or decline less) than those of SWDs, resulting in gaps favoring GENs.",

        "description":"Residence halls are consequential spaces for many college students and purport to offer comfort, community, and home while facilitating meaningful learning opportunities, including interaction across difference. This qualitative case study uses theories of white space to examine campus housing at three historically white universities. Findings juxtapose staff's and administrators' relatively harmonious and idyllic beliefs about community with Students of Color's experiences in campus residence halls. Across campuses, Students of Color's sense of comfort and belonging in residence halls was ruptured by racist expression, speech, and an overwhelming presence of white people. Findings illuminate how residence halls often functioned as white spaces, where white students were disproportionately entitled to comfort, safety, and belonging. Implications for research and practice are discussed.",

        "description":"Black students face hyper-disciplining and high levels of social control when they enter American schools. The cultural mismatch hypothesis attempts to explain this hyper-disciplining by arguing that the mostly White teaching force misinterprets the attitudes and behaviors of Black students, which leads to their hyper-disciplining. Utilizing a longitudinal, deeply iterative, participatory, and critical ethnographic research process, however, this article shows that traditional scholarship around the cultural mismatch hypothesis is insufficient. The analysis indicates that teachers' misinterpretation of mismatched capital (the traditional cultural mismatch hypothesis) is actually a racialized interpretation of both matched and mismatched capital coming from Black students, and such racialized interpretations are guided by the logic of antiblackness endemic to American institutions. Hence, this research argues for the integration of antiblackness as a theoretical tool to expand upon cultural mismatch explanations and for the creation of educational spaces where Black students are recognized, valued, and treated with dignity and humanization.",

The results of our analysis point to substantial variation, especially between the state's two largest authorizers: Ball State University and the Indianapolis Mayor's Office. Some of the variation is driven by the types of operators these bodies authorize to run charter schools. However, operator effects are not consistent across authorizers, suggesting a more complex story about how authorization affects student achievement. These results point to the ways that public and private interests in charter schools may complicate the work of authorizers and suggest a need for policymakers to offer more guidance in how authorizers carry out their various accountability mandates.",

        "description":"While there is no shortage of scholarship on &quot;equity&quot; in higher education, researchers typically examine whether a policy or practice is (in)equitable rather than how those responsible for designing and enacting a policy or practice make meaning of equity. Using a sensemaking framework and case study approach, I explored the collective meaning-making of practitioners at one community college during a time of increased policy attention to equity. Despite lacking a formal definition after 2 years of meaning-making, practitioners labeled specific ideas and activities as equity, suggesting the development of an implicit understanding. From this case, I offer five lessons to propose the concept of &quot;equity sense,&quot; a practitioner-constructed, contextually bounded meaning with implications for practice, policy, and research.",
