      <str>Hodgkins, Andrew</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines the precarious learning-to-work transitions experienced by aboriginal youth in the Canadian oil sands mining industry. Drawing from an empirical case study of a mine-sponsored, pre-apprenticeship training programme, challenges experienced by programme participants, as well as their socialisation into the world of work are examined. As a group that is considered &amp;quot;at-risk,&amp;quot; aboriginal youth in resource rich regions are also vulnerable to being targeted as a source of racialised labour by companies who want to appease local resentment over land dispossession and environmental pollution occurring on traditional lands. Informed by the sociology of Pierre Bourdieu and the concept of &amp;quot;vocational habitus,&amp;quot; the inquiry critically examines the sets of dispositions that become embodied in training participants, which I argue align with the reputational risk management objectives of the sponsoring company.</str>

    <str name="title">Youth Insecurity in Schools: What's Going on with Class?</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Smyth, John</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Young people from working-class backgrounds are feeling increasingly insecure in school, and for good reasons. The institution of schooling is being converted into an instrument of neoliberal control. In this paper, I discuss how schools are becoming increasingly insecure places for working-class young people, and how they are responding, and I do this in four parts; first, through the construction of a particular kind of classed learning identity; second, I make the case for why we need a more explicit focus on social class in schooling; third, I pursue how working-class students are being taught to &amp;quot;learn their place&amp;quot; in school, and what this means for sociological analysis; and finally, in moving beyond a bleak and deterministic interpretation, I provide some examples of counter-storytelling to illustrate how working-class culture &amp;quot;speaks back&amp;quot; to the institution of schooling. [This paper was originally presented as a keynote address to the 'Youth, insecurity and education' international seminar, University of Huddersfield, UK, 16th June 2015.]</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Carpenter, Sara</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines the use of logic models in the development of community initiatives within the AmeriCorps program. AmeriCorps is the civilian national service programme in the U.S., operating as a grants programme to local governments and not-for-profit organisations and providing low-cost labour to address pressing issues of social inequality. Logic models are a popular tool in programme planning, which graphically illustrates the relationship between a programme's goals, resources expenditures and expected outcomes. Drawing from institutional ethnographic data, this paper examines how the use of logic models within the programme planning process create particular modes of defining and intervening in the achievement gap, thus shaping interventions by youth workers at the level of individual behaviour and obscuring structural roots forms of inequality. It is argued that in such &amp;quot;technologies&amp;quot; of neoliberalism, we can understand how neoliberal public policy works to influence interventions at the community level.</str>

    <str name="title">The Muslim Problematic: Muslims, State Schools and Security</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Miah, Shamim</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Muslims are folk-devils that mark the ubiquitous moral panic. For some, the idea of the &amp;quot;Muslim problematic&amp;quot; signifies a long and worrying trend of creeping &amp;quot;Islamification&amp;quot; of state schools. For others, the discourse of the &amp;quot;Muslim problematic&amp;quot; reflects the ongoing racial patholigisation of Britain's minoritised communities. One thing is for certain, the current debate marks a significant moment in the nature and function of the neoliberal state as it reframes race relation policy in Britain in the light of the security agenda. The Trojan Horse affair, surrounding claims of infiltration of radical Islam in state-run schools, marks a significant moment in the embedding of the security agenda in Britain's inner city schools through the medium of the Prevent agenda. It argues that one of the best ways of understanding the security agenda is by locating it within a broader sociological and historical context of the functioning of the racial state.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper reports the findings of an eight-month ethnographic study of a small group of at-risk youths in a school of a southern coastal city in China. The process leading to the young students being marginalised by the school system and how they developed a &amp;quot;muddling through&amp;quot; subculture to counteract this marginalisation is revealed. It is argued that this small group of at-risk youths has capitalised on their subculture and used it to resist authorities, to acquire social skills and to safeguard their psychological well-being. The present study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, the in-depth description of the subculture of a group of at-risk youths in a Chinese school provides a Chinese angle for youth (post-) subculture studies. Second, the critical discussion about the &amp;quot;empowerment&amp;quot; role that the &amp;quot;deviant&amp;quot; subculture plays enriches the literature about the functions of youth culture.</str>

    <str name="description">During the past years, combating truancy has been high on the political agenda. However, throughout Europe one can observe that despite the numerous action plans and anti-truancy measures, truancy rates continue to rise. In this article, we focus on Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) as a case study to get a better grip on the mismatch between the general truancy policy and the everyday reality of truancy. Based on the analysis of (1) official registration data and 2013 survey data with pupils from grade 9-12 (N = 4189), (2) survey data from 62 principals of Flemish secondary schools and (3) 28 in-depth interviews with occasional and frequent truants, this article argues that the current emphasis on the registration with the aim of (early) detecting and intervening in truancy cases actually results in a disengagement of teachers and schools to deal with truancy in a responsive manner.</str>

    <str name="description">Access to higher education is affected by inequalities worldwide. Here we present a longitudinal study based on large databases of scores in upper secondary education and access to higher education in Portugal. Our findings show how access to higher education builds on and reinforces social inequalities: (1) private, fee-paying secondary schools inflate their students' scores; (2) this inflation unfairly improves their chances of accessing higher education; (3) the Portuguese national compensatory education programme is ineffective in bridging the gap in academic performance between the less privileged and the rest of the schools. This study, then, provides further insights into how the upper classes are disproportionately benefited by the massification of higher education. To achieve greater equity, issues such as the State supervision of grading practices, the assessment and reconfiguration of compensatory education programmes, and the admission process into higher education have to be addressed.</str>

    <str name="description">The Czech education system is characterised by early tracking and high educational inequalities. The most controversial element of the system is the academic track, which is attended by students after the completion of primary school. The paper focuses on fifth graders' application process and their success in entrance examinations. The process is examined by binary logistic regression and descriptive analyses of the data collected in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study conducted in 2011 in grade 4, and in a survey of students attending grade 5 implemented on the same sample within the Czech Longitudinal Study in Education. The analyses show that students' family background has a significant effect on both application and success during admission procedures. The paper discusses the role of the family in the application process and in preparation for the entrance examinations, and compares the situation in the Czech Republic with that in other countries.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Based on a qualitative study conducted in austerity-stricken Greece, the paper provides a micro-level exploration of the mechanics of intergenerational transmission of (dis)advantage. Utilising the Bourdieusian toolbox, the paper enquires into familial practices through the lens of young people's perceptions, focusing on the mobilisation of capitals, the inculcation and transformation of habitus taking place in the Greek educational field. In-depth interview material unpacks the pedagogic efforts young people and their families make, indicating that these are contingent on the varied volume and composition of capitals and the distinct distances from necessity that in turn constrain or afford the exercise of agency and the investments in the academic market. Further, the analysis sheds light on young people's accounts of educational and occupational expectations illustrating how these are tightly interweaved with familial legacies and parental wishes, and underpinned by the projects of distinction, mobility and respectability through education.</str>

These &amp;quot;CPGEs,&amp;quot; originally intended to educate the children of the social and cultural elite, are now accepting young people from more diverse social backgrounds. Our investigation of this &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; student population is based on a survey (1000 students and 350 teachers) and on interviews conducted with students (82) and teaching staff (24). Our research leads us to conclude that under the pretext of democratisation and adaptation to the labour market, &amp;quot;CPGEs&amp;quot; recruiting these new students are, paradoxically, helping to maintain social stratification.</str>

    <str name="description">School failure is substantive in Spain. The percentage of students that do not achieve the compulsory education diploma is around 20%. School failure is higher for students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Students who &amp;quot;fail&amp;quot; cannot continue to post-compulsory education and, sooner or later, they have to leave formal education. The evolution of school failure in Spain follows a U-shaped curve that decreases from the seventies and rises from the end of the past century. This article explores the evolution of the impact of students' socio-economic backgrounds on school failure from the seventies onwards and tests whether this impact increased at the end of last century. Using logit models of estimation to control for socio-demographic factors, we demonstrate that students from higher socio-economic backgrounds show fewer fluctuations in school failure than students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. We also provide evidence in support of an increase in the impact of socio-economic background on school failure from the end of the past century, thereby increasing differences by social origin of students. Our paper is consistent with previous literature showing that the impact of socio-economic background on school failure from the seventies onwards is declining. Nevertheless, we show an increase in this impact from the late nineties not described before. We offer a possible explanation for this upward trend in the shape of change in the institutional structure of the education system, although labour market incentives may also have played a role.</str>

    <str name="description">Looking to conflicting constitutions of education systems through the terms equality and excellence, this paper examines the discursive formation of two political rationalities in the contemporary German education system. While early childhood and primary education discourses are dominated by a terminology of equality, tertiary education institutions such as universities are described using a terminology of excellence that has become a reference point for political interventions and institutional reform processes. Drawing from hegemony theory, governmentality studies and systems theory, this paper analyses the rules of justification referred to by such hegemonic discourses. It presents a policy discourse analysis of strategic, conceptional and institutional texts produced between 2003 and 2010. Through this analysis, the paper suggests that &amp;quot;mobilising&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;optimising&amp;quot; represent the common principles of equality and excellence as economic rationalities.</str>

      <str>Park, Jae</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This theoretical paper begins with a reflection on the dominant conceptions of &amp;quot;high ability&amp;quot;, based on psychometrics, and examines claims that the ethos of a particular cultural heritage is essential to what &amp;quot;high ability&amp;quot; signifies. The article semantically distinguishes &amp;quot;giftedness&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;ability&amp;quot;, using research on &amp;quot;Confucian heritage culture&amp;quot; with its &amp;quot;thick&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;thin&amp;quot; dimensions. &amp;quot;Giftedness&amp;quot; here means an inherited quality or endowment. &amp;quot;Ability&amp;quot;, on the other hand, signifies an active process open to nurture through education and--what could account for the main contribution of this paper--the role played by an &amp;quot;epistemology of heart-mind&amp;quot; in Confucian heritage. The article argues that this epistemology of heart-mind constitutes a generational collective programming of mind. Such a definition could lead to a sociocultural conception of intelligence and giftedness open to development, adding a new perspective to the conceptualisation of giftedness and high ability.</str>

    <str name="title">Recognising Ethnic Identity in the Classroom: A New Zealand Study</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Siteine, Alexis</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The recognition and affirmation of student identity in New Zealand primary schools is a policy requirement. While directives for its implementation are found in the current national curriculum, little, if any, guidance is given about what this means or how it might look in classroom programmes. This paper discusses a study concerning the beliefs, understandings and practices of teachers as they interpret the curriculum related to the identity directive. The findings indicate that a marked divergence exists between the identity directive encoded into the curriculum and the way in which teachers decode and enact the directive in their practice. This article argues that two unintended effects are produced as a result of this divergence. First, rather than promote the affirmation of student identity, the enactment of this directive might, in fact, lead to ethnic division. Second, attempts to recognise and affirm identity have led to the displacement of school subject knowledge in classroom programmes. These unintended outcomes are not only unacknowledged, but they continue to disadvantage the community the identity directive was intended to address.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lim, Leonel</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Drawing upon Bernstein's writings on the pedagogic device, this article examines how critical thinking is regulated in Singapore through the process of pedagogic recontextualization. The potential of critical thinking to speak to alternative possibilities and notions of individual autonomy as well as its assumptions of a liberal arrangement of society are problematized in Singapore. By documenting how such curricular discourses are articulated by the state and taken up in schools and classrooms, the article provides a sociological account of the relations between the organization of knowledge and the distribution of social power and control. The analysis reveals that even as official understandings of critical thinking are transmitted in the classroom, alternative, non-official orders of meaning are inevitably made available. Showing how teachers and students act to resist and challenge these prescribed understandings the article argues that the very ideas of change and indeterminacy are fundamentally built into the pedagogic device.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores how teachers in a poor township primary school in South Africa construct meaning regarding gender violence among children, and how they talk about addressing that violence. The paper argues that major influences on the endemic violence include complex societal structures that are inscribed with cultures of violent masculinities, extreme socio-economic conditions and gender inequality. It shows how primary school teachers recognise violent masculinities and gender power imbalances but simultaneously uphold the notion of children's innocence as a rationale for refuting the primary school as a site of violence. The paper explores contradictions embedded in some of the solutions which the teachers suggest as a way of addressing violence. For example, while they highlight the importance of teaching peace, respect and equality, they also advocate the use of corporal punishment as an effective means of dealing with violent conduct among school children.</str>

    <str name="description">This article presents an argument for re-reading Jean Baudrillard's ideas considering their potential contribution to the sociology of higher education, particularly in relation to contemporary debates about &amp;quot;world-class&amp;quot; universities. In order to apply Baudrillard's ideas, China's commitment to the development of &amp;quot;world-class&amp;quot; universities is presented as a case study. Radical thinking, as understood by Baudrillard, relies on ambivalence and fascination--instead of critique--and seeks to push a logic to its limits rather than opposing it. Critiques of world-class universities have not stopped the totalizing effects of rankings and world-class status seeking; on the contrary, these phenomena and their effects continue to accelerate. A non-deterministic approach to thinking is set into motion around the paroxystic state that prevails in the pursuit of &amp;quot;world-class&amp;quot; status among contemporary higher education systems.</str>

    <str name="description">Families have been getting more and more involved in their children's education. This paper presents findings of a study investigating family involvement in their members' undergraduate studies attending a state (non-fee-paying) and a private (fee-paying) university in Cyprus. The data presented in the paper were collected via online logs completed by administrative personnel in the two universities documenting incidents of family involvement. The data analysis demonstrates how similarly the phenomenon manifests in both universities and suggests that where the two universities differ is more in the intensity of the various modes of family involvement. It also projects students' desires and encouragement of their family's involvement and their families' intervention to protect or guide them. The findings of the study are discussed in view of cultural and societal norms and changes about parenthood and the relationship between families and their university age members in a marketized higher education context.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Despite decades of research and policy, we are still some way in the U.K. from ameliorating barriers for Gypsy and Traveller pupils. A complex set of factors exist which influence young people's engagement with secondary education. This interpretive-deductive study, which draws upon 'tensions and dilemmas of difference', presents Gypsy/Traveller learners' perceptions and those of their parents and teachers about the barriers encountered. Findings around 'intra-cultural conflict' demonstrate significant tensions between and within cultures that are profound for young people during this stage of education. Resilient, supportive mothers and strong bonds with teachers and children from the mainstream community, appeared essential in helping young people to manage criticism and resist pressure to conform to cultural norms. However, a fundamental shift in societal attitude is required and critical thought paid to inclusive education, or young learners who remain in education may end up on the periphery of both societies.</str>

    <str name="title">The Rural-Urban Divide, Intergroup Relations, and Social Identity Formation of Rural Migrant Children in a Chinese Urban School</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Zhang, Donghui</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Through ethnographic fieldwork conducted at a Beijing public school, this study aims to investigate how rural migrant children in China negotiate and construct their identity vis-à-vis the school's local children. Building on social identity theory, this study reveals that rural migrant children develop a strong non-local group identity as a response to the Hukou-based social policy and the occupation-based social hierarchies in contemporary China. Such an identity helps migrant children combat a sense of inferiority that is reinforced by their daily interactions with the socially and economically more advantaged urban peers. However, this group-based identity forestalls intergroup contact and prevents the migrant children from successfully integrating into Chinese urban society.</str>

    <str name="description">This article uses the case of Bulgarian, predominantly Roma, schools to illustrate the long history of stereotypes about Roma people dating back to modernity's discursive binary oppositions of 'civilized' vs. 'barbarians.' The data from a longitudinal study with 12 Bulgarian educators showed the modes by which Roma as the Other is created in the school context as a universal cognitive category, internalized in social and individual identities that divide the world into 'us' and 'them.' The paper argues that Bulgarian teachers' perceptions of attitudes, behavior, and values of Roma communities are, in fact, a projection of the discursive representations with which western European modernity has constructed the Balkan region. This research contributes to further explicating how the ideological paradigm of neoliberalism intersects with the old Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment dichotomy of civilized-barbarians and how it is reconfigured to construct those incapable of fitting within the entrepreneurial spirit of the free market efficiency as unwilling to democratize. The case of Bulgarian, predominantly Roma, schools serves to illustrate how peoples who are Othered in the western European discourse designate their own Other, and thus provides a fruitful approach to understanding how Roma's social exclusion is constructed and situated.</str>

    <str name="description">Previous studies identify a relationship between education and anti-immigrant attitudes. There is, however, uncertainty regarding the underlying explanations linking education to attitudes. In this article, we examine whether a relationship exists between exposure to teaching about critical thinking as well as multiculturalism (measured as religions/cultures as well as xenophobia/racism), and anti-immigrant attitudes among adolescents. In addition, we examine whether teacher qualification matters for attitudes. The analysis is based on survey data collected from high school students in Sweden. The results show an association between exposure to teaching about critical thinking as well as multiculturalism (both indicators) and anti-immigrant attitudes among students, i.e. higher exposure is related to lower levels of anti-immigrant attitudes. However, we find that teaching about xenophobia/racism affects attitudes, but not when simultaneously controlling for teaching about critical thinking and religions/cultures. In terms of teacher qualification, we find that students in schools with a high proportion of certified teachers tend to have lower levels of anti-immigrant attitudes.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper presents a theoretical argument regarding the power of school to shape parental involvement in culturally informed ways. The paper emerges out of preliminary fieldwork among Jewish middle-class parents in a town in northern Israel, during which our attention was drawn to the intense activity in and around their children's transition to primary school. This activity became a lens for the exploration and articulation of a theoretical claim, according to which parental involvement is not just a matter of the fit or lack of fit between the cultural capital imported from home into school, as posited by much of the relevant literature. Rather, the cultural shaping of parental involvement takes place &amp;quot;within and through&amp;quot; encounters between school and family: by means of the school's cultivation of &amp;quot;proper&amp;quot; disposition and comportment for parents, the power of emotional community and the recruitment of a key cultural symbol.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper seeks to question what impact education vouchers have on the process of school choice. The context examined in the paper is the Pre-primary Education Voucher Scheme (&amp;quot;Voucher Scheme&amp;quot;) introduced in 2007 in Hong Kong. Using a Straussian grounded theory method, data collected from 40 parent interviews are coded, analysed and developed into categories. The paper analytically situates the findings within a model, derived from the data, which is based on two properties: &amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;time&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Orientation&amp;quot; differentiates and emphasises the significance of choice factors in relation to the school versus the family, and &amp;quot;time&amp;quot; is related to focus on the present versus the future. The paper subsequently presents the data related to these properties and reflects on the intricate dynamic of parents' school choice decisions under the Voucher Scheme.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Rowe, Emma E.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Research points to sections of the middle-class repopulating the &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; urban public school and whilst there are key differences in how they are navigating public school choices, from &amp;quot;seeking a critical mass&amp;quot; to resisting traditional methods of choice and going &amp;quot;against-the-grain&amp;quot;, or collectively campaigning for a brand new public school, the urban middle-class are developing contemporary methods to challenge the existing ways of thinking about middle-class choice. Drawing on this literature, this paper explores the symbolism of public schooling for relatively affluent choosers in the city of Melbourne, Australia. The positioning of public schooling as essentially secular and liberal indicates how the public school is valorised within the contemporary market place. Within a market that tends to undersell the public school, the perceived lack of organised religion and progressivism may be the unique selling point for the cosmopolitan, globalised consumer.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Gurney, Eleanor</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Drawing on qualitative interview data from a group of lower income parents in Delhi, India, this paper focuses on the dynamic relationship between parental choice of a particular school and parents' own identity construction. The data indicate that choice of school is for some parents a symbolic expression of identity, influenced by family dynamics and parents' educational biographies. The paper outlines the concept of &amp;quot;forging solidarities&amp;quot; and proposes it as an alternative way of understanding school enrolment decisions that recognises the social significance of such choices for the wider family unit. More generally, as school choice mechanisms in various forms become an increasingly important part of the educational landscape in many countries, the findings draw attention to the sociocultural nature of choice in real-world market settings and the contribution of schooling choices to processes of social and educational segregation.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Bates, Agnieszka</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The last 20 years has witnessed the spread of corporatism in education on a global scale. In England, this trend is characterised by new structural and cultural approaches to education found in the &amp;quot;academies&amp;quot; programme and the adoption of private sector management styles. The corporate re-imagining of schools has also led to the introduction into the curriculum of particular forms of character education aimed at managing the &amp;quot;emotional labour&amp;quot; of children. This paper argues that character education rests on a fallacy that the development of desirable character traits in children can be engineered by mimicking certain behaviours from the adult world. The weaknesses in the corporate approach to managing &amp;quot;emotional labour&amp;quot; are illustrated with empirical data from two primary schools. An alternative paradigm is presented which locates the &amp;quot;emotional labour&amp;quot; of children within a &amp;quot;holding environment&amp;quot; that places children's well-being at its core.</str>

    <str name="description">The mechanisms of discipline and power within the institution of the school constitute, in part, the relationship between society and childhood. This article traces the relationship between official regulative discourses of control and punishment practices over students in primary school. It focuses on the memories of schooling of first-year students in a Department of Primary Education at a Greek University. The concepts of power, discipline and discourse from the theory of Michel Foucault are drawn on to examine the pedagogical control over primary school pupils. The research was carried out using an open questionnaire in which participants were asked to describe their experiences of school punishment. The key findings showed that corporal punishment is dominant in the memory of the majority of research participants. The reason for the pupils' punishment was mainly their making noise in the classroom and their poor performance in core subjects of the curriculum. These findings are significant for the sociology of education as they reveal the real and symbolic violence of school life that endures in memories of childhood, schooling and society.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper is a qualitative consideration of how working-class mothers manage money, daily life, their children's education and, in the process, internalise a particularistic economic position. It is uncommon that educational sociology incorporates a critical engagement of the daily drudge of extending money, and the implications of managing the varied and frequent costs of keeping children at school. I draw on Bourdieu's model of practice and particularly that of the economic habitus. For these mothers, &amp;quot;making do&amp;quot; refers not only to stretching the economic but to mental dispositions that emerge out of negotiating the economic, &amp;quot;not as a universe of possibles … but rather … impassable barriers&amp;quot;. The data reveals in wider and narrower cycles how economic conditions are foregrounded in the doing of ordinary life and in lives of heightened economic difficulty planning, or calculating dispositions towards the future are curtailed.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper analyses the kinds of capital, practices and investments that are implicated in the participation of migrant mothers in the educational careers of their children, drawing on a Bourdieusian framework. We present findings of a study of Muslim Iraqi mothers with school-aged children in Australia, based on 47 interviews with 25 participants. The study identifies different modes of involvement in children's education and connects these to mothers' cultural and social capital. Involvement, and its effectiveness, is analysed through the analytical categories of (i) high capital-high involvement; (ii) low capital-high involvement; and (iii) low capital-minimal direct involvement. The paper contributes to the theorisation of family-school relations in the context of migration, and develops a more nuanced perspective for studying social class positioning and repositioning.</str>

    <str name="description">Mature students' experiences of learning and teaching on Access to Higher Education course are coloured by their socio-economic backgrounds, their prior experiences of learning and their relationships with their tutors. After giving informed consent, 60 students and 20 tutors across seven colleges in a region of England in 2012-2013 took part in interviews on these topics, the former group on three occasions during the academic year. A further 500 students across the colleges completed two questionnaires during the year. Qualitative data were analysed inductively. Quantitative data were analysed with simple descriptive statistics. Findings suggest that students preferred tutors who treated them respectfully, modelled effective learning practices clearly and empowered them to be independent learners. They also welcomed working collaboratively with their fellow students and being supported by the institutions they attended.</str>

    <str name="description">Using a Bernsteinian theoretical framework, this study compares two American early childhood centres, one with a primarily progressive pedagogy (Frank Lloyd Wright Family Centre) and one with a primarily traditional pedagogy (Casimir Pulaski Centre), in high-poverty Chicago neighbourhoods to examine the effects of different pedagogic practices on the development of academic and non-academic skills in young children as measured by pre- and post-testing and observations over five months. The collected data demonstrate that students at Wright experienced greater levels of academic development than students at Pulaski. Children at both sites showed development in literacy and social/emotional skills, but the children at Wright also show development in problem-solving and imagination--skills that aid in abstract thought. While further study is needed on a broader scale, results from this study suggest that early childhood programmes with more progressive elements have the potential to better prepare children for elementary school than programmes with more traditional elements.</str>

    <str name="title">Citizenship Education in Mexico: The Depoliticisation of Adolescence through Secondary School</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Pérez-Expósito, Leonel</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Recent contributions have argued about the depoliticisation of citizenship education (CE), mainly through theoretical and documentary analyses, and based on the European context. Nonetheless, there is a lack of field studies which can provide empirical evidence about how does the depoliticisation of CE actually operate. Based on a mixed-method research in Mexico City's secondary schools, this paper shows how the contemporary approach to CE, instead of looking at nurturing children's and adolescents' politicity, contributes to pupils' depoliticisation. Among different potential characterisations of political participation (PP), the curriculum of CE circumscribes it within the arena of formal politics, from which students are largely excluded in the present. Additionally, CE promotes a range of practices of participation which are deprived from a political meaning. Students appropriate them discursively, but perceive limited opportunities for perform them, especially in school. Through the depoliticisation of CE, adolescents mostly learn that PP is a promise of inclusion in the future, while the idea of active citizenship becomes reduced to a correct discourse about largely imperceptible practices in students' everyday life. The article stresses the need of shifting the priority of CE in Mexico from the formal curriculum to the transformation of school practices, in order to develop students' politicity through participation.</str>

    <str name="description">Intercultural interaction plays an important role in contributing to international students' learning and wellbeing in the host country. While research on international students' intercultural interactions reveals multifaceted aspects of personal and social factors, there is a tendency to consider language barrier and cultural differences as individual factors that constrain their interactions with the institutional community. Drawing on 105 interviews with international students in Australian vocational education and training and dual sector institutions, this paper examines international students' intercultural interactions in host institutions and the factors that act as enablers or inhibitors for intercultural interactions. It highlights the social and structural conditions in creating symbolic capital of elitist Anglo-Australian culture and English language, and social differentiation. This paper offers insights into understanding the legitimacy of such elitism, in hope that future conceptualisation, research and practices of intercultural interactions may locate international students within their cultural diversity.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper utilises the conceptual lens of intersectionality to explore gendered academic career trajectory in the context of one participant's challenge to a normative reading of the link between her private life and its relation to a &amp;quot;successful&amp;quot; academic career. The paper then charts the recalibrations that needed to take place to ensure certain sociocultural categories and intersections were not privileged over others. Finally, the paper then utilises the concept of intersectionality as a metaphor with which to view the intersecting and reflexive relationship between the interviewer, the interviewee and the performative event of the interview process.</str>

    <str name="description">Private tutoring (PT) is becoming a worldwide phenomenon. In Israel too, about a third of elementary school students participate in PT. Based on sociological and school quality considerations, we examined school characteristics that are associated with PT intensity at school. The data encompassed a random state wide sample of 389 Israeli elementary schools collected by the Ministry of Education in 2012. The results showed that in high school socioeconomic status (SES) schools the percentage of students who participated in PT was higher compared to low SES schools. In high SES, schools with high PT intensity were characterized by high school achievements whereas in low SES, schools were characterized with low school achievements. PT seems to be a factor that increases the social distinction between high and low SES schools. In Israel, PT seems to create distinct &amp;quot;school enclaves&amp;quot; that reproduce social inequality.</str>

    <str name="description">Gender differences in mathematical performance have received considerable scrutiny in the fields of sociology, economics and psychology. We analyse a large data-set of high school graduates who took a standardised mathematical test in Russia in 2011 (n = 738,456) and find no substantial difference in mean test scores across boys and girls. However, boys have a greater variance of scores and are more numerous at the top of the distribution. We apply quantile regression to model the association between school characteristics and gender differences in test scores throughout the distribution of test scores. Male advantage in test scores, particularly at the top of the distribution, is concentrated in cities and in the schools with an advanced curriculum. In other high schools, especially in the countryside, gender differences in all parts of the distribution are small. We suggest several mechanisms based on selection and school effects that account for our findings.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper utilises ideas of correspondence as a way of thinking about intersections between school and work in Singapore's developmental state. Whereas the principle of correspondence predicts segregated patterns of association between school and work, this paper shows how a developmentalist form of political economy gives rise to crosscutting, rather than segregated patterns of school-to-work correspondences among the elite. Although the correspondence principle treats education and economy as major elements, it fails to consider what is arguably a far more revolutionary force--namely the state, which ultimately frames and mediates the pathways elite students take from school to work.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper draws upon the sociology of numbers, particularly work by Theodore Porter, to reveal the multifarious ways in which numbers actively constitute practices in schools. Drawing upon a case study of one low-performing school in a low-performing region in the state of Queensland, Australia, and theorising into the sociology of numbers, the research explores the complex ways in which numbers came to constitute and dominate the practices in this school site under a broader national, state and regional policy context demanding rapid improvements in various forms of standardised tests and associated practices. Specifically, the research reveals a strong and simultaneous focus by teachers upon a variety of numeric data collected at national, regional and local levels, and intricate relations between these data; multiple visualisation, triangulation and comparison approaches towards such data in virtual and physical formats; and the enumerative nominalisation of both students and their reading attainment in relation to specific, concretised levels of achievement and various types of scale scores. The research cautions against the sheer volume of such enumerative practices, which, while productive of teachers' understandings of student capacity against standardised measures of achievement, may also lead to a more reductive view of education, dominated by concerns about achievement in standardised tests (and associated practices) alone.</str>

    <str name="description">The paper seeks to understand the trajectories of students who defer entry to university. The study was conducted in Lithuania, a former Soviet Union republic. The phenomenon of a &amp;quot;gap year&amp;quot; is usually associated with young people, who decide not to enter higher education schools immediately after receiving secondary education, instead they choose to spend a year volunteering, working or engaging in other activities. This article analyses the choice of taking a gap year from the perspective of rational choice theory, complemented by human development theory, which was developed by R. Inglehart and his colleagues. The latter theory allows discovering relation between the spreading of the gap year phenomenon in developed European countries and the emergence as well as development of post-materialist values from the macro-level perspective. The theoretical analysis is based on semi-structured interview data collected in Lithuania.</str>

    <str name="title">Extending Sociological Theorising on High Ability: The Significance of Values and Lived Experience</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Mazzoli Smith, Laura</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Sociological work on high ability is framed by social constructionist theorising and/or takes a social justice approach, and hence particular analytical intellectual traditions are foregrounded. Whilst these approaches have contributed the main critique of essentialist psychological understandings of high ability, they can eclipse normative discourses and the ethically situated meaning of high ability for individuals. This paper explores why epistemological questions about high ability cannot be separated from values-based ones and assesses where this has happened in relation to sociological approaches to high ability. It suggests that a narrative approach is one way of enriching sociological theories and discourses of high ability and that this can progress not only sociological, but interdisciplinary theorising in the field.</str>

    <str name="description">Gifted education is leading an interdisciplinary paradigm shift moving education out of its historic role of entrenching systemic inequities. It is a crucible for pioneering investigations of optimal human development and provides a vehicle for increasing social equity. We review changing conceptions of intelligence, motivation and creativity, and consider current findings on processes that affect the development of high ability. We discuss the role of context and neuroscience as they apply to understanding the development of giftedness. We describe changing emphases in gifted education, focusing on the shift from categorical homogeneity to developmental diversity, concluding that giftedness and talent are best understood as dynamic, fluid, domain-specific and context-sensitive processes. Finally, we consider implications for educational practice: How do these changes impact definition, prediction, identification, programming, psychosocial practices and teacher development, opening up opportunities for optimal learning, development and fulfillment across the population, and across the life span?</str>

    <str name="description">This paper proposes the development of an enhanced sense of social responsibility in the use of talents and the creation of programmes and services that focus on the promotion of these traits among a wider student population. Selection of students for these offerings should not mirror the rigid identification of academically or intellectually gifted individuals and the focus should be on the &amp;quot;creation&amp;quot; of socially responsible high performers as opposed to &amp;quot;finding&amp;quot; the gifted.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Stark, Lauren</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper offers a conceptual analysis of ability discourse using the theoretical lens of critical whiteness studies and the methodological framework of critical discourse analysis. From its origins in the Progressive Era to contemporary debates on tracking, the concept of giftedness has been formed through racial projects throughout US history. Through these projects, the concept of &amp;quot;giftedness&amp;quot; became synonymous with &amp;quot;whiteness&amp;quot;, and gifted education has served to maintain white privilege both within and between US schools. While counter-discourse on giftedness has been dominated by scholars working outside the field of gifted education, there is a growing critique of this concept within the field of gifted education.</str>

    <str name="description">The label &amp;quot;gifted&amp;quot; has been a source of contention for decades, possibly because it seems to imply a desirable status that is mysteriously granted to some yet remains unavailable to others. Some writers have suggested that the term should be abandoned altogether, though a replacement that retains the same utility for classification purposes and delivery of services remains elusive. We asked 106 parents of gifted learners about their usage of the term &amp;quot;gifted&amp;quot; to learn more about when they perceive the term to be useful and when or why they avoid using it. The majority of respondents reported avoiding the use of the gifted label in conversations with others who were not labelled. Findings suggest that these parents felt they or their children would be judged negatively by others if the parents used the term &amp;quot;gifted&amp;quot;, and that in many cases, they used alternate language or (for twice-exceptional children) gave priority to describing their child&amp;apos;s disability. Respondents who did choose to use the term framed their decision in terms of a need to educate other parents about giftedness as an important aspect of individual differences.</str>

    <str name="description">In recent years, early childhood education and care have gained increasing public attention. This has led to an expansion of education and care programmes. Yet, little is known about how parents use different options of education and care. Take, for example, kin care, paid caregivers and out-of-kindergarten activities. Drawing on social reproduction theory, we argue that parents organise their children's lives depending on their social class. In addition, we hypothesise that immigrant status plays a role in how parents set up their children's education and care. We use logit regression models to analyse the education and care arrangements of n?=?2400 parents with 3-5?year-olds in Germany. The findings show that parents from the middle and upper classes make more use of &amp;quot;enrichment activities&amp;quot; than lower and working class parents. When it comes to the influence of immigrant status and to informal care arrangements, the findings add to a more complex picture.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Young people who are not in education, employment or training (NEET) are construed by policy-makers as a pressing problem about which something should be done. Such young people's lack of employment is thought to pose difficulties for wider society in relation to social cohesion and inclusion, and it is feared that they will become a &amp;quot;lost generation&amp;quot;. This paper draws upon English research, seeking to historicise the debate whilst acknowledging that these issues have a much wider purchase. The notion of NEETs rests alongside longstanding concerns of the English state and middle classes, addressing unruly male working-class youth as well as the moral turpitude of working class girls. Waged labour and domesticity are seen as a means to integrate such groups into society thereby generating social cohesion. The paper places the debate within it socio-economic context and draws on theorisations of cognitive capitalism, Italian workerism, as well as emerging theories of antiwork to analyse these. It concludes by arguing that &amp;quot;radical&amp;quot; approaches to NEETs that point towards inequities embedded in the social structure and call for social democratic solutions veer towards a form of comfort radicalism. Such approaches leave in place the dominance of capitalist relations as well as productivist orientations that celebrate waged labour.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">By comparing the educational situation of second-generation Turks in the Netherlands and Austria, the paper investigates the reasons behind the differential higher educational gains of the descendants of guest workers in the two countries. By relying on in-depth interviews with second-generation Turks, the paper illustrates how ethnic discrimination in the labour market lead to maintaining a &amp;quot;sojourn-perspective&amp;quot; among Turks in the Austrian setting, who disapprove of long-term educational investments in favour of material resources enabling a potential return to Turkey. At the same time, the sojourn-orientation is giving way to a more long-term perspective in the case of the Netherlands, where Turkish families see investments in Dutch qualifications as worthwhile channels of upward mobility.</str>

    <str name="description">In the last two decades, higher education institutions have invested significant resources to internationalise, due to economic, political, academic and cultural pressures. Students play a dual role in this process: as customers, selecting institutions based on respective reputations (including the international dimension) and as outputs of institutional internationalisation processes aiming to produce internationally oriented graduates. Universities aspire towards integration of international, global and intercultural dimensions as main aims of higher education, reflecting the upsurging prominence of cosmopolitan capital among their future graduates. Indeed, cosmopolitanism is increasingly considered desirable on individual and institutional levels. Using data from a student survey (n = 1650) gathered at seven geographically and otherwise diverse colleges in Israel, this paper investigates Israeli college students' perceptions of internationalisation and estimation of their institutions' internationalisation activities. Parents' education, previous experiences abroad, proficiency in English and institutional efforts to internationalise were found to positively impact students' perceptions of on-campus internationalisation initiatives and characteristics. Such differences were also found to relate to the university's general status and context. This paper presents the findings of the survey and discusses possible implications for policy and practice at institutional and national levels.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>O'Boyle, Neil</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Research finds that participation in higher education is generally empowering for mature students but that it can also create tensions in their off-campus relationships. This article reports on findings from an ongoing study of the experiences of mature students at university in Ireland and draws from interviews with 15 such students in the final year of their studies. Following similar research by Baxter and Britton in the UK, the article considers how mature students experience and represent changes in identities and social relationships brought about by entry to higher education. Specifically, the article focuses on the risks associated with using newly acquired academic language (or &amp;quot;university speak&amp;quot;) off campus. The findings reported here complement existing research and offer support for Baxter and Britton's suggestion that mature students often experience compartmentalisation and fragmentation in their self-identities.</str>

    <str name="title">The Internationalisation Agenda: A Critical Examination of Internationalisation Strategies in Public Universities in Ghana</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Gyamera, Gifty Oforiwaa</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Recently, various strategies have been adopted and adapted by universities in Ghana to re/position themselves in the international arena. Utilising postcolonial and neoliberal theories, this paper critically examines the internationalisation strategies of three public universities in Ghana. Although all the universities have adopted strategies to position themselves internationally, the rates at which these strategies have been introduced differ from one university to the other. Various factors including location, size, age and infrastructural strength influence the rate of involvement. It is argued that the strategies adopted by the universities appear to be embedded in postcolonialism and economic rationales based mainly on neoliberal economic thinking, which sees higher education as a quasi market place where knowledge is bought and sold. The paper argues that universities need to adopt strategies that are proactive and that promote alternative notions of internationalisation in ways that challenge the status quo.</str>

    <str name="title">Working-Class Girls and Child-Centred Pedagogy: What Are the Implications for Developing Socially Just Pedagogy?</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Hempel-Jorgensen, Amelia</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Existing international research suggests that widespread performative pedagogy has contributed to producing educational inequalities for &amp;quot;disadvantaged&amp;quot; learners. There have also been calls for alternative pedagogies, which can be characterised as child-centred. This paper analyses pupils' hierarchical positioning in a contemporary, mixed socio-economic, child-centred classroom using Bernstein's theory of competence pedagogy and the concept of the ideal pupil. The ideal pupil's central characteristics were perceived &amp;quot;intelligence&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;good humour&amp;quot;, which were closely associated with middle-class boys. Middle-class and working-class girls were positioned against a female ideal pupil, who would take on a supporting role by creating a facilitating environment for boys' learning. While middle-class girls were moderately successful in approximating these characteristics, working-class girls were positioned at the bottom of the class hierarchy. These findings have implications for these pupils' self-perceptions, and raise questions about the implications of child-centred pedagogy for social justice.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Polkowska, Dominika</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In the contemporary scholarly discourse, the under-representation of women in science is often explained by the phenomenon of women &amp;quot;in the pipeline&amp;quot;. The pipeline carries a flow from one stage to another, and the flow of women diminishes between the stages. Based on the literature and qualitative studies, it can be inferred that one of the main causes of leaking in the pipeline is the difficulty in reconciling professional and family life by female scientists. Scientific work that requires mobility and competition forces numerous women to abandon their career or take a career break for the period of assuming different family roles. The results of a number of studies demonstrate that there are some differences between Polish women and their peers from other countries in achieving the work-family connection. It appears that after fulfilling a set of necessary conditions, the reconciliation of professional and family life is sometimes possible.</str>

    <str name="description">Transitions from education to work constitute a distinct set of situations where discrimination is likely to occur. Gender beliefs generally disadvantage women, and when coupled with beliefs regarding parental responsibility, tend to heavily disadvantage mothers. Yet we suggest that professional credentials create a divided labour market, with ameliorative effects. Credentials tend to match specifically to jobs and replace other means of determining the performance expectations of various job candidates. This should be especially true in the public sector, where hiring procedures are more transparent. As a result, we hypothesise that mothers with professional credentials will be less disadvantaged within the occupational market matched to their credentials, especially in the public sector. Data from Sweden, following 43,646 graduates with professional degrees into the labour market, generally support this interpretation, though substantial motherhood penalties remain in many professions. We briefly discuss the implications of these findings.</str>

    <str name="description">Relying on the results of the achievement tests in mathematics, science, native language (Hebrew/Arabic) and English, administered to 1430 5th-grade co-educational classes in Israel, this study examines the between-class variability of the within-class mean score gender differences and its class and school correlates. The four main results of the study are: (1) remarkable between-test stability of the within-class gender gap; (2) considerable variability of the within-class gender gap, in terms of both sign and magnitude, found for each of the four tests: children studying in different classes are exposed to different, sometimes quite opposite, gender differences and this variability is effectively masked by the aggregate-level analyses typically reported in the literature; (3) the lion's share of the variability of the within-class gender gap lies within, rather than between schools; and (4) the relative frequency of within-class gender gaps favouring boys is positively related to school-level characteristics, which qualify as positive indicators of the school's quality and negatively to class size. The within- and between-sector (Arab vs. Jewish) components of this relation are discussed.</str>

    <str name="description">Some of the most male-dominated science, technology, engineering and mathematics occupations and degree programmes are found in the world's most affluent societies. This article assesses whether gender gaps in &amp;quot;attitudes&amp;quot; follow similarly surprising patterns. Multivariate analysis of eighth-graders' affinity for mathematics and aspirations for mathematically related jobs in 53 countries shows that the attitudinal gender gap is indeed larger in affluent &amp;quot;postmaterialist&amp;quot; societies. Moreover, both girls and boys view mathematics more negatively in these societies. The authors suggest that cultural ideals of individual self-expression, highly prevalent under conditions of broad-based existential security, operate to reduce girls' and boys' interest in pursuits thought to be economically practical but personally non-expressive. Girls may be particularly susceptible to this negative effect, because taken-for-granted cultural beliefs about core female personality traits (and girls' gendered understandings of their own authentic inner selves) are often at odds with dominant representations of mathematical and technical work.</str>

      <str>Minello, Alessandra</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper aims to investigate to what extent the growing presence of children with immigrant background in the Italian school system has an impact on the educational expectations of Italian students in eighth grade. Educational expectations are individuals' plans for their future educational career, adjusted to the subjectively estimated probabilities of achieving a given outcome. Multilevel analyses are performed using data from ITAGEN2 (Italian Second Generation) survey, the first nationwide survey on natives, first- and second-generation immigrants. Results demonstrate that attending a school with a high proportion of children of immigrants has no impact on realistic expectations about secondary education. In addition, students attending schools with high level of interethnic integration are more prone to having high educational expectations.</str>

    <str name="description">Recent decades have seen a dramatic expansion in the educational attainment and occupational opportunities of German women. Both the educational and occupational positions of the mothers and those of their daughters are continuously changing across cohorts. Our study aims to detect the probability of daughters to experience maternal-line intergenerational educational and occupational mobility. Using new data from the National Educational Panel Study of adult cohorts, we analyse successive cohorts of German women born between 1944 and 1984. We demonstrate that the relation between mothers' and daughters' educational and occupational career has changed over time. Maternal-line female mobility has decreased over cohorts. Our results also reveal that the relationship between educational careers and female job mobility has changed. The tertiary level of education has become more relevant across cohorts in preventing downward intergenerational mobility and it has become a prerequisite for taking part in the completion for upward intergenerational mobility.</str>

    <str name="description">Schooling is now considered the major factor underlying the development of cognitive abilities. However, most studies on the effect of schooling on cognitive development have been conducted in free and generally supportive western environments. The possible variability of schooling effects between educational systems differing in the quality of schooling they provide or in the ability of the student population to benefit from schooling has been neglected. This work contributes to the study of this variability by estimating the effect of schooling on cognitive development in an educational system characterised by particularly unfavourable circumstances, which combine poor schooling quality and low ability of the student population to benefit from schooling due to economic disadvantage, military occupation, and political oppression: the UN Relief and Works Agency Palestinian refugee camps of the West Bank. The results indicate a lower contribution of schooling to children's cognitive development, both relative to that found in western countries and relative to the effect of age. Schooling is not the major factor underlying children's cognitive development in the refugee camps in the West Bank. These results illustrate the between-system variability of the schooling effects and suggest that poverty and oppression negatively affect the effect of schooling on cognitive development.</str>

    <str name="description">This study attempts to explain a process of inserting global transnational elements into an undergraduate sociology course. After a review of global themes covered in introductory sociology textbooks, the author administered two projects (Global Multiculturalism and Sociology of Wal-Mart) in an undergraduate sociology course. The current study reports the techniques used within these projects called the Multi-Phase Class Activity of Globalisation (MUPCAG) model used in General Sociology classes, student reactions related to them, and the significance of the projects in terms of teaching and learning. The MUPCAG model was to enhance students&amp;apos; understanding of global multiculturalism and interconnectedness, in particular, students&amp;apos; critical thinking about the issues of globalisation. It was observed that students showed more flexible and diverse approaches when exposed to concrete concepts, such as commodity chain, global city and global intersection in class discussion.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Zhao, Zhenzhou</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">With the relaxation of the system of command in China's public schooling sector and the decline of ideological coercion in the post-Mao era, the Chinese state has reshaped its control over individual teachers. Much effort has been made to analyse the state's influence on teachers' academic activities at school, but little attention has been paid to the teacher-state relationship in another facet of teachers' work, namely the socialisation of students. This article examines Chinese teachers' perceptions of their relationship with the state through an analysis of homeroom teachers' perspectives. Using a multi-method approach, this study reveals the teacher-state relationship through three key themes: teacher-profession-state, teacher-school-state, and teacher-market-state. The findings indicate that the post-Mao regime seeks to monitor and control homeroom teachers using indirect, subtle methods, and that teachers have a complicated understanding of the state's articulation of their role and status.</str>

    <str name="description">The paper examines processes of cultural production and reproduction among members of the elite and upper-middle classes. Drawing on findings from a study of private education in England, it explores the utility of a conceptual framework to examine how practices in and across different sites may be reproductive of various forms of &amp;quot;privilege&amp;quot;. Three domains in particular - family, the school and individual young women's projects of the self - together shape key meanings and orientations informing young women's lives. These meanings and orientations in turn connect to &amp;quot;privileging practices&amp;quot;, both within each domain and beyond. The paper analyses data from three young women in one of the schools studied to illustrate how the framework may be used to examine privately educated young women's different orientations to the present and the future. Findings point to some of the processes through which class and gender privilege may be variably reproduced.</str>

    <str name="description">This study considers the extensive critique of the impact of the &amp;quot;market&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;neoliberal&amp;quot; model on learning and its outcomes in the light of alternative models. The purpose is to consider the potential impacts of the market on learning and its outcomes and to contextualise critique by considering alternative coordination regimes. Three alternative regimes to coordinating economic activity and various aspects of education and adult learning systems (market-dominated, state-dominated and stakeholder-dominated) are contrasted by highlighting the weaknesses and strengths of each with regard to learning and its outcomes. In turn, these regimes are linked to the varieties of capitalism and welfare state literature. Comparative data are used to briefly consider the link between alternative regimes and the level and distribution of adult learning.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Rogers, John</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores John Dewey&amp;apos;s Depression-era analysis of &amp;quot;liberalism&amp;quot; in an effort to clarify our own neoliberal moment. As Dewey argues, liberalism is a term used in the 1930s to signify diverse and often contradictory meanings. It variously refers to a minimalist state aimed at unbinding markets (laissez-faire liberalism) or an activist state charged with providing social welfare (what Dewey described as &amp;quot;humane liberalism&amp;quot;). Finding limitations in these visions of liberalism, Dewey calls for a &amp;quot;radical&amp;quot; liberalism that would socialise the economy, challenge the corrupting power of privileged elites, and embrace experimentalism and mass participation in social planning and decision-making. The article draws on Dewey&amp;apos;s analysis of different liberalisms to make sense of contemporary political and educational debates that have been profoundly shaped by the growing prominence of neoliberalism in recent decades. It sheds light on why particular educational issues have emerged as central sites of contest while others receive little or no attention and hints at possibilities for social reconstruction.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Van Heertum, Richard</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Neoliberalism is the dominant economic paradigm in the globe today. It has led to stagnant wages, high unemployment, increased income inequality and a decline in quality of life for the average citizen in the industrialised world over the past 30?years. It has also fomented a dramatic increase in economic instability, culminating in the 2007 financial crisis. In this article, I argue for Neo-Keynesian economic policy, including reregulation of the financial sector, a more progressive tax system and strategic government investment in the economy. Looking at education, I conclude that economic reform is a necessary corollary to educational reform if we are to improve the prospects of the next generation.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Hamilton, Paula</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Current government policy, which calls for closer working relationships with families, together with the escalation of globalised communities places mounting pressure on teachers to take account of increasingly diverse family values, traditions and parenting styles. Considering the disproportionate number of minority ethnic children facing educational underachievement in the UK, one could argue practitioners take up this challenge. In view of increased European migration, this paper considers factors which remain the key to enabling migrant worker parents to establish and sustain effective links with their child's school. After decades of research and government reports, how far we have come to ensuring that &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; families are enabled to become involved in their children's schooling? The findings, which stem from a broader qualitative study, are largely presented through three collective vignettes which represent the voices, and different experiences, encountered by nine migrant worker parents. Factors identified as having significance to home-school relations include language barriers, issues associated with changing family structures, and community relations.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">In the new millennium model of low definition curriculum, teachers have professional latitude to deliver prescribed disciplinary content through a range of pedagogical and assessment orientations. The rhetoric is that with carefully crafted practice, the goal of high quality/high equity learning outcomes can be achieved for all students. This paper is focused on the experiences of teachers and students from one large multicultural, multilingual, low socio-economic status community from Reunion Island, a remote French department in the Indian Ocean. In their history and geography lessons, the topic of study is a contentious one and closely connected to the students' personal histories, that of slavery in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Using an analytical lens that combines the sociological work of Bernstein and Maton, and utilises ranking questionnaires, this study examines the complexity and tensions inherent in teachers' choices and the implications for students' short- and long-term learning outcomes.</str>

    <str name="description">I argue that 2011 witnessed a series of challenges to neoliberalism on a global scale perhaps not seen since the political upheavals of 1968, and that media spectacle provided the form of a series of global insurgences from the North African Arab Uprisings to the Occupy movements. Crises of neoliberalism also generated movements in Italy, Spain, Greece and other European movements that utilised strategies of the Arab Uprisings and provided global media spectacles of popular struggle and insurrection. In fall 2011, Occupy Wall Street adapted these tactics to symbolically attack the citadel of neoliberalism and the Occupy movement provided a democratic response to crises of capitalism and neoliberalism that have resulted in global economic crisis since 2008. The Occupy Wall Street movement in turn generated Occupy movements throughout the world under the slogan of Occupy Everywhere!</str>

    <str name="description">In this article, we use interview data collected in a four-year longitudinal study of first-generation university students to answer the question: how might the ethnicity of first-generation students impact their university experiences? After briefly examining previous literature written on the educational achievement levels of ethnic-minority Canadians, specifically Asian-Canadians, and on first-generation students, we explain the concept of social capital and how it relates to ethnicity. The findings extracted from the interviews in this paper suggest that, although first-generation students lack general knowledge about university, their ethnic identities serve to ease their disadvantaged positions in university by serving as both bonding and bridging social capital in the form of relationships, peer groups and ethnic clubs.</str>

We explored 2009 Program for International Student Assessment results regarding the nature and intensity of extracurricular activities implemented in schools. We used school's questionnaires to conceptualise the relations between schools' contextual variables and extracurricular activities. Descriptive statistics and Poisson regression analyses were applied for data analysis.</str>

    <str name="description">In the course of educational expansion, student populations have become more diverse. This paper represents an international literature review on the topic of first-generation students (FGS), i.e. students whose parents have not obtained a higher education qualification. On the basis of more than 70 research articles and reports on FGS from several countries, we find that the focal points in FGS research concern their pre-college characteristics, mobility factors, decisions about institution, degree and subjects, FGS' experiences at university, and academic outcomes. Summarising the state of research on these topics, we point to two problems: (1) the international incommensurability of data on FGS due to differences in how FGS are defined and researched; (2) the depiction of FGS' problems as individual rather than structural problems. We recommend that structural changes such as making organisational structures in higher education institutions more transparent are in order instead of offering special support programmes only for FGS.</str>

    <str name="description">Cultural Mismatch Theory (CMT) has emerged as a paradigm to account for the disparate experiences and outcomes of first-generation students (FGSs). Past research on CMT demonstrate how social class disposition can shape cultural mismatch among FGSs; however, the sole focus on social class sacrifices attention to other social markers of significance. Our manuscript explores if FGSs at the intersection of marginalized social class and racial/ethnic identities (working-class, Cambodian American students), experience cultural mismatch and how an institutional mechanism (student organizations) addresses that mismatch. We find that through their involvement in a student organization, first-generation, working-class, Cambodian American students foster a community that supports interdependent norms, while simultaneously developing skills to navigate independent norms. These efforts produce cultural match and demonstrate agentic qualities through which students reconfigure moments of cultural mismatch to assert their views of legitimacy and reshape the boundaries of cultural capital.</str>

    <str name="description">This article employs the concept of 'everyday multiculturalism' to examine what students at an elite school in Australia are taught about working with and across difference through global citizenship education within a single-sex classroom model. The authors explore the ways in which larger social cohesion agendas are reinforced through the meanings and practices of global citizenship education to facilitate increased interactions between different groups around a set of shared values and common practices. The authors illustrate how this approach to global citizenship education and the school's single-sex classroom model both maintain racial, ethnic and gendered divisions within the student body. Within this schooling context, students are not provided the kinds of instructional spaces that promote interdependence and habitual engagement necessary for productively working with and across difference.</str>

      <str>Toh, Glenn</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The Japanese community in Singapore comprises mainly white-collar workers and their families. This article addresses issues concerning education, overseas living, and identity-related investments made visible by way of examining schooling and parenting practices. Framed within a critique which recognizes schooling and identity investment as being inherently ideological in nature, the discussion centers around a Japanese school in whose broader operations both parents and other Japanese institutions are involved. Subsequent analysis is directed towards deconstructing (1) institutionalized practices relating to ways in which Japanese overseas organize their lives and frame their life experiences; and (2) the means by which particular notions of Japanese cultural and national heritage are legitimated and fostered through schooling. The article concludes with the observation that the maintenance of an ideologized form of Japaneseness, and not the engenderment of cosmopolitan or globalized identities, constitutes the dominant driving force behind Japanese-medium schooling in Singapore.</str>

    <str name="description">Family involvement has become increasingly recognized as essential to academic success. However, the racial and cultural gap between the teaching force and students in American schools is large and expanding, leading to increased challenges associated with relationship-building between families and schools. This is a study of teachers in a school district in the State of Florida that has high rates of poverty, large numbers of new and undocumented immigrants, and many families who speak languages other than English at home. Using a Bourdieusian theoretical framework, this study investigates teachers' recognition of their own habitus and that of families and of the doxa within the field of the school. This study asks the teachers, by their own accounts, what prevents them from greater success in developing and sustaining culturally sustaining family-school partnerships.</str>

    <str name="description">Latin families moving to a different Latin American country are placed in a dominated position by what is called 'coloniality'. In this sense, we argue that the processes of classification (in terms of social class), racialisation and genderisation that migrant Latin families experience when choosing schools for their children in the Chilean context can be a form of this coloniality. To make our case, we use narratives from in-depth interviews conducted in Valparaíso with migrant families who applied to schools under the new admission system. In this sense, narratives show that the processes of classification, racialisation and genderisation, as socio-cultural productions, intersect with migrant families' school-choice experiences. These intersections emerge when families match school choices with an shelter search, as they manifest their interests to protect their children, avoiding schools with 'marginal children' or racial bullying and safeguarding gender expectations.</str>

    <str name="description">The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between a school's design and architecture and its educational practices, in light of critical theories regarding place, space and education. The study was based on 63 observations during the school daily activities and 75 semi-structured interviews with students, teachers and other staff, as well as two focus-groups consisting of school graduates. We identified two major elements that are shared by the school's physical-architectural and pedagogical infrastructure: fluidity and synoptical practices of visibility, that construct two principles of a subversive structure, benevolent and therapeutic control, and detouring practices of power relations and the creation of emancipating spaces. The article proposes a conceptual framework to illuminate the findings and discusses theoretical and practical implementations that are essential for future policies regarding educational practices for youth at risk for dropout.</str>

    <str name="description">Many elite schools proclaim a commitment to racial and other aspects of student diversity and inclusion. Pursuing this commitment is highly complex and contentious given the traditions of exclusion elite schools are founded upon. This paper examines some of these contentions drawing on research conducted at Cherry Tree Academy, an elite pre-K-12 school situated in the USA. Interviews and observations with faculty and students revealed contentions related to race at the school. Diversity efforts were considered synonymous with addressing the needs of Black students and produced expressions of apathy and victimhood from majority White students. Such racial contentions are examined in relation to the concepts of meritocracy and social justice. Examining these contentions remains significant in light of the renewed commitment to diversity and inclusion in elite schools and the reality that elite students are likely to be tomorrows' decision makers with the power to create more equitable societies.</str>

    <str name="description">Research on homework, particularly using qualitative approaches, is neglected in sociological literature. This qualitative study uses a Bourdieusian interpretive lens to explore parental homework practices in a middle-class, urban setting in Ireland. In-depth semi-structured interviews were held with six parents and six teachers of pupils aged 10-11 years. We found that parents' homework practices involved providing practical, educational, and emotional supports for their children. Homework offers a valuable analytic site wherein particularities of habitus, field, and capitals are revealed. Middle-class parents possess the requisite capitals to succeed in meeting schools' expectations; they align their practices closely with those of the school, successfully replicating the field of the school; and they activate economic, cultural, and social capital on behalf of their children, such that the presence and use of many capitals are normalised in the familial quotidien, thereby privileging their children, and making visible micro-processes of social reproduction.</str>

    <str name="description">The focus of this paper is to investigate what type of support high-achieving Swedish upper secondary students from families with low socioeconomic and educational capital, identified contributed to embark on a successful educational career. The analytical framework of the study is concepts that have emerged in empirical studies inspired by both Coleman's and Bourdieu's understanding of social capital concerning educational performance. The data analysed in this study are interviews with 23 students between 17 and 19 years old, 10 male and 13 female students. A substantial group of the students in this study is of migrant background. The support these students identified as critical in their successful educational experience was a combination of academic and emotional support by the teachers, a caring home environment and unconditional emotional support, and socialising with peers that had similar educational ambitions. When all these support dimensions line up for these students, they can embark on a successful educational career.</str>

    <str name="description">In this article, we examine conceptualisations of luck evoked by a select group of elite students studying in Oxbridge, when accounting for their academic success. The emphasis on luck in their narratives is categorised into three themes. The students linked their luckiness to deservedness, used luck as a way to express humbleness, and attributed their success to factors of chance. These themes are analysed against the backdrop of strong institutional support they receive as part of attending elite schools and being scholarship recipients. By being attentive to how luck is evoked in these narratives, we show that luck does not have an essential meaning and can produce different representations of legitimacy. The paper proposes the integration between critical and pragmatic sociological perspectives in order to advance our understandings of how elite groups qualify for the positions they obtain, how they define themselves and make sense of their educational merits.</str>

    <str name="description">This article discusses the possible effect that schools can have on students, beyond the socioeconomic factors traditionally researched by the Sociology of Education. Within this context, curriculum production can be included as a cross-cutting theme to these studies, within the scope of school effectiveness, once it interferes in the political and social construction of civic engagement of its citizens. The discussion argues the principle of Global Citizenship Education (GCE) can be taught through the school discipline of Sociology, through the concept of environmental justice. In this sense, the purpose of this article is to associate the learning of environmental justice with the increasing of civic engagement. The analysis of a sociology textbook leads to the conclusion that the curriculum of environmental justice can positively impact the increase of global citizenship and social transformation, and above all, the consolidation of a democratic culture.</str>

    <str name="description">This study examines young children's understanding of environmental issues in Malta. Informed by a socio-cultural perspective and adopting a qualitative methodology, this case study was conducted with 10 children (ages 3-7). The data were obtained through children's interpretation of photographs depicting environmental issues. The results showed that young children possess some understanding of environmental issues and they could talk about them, indicating that environmental understanding starts in early childhood. Some children also held misconceptions about environmental issues. In light of these findings, it can be argued that starting environmental learning in early childhood is important for the achievement of a sustainable future.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">What education should children and youth be offered about climate mitigation choices? Drawing on critical pedagogy, political ecology, and environmental justice, I here suggest the elaboration of a critical climate education that would provide citizens with knowledge and skills to respond to the climate crisis with responsible action. I argue that students need to learn to critically examine options in their own countries for reducing greenhouse emissions and to discuss whether or not each of these measures may contribute to climate justice in time and space. A critical climate education should also offer insight into reasons why some climate mitigation alternatives have been embraced instead of options that could provide more climate justice in time and space. The need for a critical climate education is illustrated with a case study about climate mitigation choices that have been made in Norway without concern for climate justice.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Griffiths, Tom G.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a significant marker in global efforts to universalise a conception of ecologically sustainable human development. SDG 4's expanded vision of quality education for all extends to the Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) Agenda's call for education that contributes to all of SDGs, and prepares students to 'transform our world'. From a critical perspective, this paper considers the incompatibility of endless (compound) economic growth and capital accumulation, under capitalism, with the required CO2 reductions that the climate emergency demands. The paper shows how the ESD proposals reflect the orthodoxy of education as human capital formation for economic development, albeit within a reformed 'green growth' model. At the same time, it argues that their distinctive ambitions and transformational language provide space for critical educators to simultaneously work with and against their contradictions and limitations, and to advance non-capitalist and degrowth alternatives.</str>

It then highlights the perspectives of several young climate activists, before considering a range of factors ('elephants in the room') that lurk behind the incapacity of our current practices to create spaces that provide opportunities for full expression of young people, particularly Indigenous young people, to articulate their political analyses and collectively advocate for ways of being in the world that will honour their values and aspirations.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper describes a conceptual extension of the socialization process and its implications for education. The motivation to the coining of ecosocialization comes from a recent turn in different branches of science, which forces us to problematize the anthropocentric view of life. The theoretical analysis combines the frameworks of phenomenology and ecology. Phenomenology emphasizes perception and experience to remind us that we exist in the world through our bodies, while ecology examines interactions between different life forms in ecological communities. Parallel to the human-human and human-society interactions, we are ecosocialized by human-other beings and human-ecosystem interactions. These latter interactions also make us what we are, even before any intentional education efforts. Although socialization and ecosocialization are parallel processes, they are unfolded and driven by different mechanisms. The conceptualization of ecososialization is argued to play an important role in addressing the ecorisis in an educational context, both in research and practice.</str>

    <str name="description">This article focuses on the relationships between social justice, environmental justice, and sustainability from the local to global levels. We envision social and environmental justice as involving not only human beings, but also the rights of all species to life and respect. We advocate an ecological justice approach based on the equality and intrinsic value of all existence. This standpoint also forefronts core values and world views of marginalized people and epistemologies, such as Indigenous knowledge systems. With the understanding that there is much heterogeneity among Indigenous communities and individuals, we delve into core commonalities which embrace the perspective that humanity's relation to the cosmos is ever-salient, that the Earth is a living being, and all species, as interconnected co-habitants of Earth, are intelligent, equal, and divine.</str>

    <str name="description">Climate change impacts cascade across scales and sectors, and present specific threats to education institutions and systems, including reduced educational access, participation and attainment by students. In this paper, we set out the pursuit of climate change mitigation and adaptation responses, grounded in commitments to equity and justice, as a renewed fundamental purpose for higher education. To this end, we suggest the understanding of public and private benefits of education that is typically applied to individuals may be usefully applied at institution and system scale. However, in the context of an accelerating climate crisis, adopting a renewed fundamental purpose will require institutions and systems to display critical awareness beyond the public-private benefits divide, towards an understanding of themselves as embedded in -- rather than separate to -- their broader communities and societies, and an acknowledgement of the particular interests that are foregrounded and privileged in the construction of their purpose.</str>

    <str name="description">This article analyzes students' perspectives on sustainable development, environmental justice, and concomitant environmental education programs at two international schools in Singapore. Data include surveys of over 250 students and 19 focus-group interviews with 300 students. In addition to having a detailed and nuanced understanding of the complexity of climate change and its impacts, most students acknowledged both the likely consequences of continuing resource-intensive industrialization and the growing and unjust disparity in carbon emissions between developed and developing countries. Many students also recognized that contemporary lifestyles rooted in overconsumption are not sustainable and proposed a variety of measures -- both mainstream (i.e., discourage meat consumption and single-use plastic) and radical (population-control measures) -- to curb consumption. While identifying some areas for improvement in their schools' commitment to sustainability issues, students overall valued the ecological education that their schools provided them and to various extents recognized the privileges it has afforded them.</str>

    <str name="description">Today humanity is facing a sixth mass extinction: the first in 65 million years. The extinction underway is occurring at a rate faster than any previous mass extinction in Earth's history. Our current forms of extraction economics, overproduction, and consumption are not just unsustainable -- they are literally annihilationist towards our biosphere. They endanger the very fabric of life in our planet. Yet to imagine a redesign is nearly impossible for many who currently benefit from such systems. Where does the knowledge and critical consciousness for how to reimagine new systems of living reside? Two questions guide our research: (1) Can education play a role in redesigning such systems?; and (2) How do resistance movements and their associated forms of education help us reconsider the imaginaries of what is possible? Specifically, we explore the ways in which activist has evolved into a form of education, particularly through its engagement in non-formal education.</str>

    <str name="title">The Elite Nature of International Schooling: A Theoretical Framework Based upon Rituals and Character Formation</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Bunnell, Tristan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The well-established yet under-theorised body of 'Traditional International Schools' warrant much greater sociological analysis and inquiry as 'elite' educational institutions. This paper uses Basil Bernstein's &amp;quot;Sociology of the School&amp;quot; to discuss the 'expressive culture' of such schools, representing an idealised model of conduct, character and manner. The role of rituals in transmitting this culture is discussed by applying Randall Collins' Interaction &amp;quot;Ritual Chain Theory&amp;quot; showing how every-day festivals and fundraising events (commonly conceptualised as forming the 'Five Fs') can help build up positive emotional energy, which can be used to facilitate action, and embed the expressive culture. Maurice Halbwachs' concept of &amp;quot;Collective Memory&amp;quot; is then used to show how interaction rituals can deliver a permanent group recollection, essential for enduring class solidarity and cohesion. Overall, an introductory and coherent theoretical framework for identifying a &amp;quot;Sociology of International Schooling&amp;quot; is presented, focusing on what aspects of the schooling experience makmakes it an attractive and elite, privileged one.</str>

    <str name="description">We seek to consider the use of Pierre Bourdieu's 'cultural capital' within Swedish sociology of education focusing on the adoption of the term and asking how the 'cultural capital' is related to the specific context in Sweden. Here we consider the historical context and disciplinary route through which the concept travelled. The Swedish educational system promoted the ideal of meritocracy: everyone had an equal chance to access education, which in turn should facilitate social mobility. Even if the economic barriers to accessing education had been removed and higher education was available, social equality had not been achieved. The concept of cultural capital allowed for precise analyses of social groups' use of the education system. The studies were able to show that the meritocratic ideal also concealed an inequality, where the school's embrace of culture was something different from, and more than, what the teaching was supposed to convey.</str>

    <str name="description">This article attempts to bridge a divide between the empirical use of Bourdieu's concepts and the theoretical discussion of field theory with regard to education. I ask how a school can be 'international' where education is predominantly embedded in nation-states. First, I introduce field theory and its applications to globalization and education. Second, I analyze the International Baccalaureate Organization, a large non-profit provider of accreditation for schools, as a case for conceptualizing a global field of 'international education.' My ethnographic and historical findings provide the background for the global field argument. Second, drawing on IBO's student data, I construct a geometric space of IB schools and analyze it as a relatively autonomous subfield. Finally, I show how combining field analysis and geometric modeling yields a new perspective on 'international education.'</str>

    <str name="description">This paper offers an ethnographic account of how Golden Harvest International School in Bengaluru branded itself as both 'International' and 'Indian', by elaborating discursive practices within the school. Drawing upon scholarship that has sought to delineate the ways in which globally hyper-mobile Indians construct a distinctive cultural identity, the paper shows how a fusion of national and international allowed the school to cater to a particular set of elite parents, who were globally hyper-mobile even as they sought to be 'appropriately Indian'. The paper pays attention to how cultural practices and resources in the school operated within a forward caste-Hindu ethos that was presented as 'Indian', while also responsibilising teachers, students, and even parents to ensure the school acquired and retained globally valued credentials such as accreditation for the Middle Years Program of the International Baccalaureate.</str>

    <str name="description">Global citizenship education has been in the world agenda for some time. However, different understandings of global citizenship are at play not only on the official curricula but also in the daily enactments of students within each institution. The research presented in this article seeks to investigate the notions of citizenship practices in an elite secondary school in Bogota, Colombia's capital city. Following Andreotti,, I argue that this particular school educates under the light of a soft global citizenship that reproduces the country's status quo and its inequalities. Empirical data were collected through classroom observations, interviews and group interviews.</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores the academic trajectories of transnational postgraduates. We draw upon interrelated theories of globalization and transnational social fields to frame the globalizing social and educational contexts in which international students navigate their lives and careers after earning doctoral degrees. We draw on in-depth interviews where transnational postgraduates' voices are placed at the center of the findings, and we explore how their background, journey, and environment simultaneously shaped them as well as transformed the spaces they inhabited. We highlight how the movement of transnational postgraduates is not simply a transfer from one physical location to another, but rather that the movement itself constitutes and structures a new space of identification and of belonging and global imagination.</str>

    <str name="description">Ecopedagogy has become central in transforming environmental pedagogies. Nevertheless, its full potential has not been realised especially in developing countries. This study investigated the extent to which a course taught in one university in Tanzania reflects the tenets of ecopedagogy. Based on seven-years experience in teaching the course, analysis of the course curriculum and on lessons from recent efforts to teach the course using ecopedagogy, I find the course more consistent with ecopedagogy in the aspects focusing on indigenous knowledge, learning from different perspectives and democratisation of learning. However, the course is less consistent with ecopedagogy in the aspects of critical analysis of environmental discourses and globalisation. Moreover, I report on the contradictions arising from teaching using a highly centralised curriculum, on one hand, and using approaches that emphasise on critical co-construction of knowledge on the other hand. Finally, the implications for theory and practice are discussed.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Aside from a student's personal desire to pursue higher education, a culture of high expectations in a school can have important consequences on the individual's achievement. However, the school's 'collective expectation' is affected by many contextual factors like urbanicity. Contributing to the research on urban-rural difference in education and nuancing the importance of having a culture of high expectations, this research examines how collective expectations affect student achievement differently in urban and rural schools. Using hierarchical linear models of a longitudinal sample of US high school students, the research shows how collective expectations have significant influence on short- and long-term outcomes of urban school students, but no significant ones on rural school students. It suggests the importance of shared expectations in urban schools, and how expectations -- both individual and collective -- can be leveraged to help students.</str>

    <str name="description">Drawing on the data provided by Russian panel study 'Trajectories in Education and Careers' (TrEC), we explore the different rationales pupils employ in deciding their education path in grade nine. Drawing on the relative risk aversion theory we show how young people's decision-making logics are aimed at class maintenance and risk management. Using a qualitative methodology we show that the decision to continue into grade ten with the view to enter a university program is largely a 'non-decision' informed by class-appropriate ambition. While students from higher socio-economic backgrounds 'automatically' enrol in grade ten, students of lower socio-economic backgrounds tend to opt for vocational education in the hope of 'fast-tracking' to adulthood and the world of work. Drawing on the concept of a 'cultural narrative' we also demonstrate that what is considered 'rational,' 'safe', 'risky,' etc. is both class- and culture-specific.</str>

    <str name="description">The field of memory studies tends to focus attention on the '3Ms' -- museums, monuments, memorials -- as sites where memories are constructed, communicated, and contested. Where education is identified as a site for memory, the focus is often narrowly on what is or is not communicated within curricula or textbooks, assuming that schools simply pass on messages agreed or struggled over elsewhere. This article explores the possibilities opened when educative processes are not taken as stable and authoritative sites for transmitting historical narratives, but instead as spaces of contestation, negotiation and cultural production. With a focus on 'difficult histories' of recent conflict and historical injustice, we develop a research agenda for education as a site of memory and show how this can illuminate struggles over dominant historical narratives at various scales, highlighting agencies that educational actors bring to making sense of the past.</str>

    <str name="description">This study utilizes a critical phenomenological approach and adopts concepts of linguistic hegemony and linguistic capital, to explore the life course stages of former Korean college student-athletes who dropped out of athletic programs and who faced vocational challenge but obtained successful careers in their ideal career fields through improving their English proficiency. The three primary scholarly themes include: (a) typical English level and vocational challenges due to the lack of English proficiency; (b) the journey to gain English proficiency; and (c) English proficiency as a vehicle for entering desired career fields. Although this study identified the ways in which participants found avenues through gaining linguistic capital, linguistic hegemony is deeply ingrained into the Korean social structures and into their education systems, society, and culture. Therefore, this study critiques these ongoing structural problems to promote positive social change in the future.</str>

    <str name="description">While literature documents how the employability agenda has become the new neoliberal common sense in universities much less attention has been given to the mechanisms of adaptation by students. Utilizing a four-year longitudinal case study of scholarship students at an elite university, this paper focuses on the process through which this 'meritocratic' program normalises neoliberal common sense in higher education. We put into question the principle of positive discrimination, considering the limited number of beneficiaries. Our findings illustrate that, instead of minimizing inequalities, this scholarship program contributes in strengthening the neoliberal ideology within the education system. We further demonstrate that students' backgrounds influence their adaptation into the program and access to employment. In addition, we argue that urban-rural differences among others have more explanatory power than class differences in understanding the complex adaptation of students into the program in the Lebanese context.</str>

    <str name="description">Over the past decade the Teach for India (TFI) organisation has emerged as a prominent non-governmental organisation (NGO) involved in Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) with ailing urban municipal government bodies across select cities in India. An off-shoot of the Teach for America (TFA) programme, TFI aims to improve quality of education in under-resourced municipal government schools through English medium education. Through in-depth interviews with members associated with TFI, some municipal school teachers and information accessed through Right to Information (RTI) applications, this article delineates the modalities of the PPP arrangement within municipal schools in Delhi. It examines how the intervention is institutionalising parallel governance structures, accentuating class-based tensions and exacerbating pedagogical inequities within these long-neglected schools.</str>

    <str name="description">Contemporary global flows of people, ideas and capital have led to profound changes in transnational interactions, affinities, forms of sociality and understandings of citizenship. Traditional vocabularies of citizenship struggle to cope with this rescaling of dimensions of citizenship in an increasingly globalised world. In addition, educational policies and practices remain primarily focused on normative, national conceptions of citizens, thus overlooking the multiple, diverse and plural conceptualisations of diverse young citizens in classrooms today. Arguing for a fresh approach that applies 'cosmopolitan sociologies' of education, in this paper, we propose a framework for understanding citizenship that centres on spatial, relational and affective dimensions of citizenship. We review recent research with young people highlighting the multiple ways in which young people are constituted as citizens through a range of social, affective and spatial affinities. The paper concludes by examining the implications of this framework for educational policies and practices.</str>

      <str>Doherty, Catherine</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper reviews sociological literature to explore the challenge transnational populations pose for nation-based curriculum, and vice versa. With increasing access to dual citizenship and temporary migration, more people are living transnational lifestyles. This poses new challenges in raising the transnational child. Transnationalism has emerged 'bottom-up' from individualised choices and circumstances rather than 'top-down' through institutional strategy. As a result, education sectors are yet to respond with a reoriented curriculum that can accommodate polycentric lives. This paper adapts Beck's critique of methodological nationalism and proposes a parallel concept in the curricular nationalism underpinning much official curriculum. It then reviews literature reporting on three curricular experiments that seek to cultivate citizenships above and beyond the nation. While such transcendent designs on citizenship unsettle curricular nationalism, they fail to address the specificities of transnational child's memberships both here and there. The pedagogic principle of 'connectedness' is retooled as a pragmatic way forward.</str>

    <str name="description">For some scholars and commentators, the era of globalisation represented a new border-less age. However, the continuing legacy of colonial expansion through contemporary forms of imperialism and mass movement of migrants and refugees, has ensured that, in today's globalised world, the relevance of the border is growing, not declining. Indeed, the question of the border seems more urgent than ever. It is this urgency that has driven us to pause, here, on the idea and problem of 'the border'. We argue that borders are a 'fact' of social life and that the border represents the social and material manifestation of the political and ethical problems of the relationship between the universal and the particular. This relationship is an irresolvable but necessary tension for the pursuit of justice, which we suggest sociological and education work must confront and attend to.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper contributes to the understanding of how shifting time, space and subject positions can impact on the political habitus of border-crossing students. Employing in-depth interview data from a longitudinal project involving 31 mainland Chinese students whose higher education journeys converged in Hong Kong, it argues that it is often unintended outcomes such as the development of a political habitus that can have lasting effects on students' longer term life trajectories. This paper's systematic exposition of these students' political habitus formation redresses Bourdieu's relative neglect of the shaping of the political habitus of 'non-professional' political agents, in contrast to his emphasis on that of the 'professionals', such as politicians. This paper also moves beyond existing literature's focus on social agents' experiences in static and unified political fields at specific times by foregrounding the experiences of these mainland Chinese students moving across conflictual political fields over time.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper explores the learning experiences and literacy practices of a group of female migrant domestic workers from Nepal, reporting on ethnographic data collected between 2008 and 2013. Drawing on the conceptualisation of literacy as a social practice, as well as the notion of translocational positionality, it examines the way in which the women's emerging literacy practices in English interacted with their experiences as migrant workers. It argues that understanding the transnational nature of the women's lives is essential to understanding the complex ways in which literacy was threaded through their social and material practices. In doing so it points to the need for a more complex conceptualisation of context and of the relationship between the local and global within literacy research, which pays attention to the way in which literacy practices interact with processes entailing movement and positioning across boundaries and between different transnational spaces.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines experiences of labour market exploitation and precarity amongst migrating young adults in Canada. It analyses a specific case of hyper-exploitation and wage theft as experienced by a group of refugee young adults. Utilizing feminist materialist conceptions of knowledge and learning, this analysis seeks to move beyond an individualized conception of learning and experience by illuminating the inter-constitutive relations of social experiences. This paper seeks to demonstrate how attending to the social organization of migratory experiences allows for ruptures of individualized conceptions of self and society. Further, the case serves to demonstrate the complexity of experiences that influences the 'learning' associated with migration for refugee young adults.</str>

    <str name="description">Immigration policy in the UK restricts migrants' eligibility to some services and benefits, including in the sphere of education. Compulsory education is available to all, but many migrants face restrictions based on residency and immigration status, which affect fee rates and entitlement to financial support for further and higher education. The article draws on two studies of (i) family migrants and (ii) young precarious migrants to explore how both groups experience bordering in education. We expose how immigration status operates as a category to produce inequalities in educational opportunities. In particular, we show how it intersects with gender and life course, becoming significant unexpectedly at particular moments in time and impacting on migrants' structural and affective integration. In light of this evidence, the article considers the logics behind the funding restrictions, questioning their counterproductive nature for those who are long-term resident and/or likely to remain in the UK.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Dyer, Caroline</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper extends and enriches debates on migration, borders and education by conceptualising education inclusion as a border regime. It applies a regime analysis to illustrate the borders of education inclusion for a community that migration studies have hitherto neglected: mobile pastoralists. It argues that education inclusion signifies a new form of social belonging and border crossing that many mobile pastoralists are undertaking, often precipitated by dispossession from their traditional, mobile livelihood. Supported by empirical data from Ethiopia's Afar region, the regime analysis reveals how educational opportunity for these learners is regulated by border 'checkpoints'. It identifies persisting and emerging inequalities of opportunity under current regimes of education inclusion that challenge the Sustainable Development Goal pledges to reach the last first. A re-appraisal of scholarly boundaries is called for to support the interdisciplinary effort needed to place mobile pastoralists among those who count first.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">In recent decades, many countries began integrating global citizenship education (GCE) into their curricula, both in response to the needs of a diversified pupil body formed by global migrations flows and as a means to prepare pupils to compete and engage in modern globalized society. Frequently, this integration takes place alongside an increasing emphasis on local/national and nationalistic values within schools and education systems. The present study examines the way GCE is articulated and manifested at a school catering to a super-diverse population in inner London. I assess how school life is shaped in accordance to the global/local nexus, specifically identifying the tensions between diverse global and local aspects of the perception of citizenship as they are molded at this school. I reveal the exclusionary form of GCE that is being promoted through schooling in this specific context and the hegemonic nature of the global/local nexus.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper reflects on racial identification in Brazil, considering how concepts of race travel internationally and are transformed locally. In light of the silencing of issues of race in Brazilian public education, we analyse the experiences of student teachers of colour participating in a professional development project coordinated by the authors. We report findings of a qualitative study arising from the project, based on reflective journals and interviews, and focusing on processes of racial resignification and resistance. The narratives produced by participants are situated in relation to dominant discourses of racial democracy and mixing, which deny the possibility of a politicised Afro-Brazilian identity. We show how hybrid identifications, drawing on cultural resources and networks that involve transnational circulation, are part of the construction of new social identities in the context of teacher education.</str>

    <str name="description">The settlement in Australia of people fleeing from war and persecution is claimed as proof of its humanitarian credentials. Australia's identity as a settler colony draws attention to a darker history, featuring colonial practices that remain in the background of educational debates. The paper begins with two examples of harsh and punitive punishment, endorsed electorally and mobilised to manage the racial other. This background sets the context for understanding the cultural politics of besiegement and its implications for schooling. We explore how teachers might be freed up from existing discourses of power and knowledge, by examining their ethical conduct ('care of the self'). Using findings from two Australian studies conducted in the cities of Brisbane and Greater Western Sydney, we explore possibilities for developing alternative political subjectivities for teachers and pre-service teachers. It is through careful attention to their ethical sensibilities that teachers will be empowered to steer education towards a different ontological politics.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Hayes, Aneta</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper contributes to an understanding of the ways in which not being bound to the nation of education, in legal and cultural terms, excludes international students. Based on narrative interviews with 20 students from 6 countries, the paper considers a range of difficulties international students encounter in social and educational domains in which they are interacting and, utilising the conceptual framework of 'nation-boundedness', explains these difficulties. The analysis offers new insights in terms of the role of emotions that were seen in the research to be a new discursive practice, prompting international students to marginalise their rights and voices and not to exercise rights that could protect them from discrimination and racism. The paper concludes that by considering emotions alongside regulatory structures that are established for international students in the receiving countries, a more complex understanding of the ways in which lack of 'nation-boundedness' excludes can be developed.</str>

    <str name="description">In this article, the reviewers, Lee-Tat Chow and Peidong Yang compare and contrast &amp;quot;Desiring TESOL and international education,&amp;quot; by Raqib Chowdhury and Phan Le-Ha, London, Multilingual Matters, 2014, 288 pp., £29.95 (paperback) ISBN 978-1-783-09147-8 with &amp;quot;Transnational education crossing 'Asia' and 'the West',&amp;quot; by Phan LeHa, New York, Routledge, 2017, 260 pp., £36.99 (paperback), ISBN 978-1-138- 60460-5. Chow and Yang assert &amp;quot;Desiring TESOL and International Education&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Transnational Education Crossing 'Asia' and 'the West'&amp;quot; are two important works that mark significant advances in scholarly understandings of desire within the context of international education (henceforth also including its correlate, transnational education). Grounded in rich empirical research, both accounts show how particular constructions of desire and desiring subjects, framed within an 'East' (or 'Asia')-'West' dichotomy, are indispensable for sustaining contemporary trends and developments in international education. Specifically, both works explore how understandings of international education, and the image(s) of the international student, are constructed and perpetuated through discourses; as well as the experiences of international students as they adopt, resist or appropriate these discourses. &amp;quot;Desiring TESOL&amp;quot; primarily explores these issues in the Australian context of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) education, whereas &amp;quot;Transnational Education&amp;quot; addresses a similar set of questions through the case of transnational education (TNE) programmes emerging recently in Asia. Chow and Yang look at each work in turn.</str>

    <str name="title">Decolonizing Education, a View from Palestine: An Interview with Munir Fasheh</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Sukarieh, Mayssoun</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Munir Fasheh is one of the best known Palestinian learning theorists and practitioners, who taught mathematics and physics at Birzeit University in Palestine. Based in Ramallah, Fasheh founded the Tamer Institute for Community Education during the first Intifada as a centre for developing learning environments outside of schooling in Palestine. He also founded the Arab Education Forum (AEF) at Harvard University's Center for Middle Eastern Studies in 1997 and directed it for ten years: the AEF 'attempts to develop a shared vision related to learning in the Arab world . . . that springs out of authentic initiatives which start with and build on what people do and what culture has.' Fasheh is committed to building an understanding and practice of community learning that is tied to living in harmony with wisdom. As such, he works as part of an active network of theorists and practitioners that spans the global South, from India to South Africa to Mexico. Fasheh has continued to focus on the learning and use of maths in community contexts. In this interview, Fasheh responds to questions posed to him by Mayssoun Sukarieh. Among others, the interview covers the following topic areas: How Fasheh's work has been shaped by Indigenous, Arab educational traditions; the importance of the core concepts, such as &amp;quot;mujawara,&amp;quot; that guide Fasheh's education work; how Fasheh practices deschooling in his own work in Palestine; and Fasheh's intellectual journey from being a university professor of mathematics to the community learning work that he does now.</str>

    <str name="title">Teachers and Teacher Education: A Call for A Renewed Sociological Research Agenda</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Reimer, David</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article provides an overview of the main sociological approaches applicable to the study and analysis of teaching, teachers and teacher education. Analytical perspectives from sociology are then compared to research on teachers from two other disciplines, education economics and educational psychology, which have produced the lion's share of recent research on teachers. In the article's final section, recent results are reported from surveys of student teachers and teachers in two Nordic countries, Denmark and Finland, to exemplify the importance of institutional and other contextual variables for the study of teachers and teaching. The article ends with a plea for a renewed sociological research agenda that studies teachers and teacher education.</str>

    <str name="title">A Systematic Form of Japanization in Okinawa: Japanese Identity Construction through a Japanization Discourse in Textbooks and a Textbook Guide</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Taira, Kazufumi</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This research examines some modes of Japanization through education in Okinawa where Japanese influences on education have permeated after Japan's annexation. I investigate how a book excerpt entitled &amp;quot;Mizu no Tozai,&amp;quot; included in high school textbooks in Okinawa, constructs Japanese identity. &amp;quot;Mizu no Tozai&amp;quot; functions as nihonjinron discourse, which is characterized by 'Japanese culture,' 'Japanese uniqueness,' and 'Japaneseness.' The 'East-West' dichotomy, depicted in this &amp;quot;nihonjinron&amp;quot; discourse, induces students to choose 'Japan'/'Japanese culture' and become 'Japanese.' Practice sections of &amp;quot;Mizu no Tozai&amp;quot; in textbooks as well as a textbook guide operate to be complicit in this Japanese identity construction. Through a critical analysis of discourse, I reveal that the &amp;quot;nihonjinron&amp;quot; discourse operating as official knowledge, in collusion with the other discursive texts, produces a position subjected to the discourse of Japanization within which Okinawans become 'Japanese.' I problematize these discursive texts as a systematic form of Japanizing Okinawans' minds through education.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Wilburn, Shelly</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This study qualitatively explores expertise as a critical resource on which quality teaching depends. The study sample is comprised of six South African schools from the poorest poverty quintiles achieving relatively higher and lower academic outcomes. From interview data gathered over three years with teachers and other school staff, findings reveal significant differences between schools in the kinds of expertise that circulate in teacher communities. Remediation strategies that support student learning at specific levels of complexity stand out as a significant form of expertise. In schools performing above demographic expectations, teachers have more opportunities to access knowledge as an instructional resource, enabled by the recognition of differences in expertise. The study offers insight into what kinds of pedagogic strategies might disrupt educational inequalities and support the quality of teaching and learning within a system of scarce resources.</str>

    <str name="description">In this article, we investigate how the shift towards inclusive education in Danish schools changes and affects the ways in which educational-psychological advisory service (in Danish, PPR) units and school staff collaborate. Since inclusion is generally a matter of ensuring that every child can be accommodated within the mainstream school system, the increased inclusion agenda has altered the type of support that PPRs typically offer. Classic psychological assessments now play a lesser role, with PPR staff expected to conduct consultative work to promote the school staff's reflection on their own practice, with the aim of supporting the inclusion of children. Based on an ethnographic study of the collaboration between PPR and school staff, we investigate the impact of the changes on the forms of knowledge and professional subjectivities that are produced, as well as the emotional work that is involved.</str>

    <str name="title">Culturally Responsive Peacebuilding Pedagogy: A Case Study of Fambul Tok Peace Clubs in Conflict-Affected Sierre Leone</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Higgins, Sean</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Recent research on the peace-promoting agency of teachers in conflict-affected contexts has critiqued the dominance of a menu of curriculum initiatives circulated within aid organizations which ignore or dismiss indigenous cultural resources available within local communities. On the other hand, the turn to local culture in peacebuilding interventions has also been critiqued for idealizing the local. This paper presents a case study of the work of Fambul Tok Peace Clubs in conflict-affected Sierra Leone which aim to support teachers in drawing on local practices, rituals and symbols. Using an interpretative approach, alert to the meanings teachers ascribe to their pedagogical practices, it finds that teachers respond to local culture in multiple, sometimes contradictory ways. These range from celebration of indigenous practices as resources for conflict resolution that resonate with their pupils and communities to critique of their oppressive gender norms and inability to address structural drivers of conflict.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lewis, Steven</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) PISA for Schools, a local variant of the more-renowned 'main PISA' test that measures and compares individual school performance on reading, mathematics and science against international schooling systems. Here, I address the governance implications of how PISA for Schools data has been taken up by the transnational European Schools System (ESS). Drawing suggestively across new 'relational' thinking around data-driven modes of governance, as well as interviews with key policy actors within the ESS, I show how PISA for Schools reflects contradictory logics within the ESS, in which the inherently context-based goal of 'becoming European' is juxtaposed with the desire to employ decontextualised international evidence. I conclude by exploring how the perceived need for such data, associated with the global authority of the OECD, can produce a problematic focus on data-driven practices.</str>

    <str name="description">The EU has embraced the use of indicators as policy instruments for achieving common aims. One of the indicators, 'early school leaver' (ESL), depicts the proportion of young people leaving education and training prematurely. Initially defined as an education policy indicator, it has been transformed into a performance indicator measuring the targets of the current Europe 2020 strategy. In this article, we examine how the indicator works as &amp;quot;a policy instrument&amp;quot; at different levels of governance applying the conceptual tools provided by the policy instrumentation approach to unpack the components, pinpoint the political effects, and reveal the power relations they produce. Thus challenging the taken-for-grantedness of comparison as a way of knowing we have intended to shift the focus of discussion concerning the role of large-scale comparisons in education towards more productive directions: moving from problematisation and deconstruction of comparison to engaging with processes of measurement.</str>

      <str>Candido, Helena Hinke Dobrochinski</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper investigates datafication in schools through an analysis of the enactments of quality assurance and evaluation (QAE) policies in Brazil. In doing so, I question how data permeates and changes school environments, school actors' conduct and their imaginaries. QAE policies encompass large-scale assessments, indicators, rankings and other steering mechanisms, but importantly connect data to quality in education. Here, I analyse the discourses of school actors (principals, coordinators, supervisors, teachers, students and parents) from three Brazilian public schools collected through semi-structured interviews (n = 28). Data manifests in those schools as a technology of government. Schools enact QAE policies in distinct ways, incorporating the idea of governmentality, but also proposing alternative patterns of action.</str>

    <str name="description">The process of quantification is a powerful development shaping many domains of life today. In the area of education, for example, performance measurement, testing and ranking have become common tools of governance. Quantification is not a neutral way of describing society, but a process of valorisation. It has three sociologically relevant effects. Firstly, the availability of quantitative data strengthens social comparisons. Secondly, quantitative measurement of social aspects fosters expanded competition. Thirdly, there is a trend towards increased social hierarchisation because representations such as tables, graphs, lists or scores ultimately transform qualitative differences into quantitative inequalities. This paper unfolds the argument that quantitative ascriptions of status ranks change our order of inequality because things that previously could not be compared with each other are made comparable. Moreover, it asks who bears the power of nomination in the regime of numbers and which forms of contestation might be available.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Paananen, Maiju</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores the deployment of numerical criteria in the practices of steering by presenting a local case of governing early childhood education (ECE). In this case, a specific numerical tool for governance, namely, child-staff ratio is used in various ways in the everyday life of preschools. This paper uses data from interviews of preschool teachers and city administrators in charge of organization of ECE in one Finnish municipality and policy documents. The concepts of assemblage are used to explore how child-staff ratio receives various roles in steering the everyday life of preschools. The paper also explores the roles of teachers in the policy assemblages related to child-staff ratio. Focusing on these local-level practices, the article demonstrates that teachers are central components of the fluctuating ECE policy assemblages that involve governing by numbers.</str>

    <str name="description">For over a decade, global university rankings have played a growing role in the status competition in higher education. More recently, we have seen a proliferation in rankings of innovation and urbanization. In this article, we argue that while these new measurements bring with them some conceptual adjustments, they draw heavily on existing rankings and embrace the embedded competitive logic. Local rankings of innovation objectify higher education as an element of global competitiveness. Furthermore, we argue that this logical shift is made with the help university rankings that now come to bridge global competition and local innovation; the existing global university rankings are directly used in the composite indicators of local innovation or their methodology is copied. Consequently, political imaginaries of global competition are now projected to regional and city level.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lim, Miguel Antonio</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) introduced impact as an indicator in the evaluation of higher education research quality in 2014. Impact case studies (ICS) are the basis of this evaluation. ICS use &amp;quot;narrative&amp;quot; explanations of how research causes 'benefits to society'. This article analyses the evolving roles of the ICS and the relationships of ICS with various stakeholders. It draws on insights from legitimacy theory, Porter's analysis of the social meaning of objectivity, and the insight from economist Alan Goodhart on the dysfunctional transformation of indicators into targets. It highlights the challenges to ICS evaluators and shows how a spiral of mistrust can both undermine but also cause demand for numbers. It explores whether impact narratives represent an escape from dominant research evaluation metrics and concludes that they do not.</str>

    <str name="description">While the use of numbers in governance has a long history, the kinds of numbers we now produce enable a range of new possibilities for monitoring, regulation and policy decision-making. Global policy actors are now calling for a steep increase in investment in education data. The growing trust in numbers has been critiqued by education policy scholars and social scientists, who have pointed to the reductionist nature of numbers and the dangerous decontextualisation of information which are leading to detrimental policies. The entry of big data poses even more complex epistemological and ontological challenges, many of which we do not fully understand as yet. This paper acknowledges these challenges, and at the same time speculates that big data might afford unique possibilities for new relational theories that may lead to better policy decision-making.</str>

    <str name="description">This article presents ethnographic research on the aspirations of graduates from a private university in New York City, some of whom move to Los Angeles. Findings depict financial and family pressures exerting a governing force upon the graduates' futures, often beyond their control. Focusing on the narratives of four individuals, we introduce the language of fate as a means of conceptualising the potential repercussions of aspiration and Higher Education. The premise of both is an increased determinacy over one's future, yet in the high-stakes U.S. context here examined, this financial investment and articulation of family hope may generate fated (seemingly inescapable) and/or fateful (ominous) outcomes. The dynamic of 'cruel optimism' illustrates some of the paradoxical consequences of Higher Education, whereby people may be punished by their aspirations. We discuss what factors affect differing outlooks on the future and imply alternative dimensions to adversity beyond the remit of 'inequality'.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Becoming a university graduate has long been considered the route to individual occupational and social mobility, while educating more citizens has been assumed to add to a nation's human capital and competitiveness. University education has come to be associated with individual and societal aspiration. However, changes in the labour market associated with globalisation, technology, and fears of graduate underemployment have served to question this. This paper seeks to uncover the meaning that individuals construct about their early careers as they navigate such uncertain contexts. It reports on a study based on the graduate population of one university in England. Analysis tests the value of &amp;quot;Figured Worlds&amp;quot; theory. Using the construct of 'self-authoring', this paper identifies competing voices around employability and career success. Findings reveal how graduates orchestrate varied voices, in order to find ways to figure their experience and what it means to be a successful graduate.</str>

    <str name="description">Policy and program language in the UK and Australian higher education sectors consistently deploys the term aspiration in ways that adhere to the hegemonic neo-liberal ideal of the entrepreneurial competitor-individual, de-meaning and de-valuing 'other' personhoods. University Equity and Widening Participation (EWP) outreach programs that engage with marginalised groups in school and community settings challenge people to perform particular aspirations from what can be a deeply uncertain present. This paper presents a cautionary tale from the Australian Equity and Widening Participation (EWP) context that emerged from a research-informed practice PhD, spanning two methodologically different phases. The paper argues that the discursive framing of certain aspirations as legitimate works in subtle ways to shape the perceptual horizons of EWP practitioners and participants. Specifically, the work takes issue with policy frames that create conditions for misrecognition(s) that are themselves difficult to re/cognise. A metaphorical pedagogical tool is developed using the Ames Room illusion.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Official policy texts in England have long assumed that students make their Higher Education choices in an individualized, rational and context-free manner. Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition government (2010-2015), a greater emphasis was placed on accomplishing higher levels of widening participation in elite institutions. Those who do not progress to such institutions, or to HE at all, are presented as having 'low aspirations'. Using data from an ESRC funded narrative inquiry of socioeconomically underrepresented Further Education students' HE decision-making and choices, I demonstrate how they aspired highly while initially showing competitive and individualized choice strategies. However, financial constraints led to the renegotiation of their aspirations over time, leading them to compromise for 'reasonable' rather than 'preferred' HE options. Subsequently, this had negative impacts upon the participants' subjectivities. The article provides support for arguments against current individualized conceptualizations of 'aspiration' presented by policy, and proposes approaches to move away from this.</str>

    <str name="description">Today, young adults from lower-income backgrounds are pursuing educational trajectories that would have been distant dreams for their parents. In many Global South countries, this expansion has followed a neoliberal logic in which private universities purport to provide students skills and increased earning capacity, and employers the necessary human capital to compete in global markets. This article examines these processes in Brazil, where federal policies have contributed to a dramatic growth in private, for-profit higher education in recent years. Building on ethnographic research in São Paulo's expansive peripheries, our analysis examines three inter-related themes: higher education and life aspirations; intersectional identity construction; and political/community engagements. We argue that while neoliberal ideologies and policies are a key component of Brazilian higher education, many first-generation college students actively -- and critically -- challenge everyday oppressions and create new life possibilities in the context of enduring inequalities.</str>

      <str>Wallace, Derron</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Drawing on 48 in-depth interviews with Black immigrant and second-generation boys at Bridgewood secondary school in New York City, this article points out how the high educational aspirations expressed by Black African and Caribbean boys are strategically deployed as features of an ethnic project to counter anti-immigrant sentiments and anti-Black racism in US society. The findings indicate that in a context of rising xenophobia along with the historical and continual stereotypes of Black people in the US, participants' aspirations for elite higher education function as strategies to enhance their individual and ethnic reputations. High educational aspirations were also used to justify emigration to and worth within the US. At its core, this article illustrates how participants mobilized aspirations to represent themselves as moral migrants and 'worthy' ethnic minorities. Moral claims and ethnicity-based campaigns associated with aspirations are problematized because they reinforce the hierarchical racial order that informs US society.</str>

    <str name="title">Impersonal Statements: Aspiration and Cruel Optimism in the English Higher Education Application Process</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Houghton, Elizabeth</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Full-time undergraduate applicants to English universities must apply via the University and Colleges Admission Service (UCAS). By analysing the UCAS statements of 15 undergraduate applicants this article attempts to develop a critical understanding of the role that the personal statement has in applicants' formation of themselves as subjects within higher education. The article explores how UCAS's advice around the personal statements draws on discourses that frame higher education as an investment in human capital. Through a textual analysis of applicants' statements, the article explores how applicants come to present themselves as competitive subjects within their personal statements, and suggests they adopt this position not because they are preparing themselves for the unlimited number of student places in higher education, but for the limited number of graduate jobs that await afterwards. The article suggests there is a 'cruel optimism' to this element of the application process, linked to structural inequalities.</str>

    <str name="title">Child as Method: Implications for Decolonising Educational Research</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Burman, Erica</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper advances an approach, 'child as method', as a resource for interrogating models of development in childhood and education. Kuan-Hsing Chen's (2010) book &amp;quot;Asia as method&amp;quot; has generated interest across childhood and educational studies. Here 'child as method' is presented as a related intervention. Just as &amp;quot;Asia as method&amp;quot; (re)considers the status of the national and transnational, so 'child as method' helps explicate the ways 'child' and 'development' are linked across economic, sociocultural and individual trajectories. The example of translation is discussed in relation to sociocultural approaches and how together these might inform childhood and educational studies debates. The notion of 'method' at work (as framework, technique or narrative) is also clarified as informed by feminist and decolonisation approaches. It is argued that 'child as method' offers strategies for resisting abstraction and remaining attentive to forces and relations of (re)production at issue within adult-child and child-state-development relations.</str>

    <str name="title">Spatializing Higher Education: Emirati Women Learners&amp;apos; Hot and Cold Spaces</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Alzeer, Gergana</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article is concerned with the types of lived spaces that emerged from exploring Emirati women learners' spatial experiences in higher education. By conducting an ethnographic qualitative inquiry and by utilizing Lefebvre's triad of the perceived, conceived and lived space and rhythmanalysis as a theoretical framework, two distinctive categories of the lived space emerged: 'Hot' and 'Cold' spaces, with their sub-categorizations. These emergent spaces reveal and reflect Emirati women learners' spatial needs and experiences as manifested through their spatial appropriation and unique rhythms on campus. The findings also extend our understanding and utilization of Lefebvre's abstract triad, specifically the lived space, and confirm how space is neither abstract nor static, but socially constructed, dynamic as well as culturally and contextually bound. The spatial focus of this study offers a novel way of thinking about women's experiences and needs in higher education, thus extending the scholarly work on spatializing education.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Cobb, Donella J.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Open Educational Resources (OERs) have become a global educational phenomenon because of claims that they are a panacea for issues of access and quality. However, little consideration has been given to the social significance of this digital platform, particularly for teachers and students in low-income countries. This article draws on Bernstein's (2000) notion of recontextualisation to investigate the influence of structuring conditions on pedagogy within OERs. The findings of this research demonstrate how wider economic agendas have influenced the recontextualisation of pedagogy within OERs to de-centre learning from the pedagogic relationship.</str>

    <str name="description">The present study explores how officials in Swedish secondary schools define and categorize situations in which students have been exposed to violence in the school. The study is designed as a case study of two secondary schools, situated in two demographically different urban neighbourhoods. The results indicate that different socio-economic conditions influence how professionals categorize and explain violence, but also what strategies are used to deal with different incidents. In the socially disadvantaged area, there is closer collaboration with the police, and filing police reports is more common. In the school located in a middle-class area, professionals handle similar situations by collaborating with parents and using diagnoses as the main explanation for students' problematic behaviour.</str>

    <str name="description">Constructing a secure sense of a professional future has become increasingly difficult for early career researchers, whilst concerns about present and future job in/security have also been expressed in relation to already-established academics. In this paper, we draw on qualitative data from a U.K. study to explore everyday conceptualisations of the future for both 'early career' and 'late career' academics, in the context of increased fears and actualities of occupational precarity. We utilise theories of the social construction of time, as well as a conception of precarity and 'precarization' utilised by Butler (2009a, 2009b) and Lorey (2015), relating to 'politically induced' forms of insecurity that are a direct product of neoliberalism. The research reveals a variety of forms and levels of concern and anxiety by both groups for their own futures, and for the future of the academy as a whole.</str>

    <str name="description">We focus on transition from school or employment to university and analyze how social network characteristics and the quantity of social capital (SC) influence the assessment of help in selecting a program of study. We analyze data of undergraduate students at a German university and find that SC has an amount and a context effect. First, we assume that in networks where students find a lot of SC, they also receive helpful advice. Second, a social network close to academia offers useful help. Our multivariate analyses support the context effect, but also indicate a marginal utility of SC. Students with academically educated parents rate their parents' help as more useful, and students with studying friends rate their friends' advice as helpful. However, students who are rich in SC among family and friends rate their help lower than students who are rich in SC among only one part of their network.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines the justification for a culturally responsive educational initiative to raise the educational underachievement of Maori students in New Zealand. The initiative is justified by claims that the recognition in the classroom of a student's cultural identity will lead to the student's educational achievement. Using an account of a small study of teachers and their beliefs regarding New Zealand's culturally responsive educational policy &amp;quot;Kia Eke Panuku,&amp;quot; we argue that such a claim is not established and it is the development of an epistemic identity which is more likely to be the means for Maori to attain educational success.</str>

      <str>Molla, Tebeje</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Framing professional learning as a social practice underscores the interplay between subjective meaning systems and objective conditions of the social space where learning occurs. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's theory of social practice, and methodologically guided by critical realism, the paper identifies what constitutes effective teacher professional learning through mentoring. The empirical focus of the paper is an Early Childhood teacher mentoring programme in the state of Victoria, Australia. The findings show that: (a) relevant circumstances that make teacher professional learning a necessity are associated with individual aspirations and systemic requirements; (b) collegial relationships and critical deliberation constitute meaningful learning experiences; and (c) teacher learning takes place in the domains of professional dispositions, pedagogical knowledge and social capital. The implication is that in designing professional development programmes such as mentoring, it is important to take teachers' contexts of practice into account; conceptualise learning as a socially situated practice; and recognise the value of teachers' lived experiences as a locus of deliberation and learning.</str>

    <str name="title">Conspicuous Practice: Self-Surveillance and Commodification in English Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Page, Damien</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Teachers in England have always been watched; only more recently have they been surveilled, with senior leaders, peers, students and stakeholders all collecting performance data. Yet surveillance in schools and colleges increasingly relies on watching the self, with teachers voluntarily participating in their own surveillance, making their practice visible for easy consumption by interested parties. This article builds on previous work on the surveillance of teachers to argue that this 'conspicuous practice' represents a convergence of surveillance and consumerism, with teachers being recreated as commodities and their own marketing agent, embodying the entrepreneurial self to maximise employability. Through social media such as Twitter and LinkedIn to exploiting open plan learning spaces, teachers engage in conspicuous practice for three main reasons: from fear, to avoid sanction; as a result of acculturation into commodified environments; as a means of routine resistance, employing the dramaturgical self for personal gain, to avoid work or re-appropriate professionalism.</str>

    <str name="description">Why bother thinking about Freire today? Who cares about the accuracy or lack of it in the translation of his books? In 2018 after 50 years of the original publication of &amp;quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed,&amp;quot; there is a large industry of people profiting from translating and repeating Freire's ideas -- we are well aware that this text is another small contribution to such industry -- but we firmly believe that contemporary social scientists could greatly benefit from reflecting about Freire's long-term powerful conceptual, pedagogical, and political impact, and in particular about the role of translations in the social sciences.</str>

    <str name="description">This article seeks to introduce &amp;quot;Research in translation&amp;quot; as a new section of the journal. Its goals are to expand and diversify the flow of ideas in the sociology of education, to make available perspectives and notions from other research traditions to readers from diverse parts of the world, and to enrich the conversations about how these movements transform the ways in which social knowledge about education is produced. This introduction underlines that research is always produced in and as translation between different sets of practices and registers; it also wants to visibilize the craft of translation and its effects in the production of knowledge in an increasingly internationalized, plurilingual academia.</str>

    <str name="description">This study examines the effects of family socio-economic disadvantage and differences in school resources on student achievement in the city of Cartagena, Colombia. Using data from the ICFES and C-600 national databases, we conduct a multilevel analysis to determine the unique contribution of school-level factors above and beyond family background. The results from the hierarchical linear models show that while family socio-economic background significantly affects student achievement, school composition and school resources explain as much as half of the effects of family background. More specifically, the achievement gap in public schools is explained in large part by differential resource allocation and concentration of poor students in public schools, which in turn lowers student achievement.

    <str name="description">Len Barton has pioneered the sociological study of education in the areas of disability studies and inclusive education. This paper addresses an argument developed by Len Barton that social exclusion, of which disablism is one element, (1) has many compounding forms of differing exclusions, (2) is not a natural but a socially constructed process, (3) has no single factor that can remove it and (4) is in constant need of conceptual analysis. Our paper aims to address each of these four challenging themes in relation to the contemporary societal position of disabled children, their families and key professionals that work around them, with a specific focus on schools. First, we explore the ways in which disabled childhoods are imbricated with other forms of exclusion. Second, we consider the ways in which &amp;quot;disability&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;impairment&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;child&amp;quot; are consistently being reproduced in particular and often contradictory ways by disability discourses. Third, we consider the need to work with numerous forms of educational intervention that address the exclusion of disabled children. Fourth, we conclude with an appeal to develop disability studies in ways that build on the shoulders of (social model) greats--such as Len Barton--whilst being receptive to other transformative perspectives from queer, feminist and postcolonial studies.</str>

    <str name="description">Security is an integral component of the relationships that shape the lives of students hosted by foreign countries. International student security became a source of contention between nations in 2008 when China's Government charged that Australia was failing to adequately provide for the safety of Chinese students. We discuss Beck's theorisation of the &amp;quot;risk society&amp;quot; and Clements' notion of balancing risk with opportunity. We draw on interviews undertaken in Beijing to highlight the importance of student security and the need for hosts to accord attention to the views of parents as well as students. Our findings reveal that parents play a major role in the study-location decision, tend to accord security greater weight than do students when location is being debated within the family, utilise a range of strategies to keep students secure and believe host governments and institutions have primary responsibility for student well-being.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    </arr>
    <str name="description">The growth of surveillance in UK schools in recent years has resulted in the development of what can be labelled as the surveillance curriculum. Operating through the overt and hidden curricula, contemporary surveillance practices and technologies not only engage students in a discourse of control, but also increasingly socialise them into a &amp;quot;culture of observation&amp;quot; in which they learn to watch and be watched, accepting unremitting monitoring as a norm. This paper examines how the surveillance curriculum operates through observation, discourse and simulation, before drawing upon elements of Gary Marx's typology of resistance to consider student responses to new surveillance technologies, such as CCTV and Internet monitoring devices. It is concluded that although the surveillance curriculum seeks to control, it also provides a space within which students can forge their own identities through playful resistance, (re)configuring the &amp;quot;algebra of surveillance&amp;quot;.</str>

    <str name="description">In the last half century higher education has had to respond to a rapidly accentuated process of globalisation. Consequently, universities worldwide are more concerned with internationalisation than before. Stier identifies three intrinsic internationalisation ideologies (idealism, instrumentalism and educationalism) in higher education. Drawing from these ideologies and using discourse analysis, written documentation on internationalisation from 31 universities in 12 countries has been analysed to explore the self-presentations that universities project of themselves in discursive space. Focal questions were: (1) what types of rhetorical devices are used in university's self-presentations and (2) what are the ideological consequences of this use? Five ideal typical self-presentations were discussed. One conclusion drawn is that universities must harmonize politically controversial dichotomies, which produces consensus narratives. Yet there are potential tensions between these dichotomies. On the language level these tensions are resolved by harmonising different ideals. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Reproduction theories emphasised the idea that schools reproduce relations of oppression. Later, postmodernism has increased the language of impossibility by analysing all educational actions in terms of power relations. Therefore, educational actions in line with any of those sociological approaches cannot act as tools that schools and communities need today to tackle inequalities from education and thus contribute to social inclusion. But sociology of education is already on the move. It has become dialogic, studying and showing that, actually, there are Successful Educational Actions (SEAs) worldwide that challenge structures and provide all children with the education they deserve to not only have equal chances but also, and more importantly, equal results. This dialogic sociology of education develops in dialogue with social agents and, as a result, has greater chances to improve their lives. (Contains 5 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">Racism in Europe is an ongoing reality that shapes many people's everyday lives. Diversity is often perceived as a barrier to social cohesion or educational success. These discourses are very often translated into measures that tend to assimilate or segregate those with a migrant or minority background. In this article, drawing from the results of the INCLUD-ED project, it is argued that through the implementation of successful actions diversity can be turned into an opportunity to enhance learning and social cohesion.

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Given the increasing power of neoliberal and neoconservative agendas in education internationally, critically democratic policies and practices are now even more important. Yet, one of the major problems with critical work in education has been the fact that some of the academic leaders of the &amp;quot;critical pedagogy&amp;quot; movement and of critical and democratic education in general in many nations have not been sufficiently connected to the actual realities of schools and classrooms. Yet, only when it is linked much more to concrete issues of educational policy and practice--and to the daily lives of educators, students, social movements and community members--can a critical and democratic education succeed. I point to a number of such linkages and suggest that because of this the ways we think about the role of education in social transformation needs to be made more nuanced and complex.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">The Dialogic Inclusion Contract (DIC) makes it possible to build a dialogue between the international scientific community and the knowledge derived from the experiences of social agents. This article presents the theoretical underpinnings and the process of developing and implementing the DIC. A case study of a primary school in a disadvantaged area illustrates how the DIC helped transform an isolated and impoverished neighbourhood into one with more hope and prospects. In this case, the DIC led to the implementation of successful actions that improved students' academic achievement and school attendance as well as relationships between students and between the school and the community. Now, given the very positive results of the DIC in the school, the community around it has decided to transform the entire neighbourhood following the same approach. Evidence from this school indicates that all voices must be included in any effort to overcome ghettos. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    <str name="description">The scientific community has provided a wide range of evidence that family and community involvement in schools benefits not only students' learning but also their surrounding community. The INCLUD-ED project has conducted case studies of successful schools around Europe that have strong community participation. Some of them are engaged in the Learning Communities project, an international project of educational and social transformation aimed at overcoming school failure. Through these case studies, INCLUD-ED has gone beyond the state of the art in the field and has provided a classification of types of family and community participation and identified forms of involvement that improve students' academic achievement. This article presents the benefits of those forms of participation and focuses on some forms of community involvement in the Learning Communities that have been found to improve students' school learning and other education-related aspects, such as living together.

    <str name="description">The INCLUD-ED project's case studies of successful schools in Europe reveal that there are advantages involved in opening schools to all kinds of women as far as educational and social inclusion is concerned. &amp;quot;Other Women&amp;quot;--those whose voices have traditionally been silenced in academic settings--help in crucial ways to improve education when they have the chance to participate in multiple spaces and activities in the school. By participating in decision-making bodies, in classrooms and in family education, amongst other activities, the &amp;quot;Other Women&amp;quot; enhance students' learning, improve living together and break down cultural and gender stereotypes. All these findings point to the need to open schools to all women to advance processes of educational transformation. (Contains 2 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">

    <str name="description">The sociology of education in New Zealand, as in other countries, is affected by the dilemma inherent to the discipline, namely: is it a sociology &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; education or a sociology &amp;quot;for&amp;quot; education? In this article I analyse three factors in which the dilemma is played out: &amp;quot;cultural oppositionism&amp;quot; in the indigenous (kaupapa Maori) approach, critical policy research and the role of empirical research. I argue that a sociology &amp;quot;for&amp;quot; education is fundamentally weakened by its politicisation, a flaw not helped by the difficulties in drawing political goals from moral imperatives. In contrast a sociology &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; education, which uses the strengths of empirical research and theoretical analysis, offers the better hope of renewal for, what is, in New Zealand, a moribund discipline.

    <str name="description">This paper draws on an ESRC-funded study of policy enactments in English secondary schools (RES-062-23-1484) based on case-study work in four similar &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; schools. The study has two main objectives; to develop a theory of policy enactment and to explore empirically the differences in the enactment of policy in similar contexts. Taking these objectives as drivers for analysis, this paper explores the way that managing behaviour is translated and enacted in institutional policy and practice. This paper argues that behaviour, classroom management and student &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; continue to be significant aspects of education policy and practice in schools. It examines what is involved in policy enactment from a policy sociology perspective. Some examples of &amp;quot;doing&amp;quot; discipline policy work are then considered. The paper argues that policy, even when it is centrally mandated, is translated, adjusted and worked on differently by diverse sets of policy actors. Thus, variability and distinctiveness characterise policy enactments at the different levels of practice within and between individual, but similar, schools. (Contains 2 notes.)</str>

      <str>Apple, Michael W.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In the process of discussing the significant contributions that Len Barton has made to the sociology of education and to disability studies, I argue that a good deal of critical analyses of power and inequality in education are impoverished by some of their essentialist and reductive tendencies. I use an example taken from disability rights to show how parts of these tendencies can be overcome. I suggest that disability rights movements provide powerful possibilities for the interruption of capitalist ideological forms and their attendant ways of organising and controlling labour. They do this by challenging some of the most fundamental assumptions that underpin capitalist economies and ways of life. By strongly resisting the ways in which paid work and paid workers are treated, new relations are made possible. I connect this example to some of the insightful analyses of the place of affective equality in the struggle for social justice in both a politics of redistribution and a politics of recognition. Building on these arguments, I then argue for a broadened conception of critical research and critical action. I describe nine tasks in which the critical scholar/activists should engage if they are to be true to an enlarged conception of the "public intellectual" and "public sociologist".

      <str>Acker, Sandra</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article looks at women's efforts to construct an academic leadership career. It is not a study of women's leadership in general but one that takes place in what Bourdieu calls the academic field. Drawing from an in-depth interview study of 31 women from faculties of education who occupy managerial positions in universities in Canada, Australia or Britain, I focus on four contrasting case studies. For some women it is possible to build a satisfying academic leadership career, while for others, the surrounding contradictions encourage a more or less graceful end to leadership ambitions. I question the circumstances under which women attempting to construct academic leadership careers will be &amp;quot;fish in water&amp;quot; or show a &amp;quot;feel for the game&amp;quot;, as well as the potential and problems of the game metaphor itself in this context.

    <str name="description">New additional support-needs legislation in Scotland sought to recognise the way in which poverty, as well as individual impairment, contribute to the creation of children's difficulties in learning. As well as identifying a wider range of needs, the legislation sought to provide parents, irrespective of social background, with more powerful means of challenging local authority decisions on resource allocation, with the aim of delivering a fairer system. This paper uses Scottish Government statistics and family case studies drawn from an ESRC-funded project (RES-062-23-0803) to examine the links between social deprivation, the identification of additional support needs and parents' ability to use the new dispute resolution mechanisms. There is a strong association between the identification of additional support needs and social deprivation and this is particularly marked in relation to non-normative difficulties, such as social, emotional and behavioural difficulties, compared with normative difficulties such as blindness and deafness. Statutory educational plans, which provide greater rights to additional resources and formal dispute resolution mechanisms, are disproportionately distributed to parents in more advantaged neighbourhoods. Parents from middle-class backgrounds appear to be able to use their social and cultural capital more effectively to challenge local authority decisions. The paper concludes that some funding for additional support needs should be allocated on the basis of social deprivation, but there continues to be a need for the assessment and resourcing of individual needs, since poverty has material consequences for individual children, whose difficulties may be overlooked if an entirely systemic approach is adopted. There is a need for greater investment in advocacy service to enable parents from poorer backgrounds to exercise their rights. (Contains 2 figures, 1 table and 1 note.)</str>

      <str>Liasidou, Anastasia</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores the contribution of sociological scholarship to understanding and analysing the notions of "special educational needs" and "disability" and the ways in which the two notions have been reconfigured and theorised as "public issues" rather than "personal troubles". Barton's contribution is signified both in terms of his contribution to the evolution of the "sociological imagination"--as a powerful theoretical tool for unravelling the highly political and contested nature of disability and special educational needs--and also in terms of his analysis of the emergence and development of sociological theorising in the field. The parochial obsession with deficit and medical-oriented approaches to dealing with "difference" and "need" have been significantly challenged through the "sociological imagination" aimed at pointing up the highly political and complex nature of disability and "special educational needs". Times have changed and sociological theorising has evolved, but presumed "personal troubles" are still not unequivocally conceptualised as being intertwined with, resting upon and emanating from "public issues" embedded in the social, cultural and political edifice of educational, social and national communities. The "sociological imagination" should be constantly invoked and deployed in order to expose and challenge the sophisticated ways in which individual pathology accounts and special educational imperatives re-invent themselves through more inclusive linguistic veneers.</str>

    <str name="description">Research on welfare state regimes and research on educational policy share a common concern for the reduction of social inequality. On one hand, welfare state research is typically designed within a comparative approach where scholars investigate similarities and differences in social institutions across selected countries. On the other hand, the basic model of educational policy research is usually country specific and seldom identifies why and how we are to understand cross-national differences pertaining to social inequality. The goal of the research is to bridge these two areas by testing socio-economic gradients and educational outcomes among 15 industrialised countries (using 2003 PISA data) from a welfare state perspective. Results support Esping-Andersen's &amp;quot;three worlds&amp;quot; typology in that the level of between-school educational inequality is the highest in conservative welfare states and is the lowest in social-democratic countries.

      <str>Resnik, Julia</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The adoption of multiculturalism and multiethnic views of society seems to be a convergent tendency among Western democracies where population flows are becoming increasingly heterogeneous. However, the established citizenship models and migrant groups' experiences have different impacts on the multicultural discourse in each country. This &amp;quot;integration without assimilation&amp;quot; thesis has been examined comparing two countries--Israel and France--that differ largely in their definition of nationhood. Despite large demographic changes in both countries, the evolution of conceptions of citizenship in France and in Israel reflects a reaffirmation of existing models--the particularist Israeli ethno-nationalism and the universalist French republicanism and laicite--and the continuity of their assimilationist and homogenizing tendencies towards a Jewish uniform identity in the former and towards a uniform secular (or catho-laique) identity in the latter.

    <str name="description">The invaluable use of ethnography in researching educational settings has been demonstrated through many studies and furthered by many passionate researchers. One of such leading lights is Geoffrey Walford. In this paper, Walford's discussion of groups in two public schools, as depicted in his book &amp;quot;Life in public schools&amp;quot;, serves as a basis for my investigation of the &amp;quot;lived experiences&amp;quot; of Southeast Asian boarders in St Andrew's School, a private all boy's boarding school in Perth, Western Australia. This article introduces this group of boarders and examines their perceptions that maintained their group identity in the boarding house environment. Interviews conducted with the boarders are drawn into this inquiry, underlining their views that group identity is important to living in a boarding school. (Contains 2 notes and 1 figure.)</str>

    <str name="title">Picturing Success: Young Femininities and the (Im)Possibilities of Academic Achievement in Selective, Single-Sex Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Allan, Alexandra</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Over the last decade it is young women who have come to be widely understood as the bearers of educational qualifications. It is girls who are now seen to have &amp;quot;the world at their feet&amp;quot; and to be able to attain the glittering prizes of academic success associated with elite universities and top occupations. And it is upper-middle-class girls, in particular, who appear to be achieving the most; a &amp;quot;super class&amp;quot; of pupils who are supposedly able to effortlessly succeed in everything that they do. Drawing on ethnographic data generated during a research project in a single-sex, selective girls' school this paper will explore what it meant for one group of elite girls to achieve and succeed in school. The paper will examine the different versions of success made available to the girls in this school, the girls' differing relations to these discourses and their intersection with other relations of power. The paper will question the popular post-feminist picture of the smart, sassy and successful &amp;quot;top girl&amp;quot; who is able to &amp;quot;have it all&amp;quot; and in the conditions of her own choosing. The paper will suggest that, even for the girls in this school, success was not easy to perform or &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; for oneself. Despite attending a school where success was openly celebrated, the paper will demonstrate the ways in which many girls still felt restricted to perform success in narrow and competitive ways that clashed with dominant discourses of femininity.</str>

    <str name="description">It is now nearly thirty years since Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative administration introduced the Assisted Places Scheme (their first education policy) and over ten years since New Labour abolished it. The Scheme, which was designed to provide a ladder of opportunity for academically able students from poor backgrounds to attend private schools, is of more than historical interest. It can be used to illuminate enduring sociological concerns about the relationship between home and school. This paper draws on retrospective interview data to reveal how the Scheme was experienced by its more disadvantaged beneficiaries. Revisiting classic sociological analyses from the 1960s and 1970s, it unravels the complex interactions between home background, friendship networks and school cultures and shows how these contributed to contrasting experiences of commitment, detachment, estrangement and alienation. These differing modes of engagement with schooling appear to have had lasting effects on our respondents and influenced their subsequent careers and orientations.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Forsey, Martin</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Based mainly on my own ethnographic research, which is committed to uncovering the constructed or &amp;quot;practiced&amp;quot; nature of social life, I seek to demonstrate the ways in which Australian school teachers, administrators, students and parents are engaged in a re-productive process that simultaneously reinforces and reinvents schools and schooling. Set against a backdrop of concern bordering on panic among some groups about middle-class flow away from Australian government schools, this paper explores the practices of social class and its structurating effects. A sample is presented of the ways in which those working in Australian schools tend to direct their energies towards ensuring market share of middle-class students, a practice emerging out of beliefs and experiences that lead teachers to find middle-class schools &amp;quot;stimulating and encouraging places to teach in&amp;quot;, in contrast to the &amp;quot;disruptive&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;wearing&amp;quot; working-class schools. The study raises important questions not just about how we want to organize our schools and education system, but ultimately about what sort of society are we seeking to re-produce right here, right now?

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Pring, Richard</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper suggests that, in contrast to the great reports such as Crowther, Newsom Robbins and Plowden, recent government papers relating to education in England pay little attention to values that should shape the standards to be achieved, the knowledge to be transmitted and the virtues to be nourished. Whilst legislation over the past 60 years has promoted a vision of &amp;quot;education for all&amp;quot;, what has predominated has been a concept of learning restricted to that which privileges the small number who can perform well within a narrowly defined understanding of academic studies. It is argued that the need to measure and standardise performance has resulted in a marginalisation of the broader vision of learning, which should be pursued in order to enable us to live fully human lives. Such an approach will require a transformation of educational ideals and refusal to accept the reductionist practices inherent in the language of performance management. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

Using the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England, we analyse both year 10 subject choices and the factors that may motivate these choices, such as liked and disliked subjects, attitudes to subject choice and the extent to which choices were shaped by parents, teachers or the young people themselves. The social structure of curriculum choice is mapped using Multiple Correspondence Analysis, which reveals the hierarchy of subjects. (Contains 1 table and 5 figures.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Pasztor, Adel</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article examines the applicability of Ball's categorisation of ethnic minority students as contingent and embedded choosers in the context of higher education choice. Considering the role of the selective school system in shaping the educational careers of the children of Turkish immigrants in the Netherlands the study uses case studies to illustrate the interplay of social class background with the educational structure. The cases of educationally successful second-generation Turks interviewed in the city of Amsterdam clearly illustrate the significance of early tracking in regulating the educational outcomes of pupils of immigrant origin, thus determining their chances for educational advancement and social mobility.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Andreotti, Vanessa</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Roger Openshaw and Elizabeth Rata conceptualise Kaupapa Maori as a dominant intellectual orthodoxy in New Zealand, which creates a &amp;quot;culturalist ideological conformity&amp;quot; that limits the university's ability to serve as the critical conscience of society. They argue for the primacy of academic objectivity as the criteria for what counts as &amp;quot;weighty inquiry&amp;quot; and against essentialism and cultural elitism. This paper offers a situated reading of Openshaw and Rata's statements against the arguments of indigenous and postcolonial theorists who also challenge essentialism and cultural elitism, such as Marie Battiste, Homi Bhabha, Gayatri Spivak and Jacqui Alexander. This paper also outlines the framework for a dialogical contestatory ethos, which emerges from these theories as a way forward beyond absolute relativism and cultural supremacism in the academic debate.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Darmanin, Mary</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores the coincidence of global, supranational and local demands on a small EU member state. Pressures to open up an internal and external market in further and higher education (F&amp;amp;HE) derive from outside the local education state, most notably from the &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot; economy's competition imperative, from the obligations of EU membership regarding employment and Research and Development and from local demands for labour market growth. Normatively employing neoliberal market discourses, lead actors provide a number of cushions for the market, which include not only disinvestment and commodification, but also (ir)regulation, through the delays in establishing a regulatory framework, leading to a specific spatio-temporal fix. Using the metaphor of a &amp;quot;two-goal cushion&amp;quot;, this article asks whether the cushions themselves may not lead to the jeopardy of F&amp;amp;HE goals, especially regarding access, quality and increased Research Development Training and Innovation (RDTi)? Here, the portability of competitive market F&amp;amp;HE policies from the supranational to the local, and from the local ICT training industry to the tertiary education sector, provide evidence not only of &amp;quot;cushions&amp;quot;, but also of how F&amp;amp;HE &amp;quot;market&amp;quot; policy is traded between discursive sites and scales.

    <str name="description">With reference to an ESRC/TLRP project conducted across two academic years with working-class students in higher education (HE), this paper explores the relationship between geographies of home and those of university at two UK HE institutions. It addresses how social relations inflected by class influence the experience of students as they adapt to new socio-cultural environments and negotiate the terms of their emergent identities. By indicating the ways in which HE experiences are classed, but also situated and connected across geographical locations, this paper examines the ties between forms of working-class identity and the contexts through which they are reproduced. In different ways, the security of locality and of what and who is already known is seen here as critical in dealing with risky and often alien educational environments as a form of social capital.

    <str name="title">&amp;quot;Sexing the Subject&amp;quot;: Evoking &amp;quot;Sex&amp;quot; in Teaching an Undergraduate Course about Sexuality</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Allen, Louisa</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper seeks to explore the relation between sexuality and pedagogy. This theoretical concern is examined with reference to two key pedagogical moments during a first-year undergraduate course about schooling and sexuality. Through critical reflection of these episodes it is argued that when sexuality is the intellectual focus of a course, the pedagogical scene becomes inescapably &amp;quot;sexual&amp;quot;. While existing research analyses desire between teacher and student as a potential element of the pedagogical scene, this paper investigates how sexuality might manifest more generally and offer a pedagogical resource in educational encounters. The possibility of a sexual and embodied pedagogy that explicitly invites students to be sexual subjects in a space that traditionally prioritises mind over body is considered. How teacher and student subjects are invoked and to what ends this might be pedagogically productive are also investigated.</str>

    <str name="description">Increased academic attention has been drawn to democratisation in higher education, following the implementation of affirmative action in America. However, the models of Access policies presented by certain European educational systems deserve more attention. France and Britain share a common position on elitism, although they define it according to very different principles: on the one hand, France emphases the old model of meritocracy through academic performance, whereas in Britain, some institutions still tend to favour a more hereditary transmission of ethos. A comprehensive comparison of &amp;quot;positive discrimination&amp;quot; and Outreach policies allows us to try and rebuild the political conditions (and debates) around the implementation of these policies, which now target individuals rather than the usual macrosocial or territorial categories. Regulation patterns--although not yet finalised--reveal to some extent a general willingness for &amp;quot;potential and ability assessment&amp;quot;, which would make recruitment systems for higher education in both France and Britain less socially exclusive.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Mayo, Peter</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper focuses on the EU discourse on Higher Education and analyses this discourse within the context of globalisation. Importance is attached to the issues of lifelong learning, competitiveness, diversification, entrepreneurship, access, knowledge society, modernisation, quality assurance, innovation and creativity, governance and business-HE partnerships. The paper also provides a critical analysis of this discourse focusing on certain issues involved in policy borrowing and transfer, the corporatisation of HE, international competition with the USA and Asia and the implications of all these aspects of the dominant EU HE policy discourse for HE and the public sphere. The paper seeks to tease out the tension that exists in the discourse between neo-liberal tenets and the idea of a Social Europe. References throughout the paper will be made to the situation concerning HE in a variety of contexts in Europe. (Contains 7 notes.)</str>

    <str name="title">Diversity, Gender and Widening Participation in Global Higher Education: A Feminist Perspective</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>David, Miriam E.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article provides an overview of global higher education focusing particularly on issues of diversity and gender. The main evidence is drawn from seven unique projects on Widening Participation in Higher Education funded by the British Government's Higher Education Funding Council for England and administered through the Economic and Social Research Council's Teaching and Learning Research Programme. The issues are contextualised from a feminist perspective, current global and national policy debates about extending fair access to, and participation within, higher education and the contestation about these debates on global higher education in the twenty-first century. Whilst there is clear evidence that participation in higher education has increased, especially for women, by contrast with traditional students defined as young, white, male and middle-class, this participation is neither equal nor fairly distributed. There are systemic and systematic inequalities but, nevertheless, opportunities for critical and feminist pedagogies within the global academy have increased and offer the potential for the future of the twenty-first-century global academy.</str>

    <arr name="author">

    <str name="description">Academic development has played a significant role in creating university &amp;quot;learning and teaching&amp;quot; as an object of policy scrutiny and intervention. While academic development is a new field, its practices have been productive of new learning and teaching regimes in both the global &amp;quot;north&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;south&amp;quot;. This paper explores the emergence of academic development as a practice and the agentic understandings of its actors in creating the academic development project in the face of global unevenness. The paper offers a critical account of the emergence of academic development practice in both the global &amp;quot;north&amp;quot;, drawing on the intertwined histories of the UK and Australia, and in the global &amp;quot;south&amp;quot;, drawing on the example of South Africa. In looking at the ongoing debates about academic development the paper argues that in constituting teaching and learning as its object, other more radical, feminist and critical pedagogies, which are capable of dealing with the power and curricula, were marginalised.

    <str name="description">Higher education within the USA is increasingly perceived to be in a state of crisis. This crisis exposes the USA and its citizens to risks that spell out disaster whether it is from a loss of national global competitiveness, a reduction in the standard of living and/or deep challenges to social cohesion. The suggested remedy to this condition is to transform current educational practices and institutions to better produce "knowledge workers" who in turn may harness the limitless potentials of a "global knowledge economy". While this vision of education seems compelling we argue that the transition to a "knowledge economy" is more fiction than fact. Instead we suggest that the "knowledge economy" is better understood as part of "risk society" where education does not reduce the anxiety associated with developed post-industrial economies, but serves to exasperate it.

    <str name="description">Higher education policy and research tend to be dominated by the messaging systems of the North. De Sousa Santos argues that we need to start listening to the South and that we need to develop a sociology of absences. This paper attempts to engage with some of these absences by deconstructing participation in higher education, in quantitative and qualitative terms, in Ghana and Tanzania. The paper is based on interim findings from a research project on Economic and Social Research Council/Department for International Development-funded research project on Widening Participation in Higher Education in Ghana and Tanzania: Developing an Equity Scorecard (www.sussex.ac.uk/education/wideningparticipation). It argues that, while globally the higher education sector has become associated with economic development and the hyper modernisation of the knowledge economy, some archaic patterns of participation appear to be continuing.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Stavrou, Sophia</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper focuses on the curricular change in French universities that has taken place over the last two decades and especially since the implementation of the &amp;quot;LMD Reform&amp;quot; in 2002. Curricula tend to become &amp;quot;regionalised-knowledge&amp;quot; courses, by regrouping disciplinary knowledge and looking forward to economic and social needs. The article aims at analysing the process of producing this change. The first proposition is to show that change is not a linear process, but an ongoing process of negotiation undertaken by a wide range of institutions, social groups and agents, who operate in different institutional levels (European-level, State-level, university/local-level or pedagogic/local-level). The second proposition is that these negotiation procedures mask the differences in the social basis of each one of these discourses and, thus, mask conflict and struggle over social control in higher education reforms.

    <str name="description">Low teacher morale, coupled with extremely poor schooling outcomes for students as measured on standardized tests have increasingly been reported in the media in South Africa. As elsewhere, there is growing demand for the reorganisation of teachers' work in order to enhance school performance. The paper investigates the ways in which current market-led government policies have sustained past inequalities between schools and between teachers. Drawing on Savage's notion of assets, the analysis focuses on how the material and organisational conditions of teachers' work combine to affect teachers' morale. The analysis is based on available sets of data on inequalities--at the societal level, at the level of the homes and communities of the children that attend school, at the level of schooling system and at the level of teachers. It proposes a conceptual typology in relation to the four levels of data we provide, which shows interesting differential effects on teachers' morale and the transformation of teachers' work in South Africa. We argue that the relations between enduring economic inequalities in South Africa, an underspecified new curriculum and the bureaucratization of teachers' work have created an intractable pattern of accumulation of educational disparity among teachers in South Africa. Teacher morale needs to be considered in the context of these structural conditions. (Contains 7 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Ben-Tsur, Dalia</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper explores the impact of conflict on international student mobility. Through an examination of undergraduate, international students studying in Israel, this case study questions how and if a situation of ongoing violent conflict affects international student travel decisions to study in a host country. Contrary to assumptions of marketisation of higher education in which international students make market choices based on the pursuit of rational self-interest to acquire competitive academic credentials, this study uncovers alternative motivating factors for international student mobility. Findings from this study reveal that ideological and religious affiliation to a host country may motivate international student mobility towards conflict zones. This study suggests that under these circumstances, international student mobility towards a conflict zone may persevere. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    <str name="description">This study estimates the trends of school segregation in Catalonia (Spain) between 2001 and 2006. Currently, new immigration has reopened the debate about the &amp;quot;Other Catalans&amp;quot; triggered by concern with the integration of the incoming population. An &amp;quot;intersectional approach&amp;quot; to social divisions suggests that class and ethnic school segregation responds to strategic parental choice and informal policy arrangements. School segregation indices report a more even distribution in most localities, reinforced isolation of &amp;quot;foreign students&amp;quot; in a few public schools in some large cities and a persistent divide between more comprehensive public schools and selective private-dependent schools in a variety of towns. According to these findings, the analytical approach points at some clues to make sense of impact of distributive policies, the influence of policy contradictions and the success of mobilisation and lobbying political strategies.

    <str name="title">Travelling Theory: Western Knowledge and Its Indian Object</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Seth, Sanjay</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">From the 1830s the colonial government in India became the agency for the promotion of &amp;quot;Western education&amp;quot;, that is, education that sought to disseminate modern, Western, rational knowledge through modern institutions and pedagogic processes. This paper examines a historical episode in which certain key categories of modern Western thought were pressed into service to explain a consequence of the dissemination of Western knowledge in colonial India. The episode in question was that of the alleged &amp;quot;moral crisis&amp;quot; of the educated Indian, who, many argued, had been plunged into confusion and moral disarray following his exposure to Western knowledge in the schools and universities established by his British ruler. In the discourse of moral crisis, the knowledge being disseminated through Western education was simultaneously put to use in explaining an unanticipated effect of this education. How adequate was Western knowledge to explaining its own effects? More generally--for this paper is drawn from a larger study of how modern Western knowledge &amp;quot;travelled&amp;quot; when transplanted to colonial India--what is the status of the knowledge we produce when we &amp;quot;apply&amp;quot; the categories of modern Western thought in order to understand or explain India?

    <str name="description">The paper focuses on the auditing and accountancy paradigm that has dominated educational measurement of pupil performance for the last 20 years in England. The advocates of this minimum competency paradigm do not take account of the results of its dominance. These results include ignoring the heterogeneous complexity of groups within societies that exist now internationally and the reduction in pedagogy and curriculum experience to a &amp;quot;one-size-fits-all&amp;quot; model of teaching concentrated on the tested subjects. This is complemented by the &amp;quot;recitation script&amp;quot; style of pedagogy in schools based on coverage, delivery, completion and measurement rather than interpretation and analysis to support the complexity and diversity of individual learning needs.

      <str>Muller, Johan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper enquires into the grounds for convergence of judgements in a situation of blind peer review, where reviewers are asked to assess the standing of scholars in a disciplinary field. The paper first considers traditional accounts of peer review and threats to its reliability and validity. Next it examines the grounds for disciplinary sociality and different forms of expertise that stratify the disciplinary field. The paper will report the results of an initial study of peer review judgements in the disciplines of Law, Psychology and Historical Studies. The paper will conclude by assessing the variable merits of micro- and macro-sociological explanations in accounting for the phenomenon of convergent disciplinary judgements. A case will be made for the explanatory power of social norms. (Contains 2 figures and 2 tables.)</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines the concept of &amp;quot;White racism&amp;quot; in relation to the experiences of Gypsy and Traveller groups in England. It is based on ethnographic research conducted in two secondary schools during the years 2006-2009. Interviews were carried out with pupils attending the secondary schools, their mothers and members of the Traveller Education Service. The research reveals that racism experienced by White Gypsy and Traveller groups is understood differently to that experienced by non-White minority ethnic groups. This is further related to how Gypsy and Traveller groups are perceived inside and outside schools, as &amp;quot;others&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;outsiders&amp;quot;. The article considers discourses around racism and discrimination and how they might work to disadvantage Gypsy and Traveller groups in schools. (Contains 7 notes.)</str>

    <str name="title">Exploring How Social Capital Works for Children Who Have Experienced School Turbulence: What Is the Role of Friendship and Trust for Children in Poverty?</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Brown, Ceri</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper is concerned with the role of friendship in the construction of social capital within schools for students in poverty. It undertakes an analysis of friendship through the lens of students who have experienced turbulence. "Turbulence" refers to a type of pupil mobility between schools (not to be confused with social mobility) understood as when a child enters or leaves school at a non-standard time. An examination of the ways in which "turbulent" children seek to make friendships provides an opportunity to consider the ways in which different types of friendships affect the construction of social capital in school. This paper examines these processes for six "turbulent" children from low-income families, and explores the different orientations to the construction of social capital between these children and their non-"turbulent" friends. This study extends our understanding of the role of friendship in the construction of social capital and may help to develop an agenda for considering the importance of friendship, social capital and education for children in poverty.

    <str name="title">The Role of Family in Vocational Education and Training Choices: A Case Study in Vietnam</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Dormeier Freire, Alexandre</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article examines the role of family in vocational education and training (VET) choices, using primary qualitative data collected in the commune of Hung An, Vietnam. The authors demonstrate that, next to issues relating to income, it is family characteristics that are the predominant influence on an individual's choice of the VET track, usually portrayed as the &amp;quot;choice of the poor&amp;quot;. The article seeks to investigate family educational roles in an Asian Confucian context in transition, such as Vietnam. To understand the role of family in VET choices, the analytical framework looks at the interactions between children and family by combining the level of familial control over children's choices with the family's degree of &amp;quot;openness&amp;quot;, that is, their ability to mobilise external social resources. Findings on control and &amp;quot;openness&amp;quot; show that choosing VET is primarily related to the aspirations of children to become emancipated more rapidly, and to familial educational history and background. Families also see investment in VET as a minor risk and a reinforcement of their social status. The data interpretation shows that VET students are more autonomous in their educational decisions and rely more on peers, in part because their parents and family struggle to mobilise the social resources needed to make the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; educational choice for their children.

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article analyses the &amp;quot;soft power&amp;quot; that the Federal Government of Brazil has gained by designing and implementing a very ambitious Plan for the Development of Education. It draws on fieldwork carried out in the country in 2009 and 2010 in order to conduct a discourse analysis of the strategy deployed by the key political agents. The results show to what extent the Federal Government has used some catchwords to underpin a general consensus. It has also convinced the international organisations and civil society organisations that the &amp;quot;programme ontology&amp;quot; of the programme (e.g. hypotheses on the beneficial impacts of multi-dimensional intervention) is reliable enough to wait for a decade until having a whole evaluation. However, since these agents eventually recall varied kinds of political mobilisation, some contradictions and tensions are already apparent. In general, the analysis unveils a complex interplay of national and supranational politics of education. (Contains 21 notes and 2 tables.)</str>

    <str name="description">The International Baccalaureate's (IB) branding and reputation targets academic high achievers aiming for university entrance. This is an empirical examination of the growing popularity of this transnational secondary credential amongst local populations in Australia, focusing on its uptake across the community, and the discourses underpinning its spread and popularity. This paper reports on online surveys of 179 parents and 231 students in schools offering the IB as an alternative to Australian state curricula. It sets out to understand the social ecology of who chooses the IB and who it chooses. Statistically significant differences between IB and non-IB choosers were found in terms of family income, parent education, student aspirations, transnational lifestyles and neoconservative, neoliberal and cosmopolitan beliefs. The analysis demonstrates how the reproduction of advantage is accomplished through choice behaviours in stratified educational markets. (Contains 8 tables.)</str>

    <str name="description">This paper explores the leadership cultivation practices of one elite school in Singapore. We point to the links between the habitus of the Singapore state and that of the school showing how different components of the school's leadership curriculum deploy the transnational in order to produce leaders for the nation. In essence, we argue that the school is involved in a form of tactical globalisation which matches neatly that of the state itself. We situate this study in the sociology of elite education with a view to contributing to two new lines of inquiry: the first about elite schools in Asia and the second about elite schools and globalisation. In so doing, we deploy a Bourdieusian perspective while also asking how successfully his concepts travel to the Singaporean context. The paper draws on a larger multinational, multi-sited ethnographic study of elite schools and globalisation. (Contains 6 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">The objective of this work is to reflect on unequal schooling opportunities in Brazil, focusing on certain characteristics that mark, nowadays, the schooling trajectories of young people from middle- and high-income families. Our previous researches showed that an important part of these families are increasingly investing in international resources, seen as a vital tool for their kids' success. This led to questions about the repercussion of this phenomenon in the strategies used by schools to fulfil parental demands. The research focuses on private schools in high-income neighbourhoods in Belo Horizonte. Interviews with school staff, an analysis on their website and other printed materials revealed that: (a) around half of the researched schools develop internationalisation initiatives such as: special programmes of foreign language learning; bilingual pedagogical projects; and trips abroad and (b) these initiatives could start in a precocious age (since kindergarten), especially foreign language learning.

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article points to international education in elementary and post-elementary schools as an emerging and promising field of enquiry. It describes the state of art of this new field and sets out the nature of the research. The rapid development of international networks in recent decades; the contribution of international education policies to the expansion of international education; the growing number of international students and its implications for school life; and the different meanings of international curriculum are the main topics in this literature. Issues of globalisation, social stratification, multiculturalism, identity formation, and the link between education and the nation state are closely related to international education. Scholars adapt classical theoretical frames and advance new concepts and methodologies in order to clarify this new phenomenon and highlight the deeper meanings of the expansion of international education. For this reason the study of international education has the potential of enhancing our sociological understanding concerning new developments in education in particular and in society in general.

    <str name="description">This paper presents some of the findings that emerged out of a national survey carried out in the school year 2005-2006 in various parts of Greece. The main aim of the study was to explore the effects of various &amp;quot;family&amp;quot; factors on the &amp;quot;student performance&amp;quot; in the (national) higher education entrance examinations. From the analysis of data it becomes evident that, despite numerous attempts at educational reform in the Greek education system in the last 30 years, inequalities among students based on family background still exist. The study has shown that the educational level and occupational status of parents represent two of the major factors affecting student performance--directly or indirectly--through their influence on previous achievement. It has also documented that the interplay between economic, cultural and social capital in shaping educational and occupational &amp;quot;pathways&amp;quot; is still an immensely important dimension in sociological studies of education.

    <str name="description">In this paper, I first examine how the dominant view of children as incompetent is constructed in the field of sociology, highlighting the constructions of them as playful, vulnerable and passive. Then, I deconstruct these dominant constructions and argue that they do not do children justice. To restore justice to children through reconstructing the concept of childhood, I suggest that children should neither be constructed as workfree and carefree, nor as innately innocent and vulnerable. Moreover, I suggest that the common practice of legally fixing a chronological identity for adults within the life course should be challenged, and that the relationship between social structures and agency should be understood in terms of relational rather than co-deterministic theories. Finally, to promote agency in children at the policy level, I suggest that they should be empowered to participate actively in various settings, particularly schools.</str>

    <str name="title">Revisiting Bourdieu: Alternative Educational Systems in the Light of the Theory of Social and Cultural Reproduction</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Azaola, Marta Cristina</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The paper reflects upon the principles and practice of an alternative educational system operating in rural Mexico in the light of Bourdieu's theory of cultural and social reproduction. Bourdieu's theory seeks to explain processes of reproduction of power relations within schools and society; whereas alternative educational systems seek to expand educational access in deprived areas in order to counteract processes of social inequality. The paper argues that, although Bourdieu's theory does not fully explain the gradual inclusion of more people from disadvantaged backgrounds into education through alternative educational systems, processes of social reproduction in deprived communities still occur mainly because of lack of state support after primary school level, and a shortage of better infrastructure and opportunities for this sector of the population. Since the widespread upward educational and class mobility of the rural poor has not yet been achieved, the paper concludes that the processes of cultural and social reproduction continue despite the introduction of alternative educational systems.</str>

    <str name="description">It is widely recognised that higher education is crucial for socio-economic growth in developing countries. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is lagging behind in this regard in spite of a strong expansion of universities in the last decades. However, this growth may have led to a deterioration of the quality of higher education. There is no dearth of recommendations how to improve this situation, but empirical studies about the concrete situation of tertiary education in SSA are largely missing. This study attempts to balance this dearth. A survey was carried out among 500 students of St Augustine University of Tanzania, the largest private institution of higher education in that country. Three topics were investigated: the social background of the students, their present socio-economic situation and the evaluation of the living and study conditions.

    <str name="description">The publication of &amp;quot;Trading in Futures&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;When Schools Compete&amp;quot; helped give empirical support to the view that choice policies increased differences between schools. However, dispute about this research and changes in policy mean that our understanding of the impact of school choice policies in New Zealand remains partial. This paper aims to address continued uncertainty about the impact of school choice policies in New Zealand. It presents the results of a study that drew upon qualitative data gathered in interviews with school principals and on administrative data on the enrolment patterns in the same competition space explored by the Trading in Futures research. The data show that periods of greatest instability in enrolments occurred around the time of change in regulations. (Contains 2 figures, 5 notes and 11 tables.)</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper's topic is the educational upward mobility of members of the working class. It seeks to find out what makes educational success possible and aims to build a theory of educational upward mobility. Data have been collected through biographical-narrative interviews of Austrian graduates from working-class backgrounds. Their narratives have been analysed abductively, by creating hypotheses from observation of empirical phenomena. As a result, the need for higher education for identity is revealed as a constitutive factor for educational upward mobility. Thus, members of the working class are educationally upwardly mobile when their identities are related to higher education. This finding might explain why policies which do not address fundamental societal and institutional changes often fail to increase the educational success of members of the working class.

    <str name="title">How Do Relationships Influence Student Achievement? Understanding Student Performance from a General, Social Psychological Standpoint</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Aspelin, Jonas</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores the influence of relationships on student achievement by examining empirical evidence and by adopting a social psychological theory. Initially, the issue is addressed from a national, Swedish context. Thereafter, two general questions are raised: (1) What is the influence of relationships on student achievement, according to empirical research? (2) How can the influence of relationships on student achievement be conceptualised? Question one is discussed from a body of international and Scandinavian research on general characteristics of teaching that promote student achievement. The argument leads to a model in which the teacher-student relationship is a key factor. In order to discuss the second question, Kenneth Gergen's social psychological theory is applied. According to the analysis, relationships play an essential role in understanding student achievement. The relational process is regarded as an inherent aspect of educational life and the foundation for encouraging performance. By combining these perspectives, the significance of relationships for comprehending student achievement is revealed. In the final section of this text, practical-pedagogical implications are discussed with reference to a narrative about a young student's knowledge development. (Contains 3 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Beck, John</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper examines three recent accounts of what has allegedly gone wrong with the school curriculum in England in recent years and their prescriptions for remedying these ills--all three accounts sharing strong proposals to reinstate &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot; at the heart of the curriculum. These analyses, despite some significant similarities, come from very different political standpoints. They are: first, proposals by the current UK Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove to &amp;quot;shrink&amp;quot; the National Curriculum whilst promoting a new English Baccalaureate; secondly Frank Furedi, Kathryn Ecclestone and Dennis Hayes' critiques of &amp;quot;therapeutic education&amp;quot; and thirdly Michael Young and Johan Muller's proposals, grounded in a social realist epistemology, for a &amp;quot;Future 3&amp;quot; curriculum which respects the objectivity of knowledge but also recognises its fallibility and openness to change. The paper concludes by suggesting that Michael Gove's basic objective is to shape what Basil Bernstein called a neoconservative prospective educational identity; the paper offers a critical assessment of this project and briefly considers an alternative approach, focusing on some issues relating to citizenship education.

    <str name="description">This paper analyses the educational attainment of Tajikistani adults born between 1947 and 1989. Adults in the oldest cohorts completed school during the educational expansion of the Soviet period and the youngest cohorts completed their education in the post-Soviet period, which was marked by educational contraction. To date, there is not a clear picture of attainment trends during the Soviet period that provide a perspective for judging educational attainment in the post-Soviet period. Using household survey data collected in 2007 by the World Bank, I conduct a synthetic cohort analysis to estimate the likelihood of completing basic, secondary and higher education for men and women; urban and rural residents and ethnic majority and minority citizens. Findings for particular groups are mixed, but in general the gap in educational attainment between advantaged groups and disadvantaged groups narrows during the Soviet era, but widens in the post-Soviet period.

    <str name="description">The white middle-class parents who chose to send their children to urban comprehensives largely rejected engaging in the usual competitiveness for educational success. Nevertheless the parents in our study still found themselves wittingly or otherwise captured by that same discourse. Their children are high achievers and are regarded as a valuable resource for their comprehensive schools generating high volume capital. However, in spite of this, the parents do not leave such success to chance. Drawing on an ESRC-funded research project (Educational Choices and the White Urban Middle-Classes RES-148-25-0023) we analyse how middle-class parental involvement is part of the age old process of social reproduction and the transmission of parents' middle-class privilege to their children, almost regardless of their intentions. Not only are the parents interventionist in their children's schooling, they draw on and dispose their own privileged capitals to prepare and position their children for educational success.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lourie, Megan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Maori language education policy documents reflect an underlying ambivalence about the desired outcomes for non-Maori learners participating in &amp;quot;as-a-subject&amp;quot; Maori language learning. The view of the Maori language as a national language may be in the process of being replaced by a view that identifies the language primarily as a cultural &amp;quot;taonga&amp;quot; (treasured possession) belonging to those of Maori ethnicity in the interests of an emergent elite. This is a process that characterises the &amp;quot;reframing of biculturalism&amp;quot;. Language, as a communally shared good, serves an important boundary marking function and can be employed as a demarcating feature of identity. Viewed in this way, the Maori language contributes to strengthening a Maori ethnic identity, which in turn secures access to group rights. These group rights were established when Maori tribes were reconstituted as economic corporations or neotribes in political partnership with the government in the 1980s. The increasing exclusion of non-Maori from the Maori language may result in their rejection of biculturalism. (Contains 11 notes.)</str>

      <str>Torres, Carlos Alberto</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Neoliberalism has utterly failed as a viable model of economic development, yet the politics of culture associated with neoliberalism is still in force, becoming the new common sense shaping the role of government and education. This "common sense" has become an ideology playing a major role in constructing hegemony as moral and intellectual leadership in contemporary societies. Neoliberal globalisation, predicated on the dominance of the market over the state and on deregulatory models of governance, has deeply affected the university in the context of "academic capitalism". The resulting reforms, rationalised as advancing international competitiveness, have affected public universities in four primary areas: efficiency and accountability, accreditation and universalisation, international competitiveness and privatisation. There is also growing resistance to globalisation as top-down-imposed reforms reflected in the public debates about schooling reform, curriculum and instruction, teacher training and school governance. Many question whether neoliberal reforms attempt to limit the effectiveness of universities as sites of contestation of the national and global order and thus undermine the broader goals of education. Neoliberal reforms have limited access and opportunity along class and racial lines, including limiting access to higher education through the imposition of higher tuition and reduced government support to institutions and individuals.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Verger, Antoni</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) of the World Trade Organization has generated an intense and passionate debate about the relationship between free-trade and education and, specifically, about the effects of trade liberalization in national education systems. This article explores in detail this debate from a critical discourse and semiotic approach. Its objective is two-fold. First, it aims at identifying and systematizing the core axes of the debate, as well as at confronting ideas within each of the axes. Second, it aims at explaining how and why the agreement has generated such an intense and polarized discussion in the educational field by, among other analytical strategies, appealing to the broader institutional and ideational contexts in which the debate is inscribed. Arguments are based on observation in public debates on GATS and education and a corpus of 86 texts on the topic coming from different sources including academic journals, conference proceedings, policy reports and newsletters of international and civil society organizations.

    <str name="description">This article takes its point of departure in the current tendency of education policy to become more and more evidence-based. The use of statistics and numbers seems to be a prerequisite for conducting a policy that is both efficient and effective. The kind of knowledge thus produced is regarded as factual and scientific. This article tries to get a grasp on value-added modelling, a commonly used method supposed to produce such knowledge. Drawing on some conceptual underpinnings of actor-network theory, the article advances that such factual matters often take the form of matters of educational performance that are shaped and produced by means of calculative and inscription devices. However, the adagio that measures of performances should guide education policy is only one, albeit strong, point of view. Taking not only performances but also public issues into account could lead to what could be called a more "concern-oriented" policy. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    <str name="description">The study analyses the extent to which the sociological message transmitted by the Official Pedagogic Discourse of the curriculum for Portuguese middle schools contains the ideological and pedagogical principles of its authors. The research is epistemologically and sociologically grounded, placing particular emphasis on Bernstein theory of pedagogic discourse. The ideological principles underlie broad educational aims and the pedagogical principles underlie characteristics of the pedagogic practice. Data was obtained through a semi-structured interview with the authors and documental analysis of their publications. The results suggest that the authors were distinct in the ideological and pedagogical principles they valued and that discontinuities were evident between those principles and the curriculum message. These results are discussed and their consequences in terms of scientific learning are explored. (Contains 1 figure, 1 table, and 12 notes.)</str>

    <str name="title">The International Baccalaureate and "Growth Scepticism": A "Social Limits" Framework</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Bunnell, Tristan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The number of schools offering the programmes of the International Baccalaureate (IB) hit 3000 in July 2010. Since 2004 the IB has aimed for further growth within a "wider access" and "greater impact" paradigm. A "further" 7000 schools are expected to be involved by 2020. However, there is now considerable concern about growth, especially within the "international school movement" who see it as compromising quality. This recent phenomenon can be termed "growth scepticism" in the same way economic growth is now questioned as desirable. This paper charts this development and argues there is room for a much wider framework of analysis, viewing the global growth of the IB within a social and moral lens. This paper takes the economist Fred Hirsch's 1976 book "The social limits to growth" as its core theoretical framework, linking growth to potential social externalities such as increased competition and the commercialization of society.</str>

    <str name="title">Emotionally-Vulnerable Subjects and New Inequalities: The Educational Implications of an &amp;quot;Epistemology of the Emotions&amp;quot;</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Ecclestone, Kathryn</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Motivated by very different goals, various interest groups argue that the British government should address problems with citizens' emotional well-being. Concerns about emotional vulnerability and poor emotional well-being amongst growing numbers of children, young people and adults produce ideas and approaches from different branches of psychology and psychoanalysis. These compete for legitimacy throughout the education system. In part, such developments can be seen as the latest manifestation of a long-running tendency to psychologise intractable educational and social problems. The roots of the psychologisation of emotional vulnerability also lie in a deeper philosophical and political disenchantment with an externally-seeking, autonomous human subject and forms of curriculum knowledge that support it. One effect of these related trends is an epistemology of the emotion that privileges an emotionally vulnerable identity as integral to contemporary human subjectivity. One outcome is to offer emotionally-focused pedagogy and knowledge, particularly for those deemed to be educationally and socially disadvantaged. The paper argues that, despite being highly unfashionable in sociological, political and philosophical theory, a humanist view of subjectivity challenges the new inequalities and diminished forms of pedagogy and knowledge this epistemology offers.

    <str name="description">The article analyses the main benefits of a Portuguese programme, launched in 1996, which was designed to support schools in segregated districts (TEIPs). The first part of the article presents a theoretical framework, before moving on to the main features of the TEIP programme in contemporary Portuguese society and education. An explanation of the methodological procedures applied in the research is also included. In the second part of the article, the main results are discussed. In broad terms, the programme succeeded in reducing violence patterns and drop-out rates. On the other hand, an improvement in academic outcomes is slow and the links to local communities and the labour market are variable and, in both cases, highly dependent of local variables. In the conclusion, the authors systematise the opportunities and challenges of such a &amp;quot;territorial approach&amp;quot; and point out some key factors in enhancing its success.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines the theoretical perspectives I utilised in my doctoral research to uncover the role of class and gender in my respondents' stories and experiences of their career success. I argue that adopting an economic model for conceptualising the influence of social class and gender in the respondents' stories and experiences of their career success is inadequate because it has historically neglected to take account of women's position in the labour market. Drawing on an example from my data examining the influence of the respondents' familial attitudes and dispositions towards education, the paper contends that Bourdieu's concept of habitus is an invaluable tool for theorising senior female academics' pathways to career success by bringing together a cultural, social and economic understanding of social class and gender.

    <str name="description">This study aims to contribute to the fields of sociology of education and Canadian sociological teaching. English and French Canadian sociology of education course outlines were systematically analysed in order to assess how national context, language and internal divisions influence the undergraduate teaching of sociology of education. The findings indicate that: (1) identity and national questions are solely discussed in French Canada, (2) English Canada is experiencing a split between mainstream and critical approaches and (3) required readings parallel the national linguistic divide between English and French. In addition, there is no consensual &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; for Canadian sociology of education curriculum and inequality is the most covered topic in the field. Mutual intellectual exchange between English and French sociologists, a relevant discussion about a core in the field and a better integration of under taught topics are proposed to move forward. The implications and significance of these findings are also discussed. (Contains 3 tables.)</str>

    <str name="description">This paper presents a critical analysis of the transnational interplay of cultural, educational and economic forces that culminated with the establishment of a Chinese language and cultural centre in Peru, the Confucius Institute. Confucius Institutes are government-sponsored cultural centres devoted mainly to Chinese language education around the world. They have been referred to as examples of China's soft power and subjected to criticisms. With a substantive theory of power as the departure point, this article analyses the power relations surrounding the case of Confucius Institutes in Latin America.</str>

    <str name="title">Genders and Sexualities: Exploring the Conceptual Limits of Contemporary Educational Research</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Haywood, Chris</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Over the past three decades educational research has provided an exciting and dynamic theoretical engagement with gender and sexuality. While acknowledging this contribution, this article is a conceptually-led exploration of a number of theoretical and methodological tensions contained within this research. More specifically, it argues that current research is limiting the possibilities of new knowledge by insisting on particular epistemological, methodological and theoretical positions. It argues that, in the spirit of Bachelard (2002), the research community needs to pursue epistemological breaks in order to recalibrate their theoretical and methodological positions. More specifically, this article suggests that a current dependence on sexuality identity categories, the positioning of the body as central to methodology and a reliance on particular theories of gender restrict the possibilities for new knowledge and understanding in the field.</str>

    <str name="description">The era of New Labour government has witnessed unprecedented growth in inclusive education policies. There is, however, limited evidence that policies have increased disabled children's inclusion. This article explores reasons for this contradiction. Drawing on sociological insights, it is argued that New Labour policies on inclusive education take their cues from wider neo-liberal constructions of social exclusion; ideas that point to the personal deficits of the excluded rather than social barriers and inequalities that systematically exclude. Increasingly narrow definitions of educational success are likely to add to this exclusion. This mirrors New Labour's broader social inclusion agenda in emphasising &amp;quot;conditional&amp;quot; inclusion and an increasingly utilitarian approach to social policy. New Labour, it is argued, needs to review the lessons of history in reducing disabled children's educational exclusion if real progress is to be made. Warnock's recent attack on the principle of inclusive education makes this review all the more urgent. (Contains 2 tables.)</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">Schools are a stabilising feature in the unsettled lives of refugee students. They provide safe spaces for new encounters, interactions and learning opportunities. They also deliver literacy, the key to educational success, post-school options, life choices, social participation and settlement. Currently Australian schools are poorly funded and ill-equipped to provide effective English as a Second Language teaching and support. A new cohort of refugee students mainly from Africa and the Middle East are struggling. This article discusses the importance of educational interventions that keep in mind both the immediacy of &amp;quot;what is happening now&amp;quot; and broader post-colonial conditions. It identifies the limits of piecemeal partnership interventions and the domination of psychological approaches that individualise the issues and overemphasise pre-displacement conditions of trauma. Such approaches disregard the socio-political conditions of post-displacement and issues of racialisation, acculturation and resilience. The article argues for good practice approaches to schooling and settlement that involve whole-school accounting for organisational processes and structures, policy, procedure, pedagogy and curricula.

    <str name="description">The successful inclusion of minority ethnic pupils with sickle cell disorders (SCD) raises a number of challenges for educational systems. In England, local education authorities were important drivers for innovative responses to complex needs and the former Inner London Education Authority produced guidance in 1989 on SCD in schools. Local education authorities, however, have been superseded by centralised curricula on the one hand and by local management of schools on the other. We know little about the impact of these changes on managing chronic conditions such as SCD. A survey was conducted with 107 local authorities in England to assess responses to needs of pupils with SCD. The majority of authorities did not know the numbers of children with SCD under their jurisdiction, even though most agreed with government guidance that all such children should have individual healthcare plans. Only two had policies on SCD and most authorities referred to generic guidance on pupils with medical needs in schools. The paper concludes, however, that such generic guidance fails in a number of ways to meet the needs of young people with SCD, in terms of prevention, challenging disability discrimination and, crucially, in failing to recognise how ethnicity and racism mediate the experiences of young black disabled students. Developing policies suitable for the education needs of young people with SCD would also help develop the very narrow guidance currently suggested for inclusion of pupils with medical conditions.

    <str name="description">This paper examines the inexorable rise of "health" as regulative discourse, highlighting its class and cultural dimensions. With reference to the policy content of recent obesity reports, analysis suggests that contemporary concerns around obesity are but a modern variant of earlier eighteenth and nineteenth century child saving crusades whose primary concerns were the regulation of deviant populations among women and the working classes rather than amelioration of the antecedents of social disorder and its attendant ill-health. Unlike earlier crusades, however, in the "risk" discourse of contemporary versions, class and gender are but a subtle presence, while other subjectivities of ethnicity, age and disability are barely to be seen. We suggest that in failing to address the complexity of people's lives and the intersections of class and culture, such policies and their attendant pedagogies are likely to have very little impact on either individual or community health.

    <str name="description">Published in London between 1839 and 1852 and aligned with the commercial objectives of the New Zealand Company, the &amp;quot;New Zealand Journal&amp;quot; included letters from emigrants. This paper studies letters written by a small cohort of rural labourers who emigrated from Ham House in Surrey to Wellington in 1841. Following Dorothy Smith, I read them as ethnographic data, interrogating them in relation to ruling-class texts including Company records, newspaper reports and correspondence between capitalists, professionals and politicians. The labourers' letters depict capital-labour (class) and colonial (race) relations in embodied form. The everyday actualities of their activities were co-ordinated by extra-local social relations of colonialism and flows of capital and labour. Their schooling in England had been designed to &amp;quot;keep them in their place&amp;quot;. With reference to the sparse archival resources remaining from the first years of commercially-driven settlement, before there was an apparatus of state, I consider how changing material conditions in the settlement enabled and constrained learning opportunities for these labourers' children.</str>

    <str name="description">Researching the intersection of class, race, gender, sexuality and disability raises many issues for educational research. Indeed, Maynard (2002, 33) has recently argued that &amp;quot;difference is one of the most significant, yet unresolved, issues for feminist and social thinking at the beginning of the twentieth century&amp;quot;. This paper reviews some of the key imperatives of working with &amp;quot;intersectional theory&amp;quot; and explores the extent to these debates are informing research around difference in education and Physical Education (PE). The first part of the paper highlights some key issues in theorising and researching intersectionality before moving on to consider how difference has been addressed within PE. The paper then considers three ongoing challenges of intersectionality--bodies and embodiment, politics and practice and empirical research. The paper argues for a continued focus on the specific context of PE within education for its contribution to these questions. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    <str name="title">Learning Difficulties and Social Class: Exploring the Intersection through Family Narratives</str>

      <str>Nind, Melanie</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article is concerned with the intersection between learning difficulties and social class. It also inevitably tells of the gender-class interface in relation to women's caring roles. I use the life story narratives of three mothers and a grandmother of a person with learning difficulties, together with concepts from Bourdieu, to explore the ways in which class-related capital and habitus affect their life experiences and their interactions with educational and other professionals. The data are the stories of (grand)mothers reflecting on life events, particularly in relation to decision making surrounding education, while simultaneously providing subtle, rich pictures of their socio-economic contexts. I illustrate how privilege and disadvantage are reproduced partly for the families through their institutional interactions, which are differentiated according to economic and social resources. The stories re-presented in this paper provide powerful examples of how experiences of living with learning difficulties and disabilities are situated in one's class position and how struggles for inclusion are at once common and particular.</str>

    <str name="title">Beyond Special and Regular Schooling? An Inclusive Education Reform Agenda</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Slee, Roger</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Following Edward Said's (2001) observations on traveling theories this paper considers the origins of inclusive education as a field of education research and policy that is in jeopardy of being undermined by its broadening popularity, institutional adoption and subsequent adaptations. Schools were not an invention for all and subsequently the struggle with demands for broadening participation is more profound than is widely acknowledged. The institutional separation of &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; schooling constructs pupils as cases for regular or special treatment and in doing so makes inclusion contingent upon satisfactory diagnosis of student defects and the deployment of resources that are more frequently structured for containment than for the building of school capacity to engage with difference. Tentatively this paper suggests that rather than lapse into established conversations about inclusive schooling as an accord between special and regular schooling, it may be more appropriate to consider &amp;quot;irregular schooling&amp;quot; as more historically appropriate.</str>

    <str name="description">This article explores the experiences of widening access students at two prestigious universities in Scotland. It is based on interview data collected from a small sample of young and mature students who had all attended a widening access course prior to coming to university. The analysis centres on the students' construction of themselves as &amp;quot;day students&amp;quot;, who live at home and combine studying with commitments to family or to paid employment. While they see being day students as a pragmatic response to their financial and material circumstances, it is argued that this disadvantages the students within the university system, both through their limited ability to participate in the wider social aspects of student life and through their exclusion from networks through which important information circulates.

    <str name="title">Changing Times in the Classroom: Teaching as a &amp;quot;Crowded Profession&amp;quot;</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Crump, Stephen</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article reports on a study of teachers in New South Wales (Australia) and their practices surrounding outcomes assessment and reporting, which took place in 2003 and 2004 as a follow-up to a major study in 1995. The study explored whether the main focus of a teacher's work involves planning, teaching, assessing, rewarding and sharing in their classroom and with colleagues, and whether this focus suffered many distractions in the flurry of reforms of the past decade. One example of &amp;quot;changing times&amp;quot; in the classroom has been the devolution of school management, which caused a number of diversions of energy and time away from teaching and learning. Yet even in the area of curriculum schools were struggling with a range of issues, many brought on by the advent of outcomes-based curricula. In seeking to change what happens in schools, teachers argued that they needed clear and well-argued reasons to change. This article thus provides an update on the relevant research, beginning with national and international experiences, before a discussion of workload, the place of parents and school organizational effects. One finding is that alongside a &amp;quot;crowded curriculum&amp;quot;, teaching has become a &amp;quot;crowded profession&amp;quot;. The article concludes with reflections on how changing times in the classroom mean social reform as well as educational reform, in which teaching and learning shape effects and consequences from educational events so that knowledge grows through experiences, measuring possibilities not outcomes.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Devine, Dympna</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Much of the research in the area of ethnicity and schooling is conducted in countries with a long tradition of immigration. The rapidity of social change in Ireland at a time of unprecedented economic growth is such that many schools, while still &amp;quot;mainly white&amp;quot;, are grappling with the particular challenges that are posed by new patterns of immigration. How these schools, and indeed the state, adapts to this changed social context has important implications for the transition of Irish society to a more multicultural state, which values and respects cultural and ethnic diversity in all its forms. This article considers these issues by exploring the responses of a sample of teachers to immigrant students in their schools. Central to the analysis is the role of the state through its action or inaction, in framing teacher discourses in inclusionary or exclusionary terms. State policies, it is argued, are underpinned by a particular conceptualisation of Irish and national identity which positions minority ethnic groups as &amp;quot;other&amp;quot;, with direct implications for both teacher perception and practice with immigrant students in schools.

    <str name="description">Under neo-liberal modes of governance, new forms of partnership are emerging. This article begins by looking at the notion of partnership and the dominant model of partnership operating under New Labour in the United Kingdom, through a discussion of two cases of partnership working. I argue that the dominant model of partnership is primarily concerned with promoting the modernising agenda, and is instrumentalist and economically driven. As a result, the potential for partnership, in terms of democratic renewal and participation, cannot be realised. In the final section I argue that we need to conceptualise partnerships as learning partnerships, through which collaborative working could provide opportunities and spaces to resist the narrow instrumentalism of the neo-liberal agenda.

    <str name="title">Explorations in Teaching and Learning: A Biographical Narrative and Some Enduring Issues</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Pollard, Andrew</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article takes a broad, and somewhat personal, sweep across the last 30 years or so of educational history in the United Kingdom (UK)and highlights some of the challenges concerning research, policy and practice on teaching and learning which developed over the period. Issues associated with academic agency are considered and a narrative of the author's academic biography, particularly associated with primary education, is used to illustrate some of the dilemmas posed. The author's role as director of the Teaching and Learning Research Programme of the Economic and Social Research Council, the UK's largest contemporary investment in educational research, provides a particular context for this discussion. The article concludes that teaching and learning are always in &amp;quot;changing times&amp;quot;, but argues that many of the underlying issues are more enduring. It illustrates how history and biography shape the development of ideas, and how they pose questions and challenges for researchers at particular historic and biographical moments. The importance of cumulative synthesis of knowledge about key enduring issues, as generated through the biographies of each generation of researchers, is suggested. (Contains 2 figures.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Demaine, Jack</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The British Labour Party has continued to make progress on education, following two broad policy paths and adopting a pragmatic approach that does not attempt to force these to cross or converge. One path is that of the quasi market inherited from the previous Conservative administration; the other is characterised as &amp;quot;intervention&amp;quot; to support those for whom the market remains almost entirely irrelevant. Some observers regard this dual approach as &amp;quot;opportunism&amp;quot; and Labour's education policy as a &amp;quot;betrayal&amp;quot; of principle, by which is meant the principle of &amp;quot;equal opportunity&amp;quot;. Of course, that principle provides equal opportunity to fail as much as to succeed. Rather than leaving education to the market, Labour has focused on the needs of those most likely to be failed by the principle of &amp;quot;equal&amp;quot; opportunity in a quasi market.

    <str name="description">Despite burgeoning interests in &amp;quot;the body&amp;quot; as a topic of sociological interest and analysis in recent decades, with few notable exceptions, the sociology of education has not taken as seriously as it might how &amp;quot;embodied subjectivities&amp;quot; both shape and are framed by contexts of teaching and learning. There are processes of formal education that may either damage, or richly reward and sustain individual identities, by culture and class. This article suggests that embracing issues of corporeality in analyses of schooling may help us to better understand not only the complexity and importance of &amp;quot;emotions&amp;quot; (or rather the affective dimensions of corporeality) in teaching and learning, but also the immense &amp;quot;risks&amp;quot; involved, for some children, in displaying them when cultures of &amp;quot;performativity&amp;quot; dominate and prevail in schools. Our analysis highlights ways in which powerful discursive tendencies around body perfection, health and performance permeate schools, and influence how and what teachers and pupils think and learn about their identity and self-worth. Informed by data drawn from an ongoing study of the relationships between education, eating disorders and &amp;quot;obesity discourse&amp;quot;, our analyses illustrate the complexity of such processes, while also highlighting the merits of embracing &amp;quot;embodiment&amp;quot; in theories of learning, teaching, social reproduction and change.</str>

    <str name="title">Theorising the Mundane: The Significance of Agency</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Clegg, Sue</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In this article I argue that qualitative research that focuses attention on how change is being understood and experienced on the ground can contribute to broader theoretical insights. In recent research I have been exploring how lecturers apply their understandings of learning outcomes and personal development planning. At one level, these practices are mundane, yet they are subject to increased regulation, policy debate and scrutiny. In understanding macro-level changes, as well as deconstructing policy rhetoric, we need theoretical work that pays attention to the exercise of agency at the micro-level. The article presents a critical realist analysis of the significance of agency as developed by Margaret Archer. The argument for the importance of detailed analysis of mundane practices is then elaborated in the analysis of specific examples. The conclusions are not based on privileging a particular method. Rather, I argue that, in theorising about teaching and learning, and change in higher education, we need a clear focus on agency as the impact of macro-level changes are mediated through the understandings of specific actors, and their creativity and resistance.</str>

    <str name="title">Socially Just Pedagogies in Changing Times</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lingard, Bob</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article reports on Australian research that developed the concept of &amp;quot;productive pedagogies&amp;quot;, a model that is deemed to be socially just and appropriate for the contemporary post-modern globalised world. The model extends the modernist one of &amp;quot;authentic pedagogy&amp;quot; developed in the USA and sits as a counter to the inauthentic post-modernist model of pedagogy framed by neo-liberal and new public management forms of accountability in some educational systems. The article begins from the assumption that the quality of pedagogies is a social justice issue and documents the lack of intellectual demand, connectedness and working with difference in the pedagogies mapped in the 1000 classrooms observed, while also noting the high degree of social support teachers offered students. These lacks can be seen to reproduce inequalities through schooling, rather than challenge them. Teacher care and support are necessary, but not sufficient for socially just pedagogies, which also need to be backed by redistributive socially just policies and some professional trust of teachers.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Moore, Alex</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">With reference to Bernstein's theories concerning the pulls and tensions of competing pedagogic identities, this article draws on original research to suggest that a culture of pragmatism may be currently rooting itself in English schools. This culture is understood partly as an instrumental response to rapid and extensive educational reform, and partly as the internalization of a wider discourse of pragmatism in which pragmatism itself is conceived of as a virtue and takes on ideological significance. In addition to identifying a problematic relationship between the instrumental-pragmatic responses of head teachers and those of classroom teachers, the article considers the potential of &amp;quot;ideological pragmatism&amp;quot; to act as a hidden context within which instrumental pragmatism may lead to the lasting demotion of teachers' and head teachers' core pedagogic values.</str>

    <str name="description">It is widely acknowledged that there are important ties among pupils, parents and schools affecting children's educational outcome. Using NELS: 88, a nationally representative sample of eighth graders in the United States, this study explores the role of schools in their academic performance. The study suggests that, with other things equal, "school ambiance" has a significant and positive effect on mathematics and reading test scores of pupils. "School outreach" shows a positive and significant effect on mathematics achievement as well, but not on the pupils' reading test scores. "Parental involvement" initiated mainly by the parents does not show a significant result. (Contains 3 tables and 5 notes.)</str>

    <str name="title">A Critical Evaluation of Education Reforms in Hong Kong: Counting Our Losses to Economic Globalisation</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Choi, Po-King</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Not long after the political transition in 1997, Hong Kong witnessed a spate of top-down education reforms that had been conceived within the neoliberal ideology of economic globalisation. Neoliberalism is particularly pervasive here, because of the underdevelopment of representative politics and of critical, social democratic discourse in society. This article examines how education has been shortchanged by these reforms that dovetail with various processes arising from neoliberalism. These processes include privatisation, managerialism and performativity within the schools, as well as standardisation and surveillance in the curriculum. While teachers experience subjection to a new form of governmental discipline, society as a whole suffers from increasing polarisation in education provision. The reinvention of a humanist education agenda is urgently called for but, unfortunately, this is fraught with great difficulties. (Contains 9 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Hill, Dave</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article examines some impacts of neoliberal education policies during the current period of the intensification of neoliberal capital. Section 1 examines the relationship between education and capital, identifying three plans capital has in relation to education. It sets out some of the major aspects of neoliberal policy developments in schooling and further education. Section 2 describes, analyses and evaluates the research methodology used in developing this article, locating the methodology within the debate between &amp;quot;methodological purists&amp;quot; on the one hand, and &amp;quot;committed research&amp;quot; on the other. The research for this article, within the &amp;quot;research for social justice&amp;quot; paradigm, is rationalised. Section 3 examines the impacts of neoliberalisation on education workers' securities--their pay/salaries, conditions of employment, stresses and pressures at work, and their work identity and status. It also examines the impacts on the rights and powers of education trade unions. The article ends, in Section 4, by briefly calling for resistance to the global neoliberal capitalist agenda in schooling and education. (Contains 20 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Zavala, Blanca Arciga</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">For more than ten years, academics of public universities in Mexico have endured modernization programs that promote individual productivity and operate as a mechanism of selection and assessment. The implementation of the programs has exposed a tension between the values implicit in the programs and the values of the academic teachers. There is a discrepancy between the current emphasis on the economic and productive role of the academics, and their teaching as a cultural and social practice. This article examines the tensions and the discrepancy through the accounts of some academics from one public university in Mexico who have experienced the modernization programs at first hand.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Bernard, Julie</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Research conducted by Patrick Clancy and by Fitzpatrick Associates and Philip O'Connell on the level of representation of socio-economic groups amongst higher education entrants has been a key element in the development of access policy and practice in Ireland. This article reviews the context for the development of access and explores the relationship between this research and access policy and practice. The research dominated access discourses and it is suggested that a risk of a reliance on such research is that it is seen as unproblematic and that categorical approaches are viewed as the only approach with which to conceptualise the relationship between disadvantage, social class and access to higher education.

    <str name="title">The Everyday Classificatory Practices of Selective Schooling: A Fifty-Year Retrospective</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Brine, Jacky</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The fifty-year retrospective has led to recent media interest in the comprehensive school. Bristol, located in the south-west of England, is frequently portrayed as an early provider. This article draws on documentary evidence and life-history interviews with ex-pupils to explore this claim. It finds that they were not comprehensive schools, but &amp;quot;selective bilaterals&amp;quot; that, despite including grammar and secondary modern &amp;quot;streams&amp;quot; within the same physical site, constructed, through their curricular and non-curricular practices, a rigid divide between the two. The selective schooling of the bilateral consolidated the classificatory practices that began in primary school. Framed by Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, disposition and classificatory practices, it is a study of explicit &amp;quot;selective&amp;quot; schooling that was reliant not only on key moments of selection, and differentiated curricula, but on everyday practices and signifiers of difference.

    <str name="description">This article focuses on the construction of dyslexia in higher education and explores the nature of negotiations between students, lecturers and academic institutions over diagnosis, support and assessment. Disabled students are now entitled, under the terms of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA), to reasonable adjustments in assessment. However, there continue to be debates about the nature of dyslexia and the extent to which requests for reasonable adjustments threaten to compromise academic standards. The article begins with a brief overview of the provisions of the DDA and its implications for learning support and adjustments to assessment in higher education, before considering current debates in education over the nature of dyslexia and its implications for assessment in higher education. We then consider the incidence of dyslexia in higher education and the implications of the rapid growth in the number and proportion of disabled students in higher education for assessment practices. Subsequently, we present case studies of dyslexic students and discuss (a) the way in which dyslexia is understood by different actors and (b) institutional responses to claims for reasonable adjustment in teaching and assessment.

    <str name="description">This paper adopts a social constructionist position on assessment, specifically that it can never be free of the social conditions in which it is practiced. As such, we explore two aspects of classroom interactions which contribute to and shape the learning environments in which assessment takes place. By drawing on interviews carried out with 51 teachers and 307 Year 3 (7-8-year-old) pupils the paper demonstrates where and how beliefs and attitudes about gender influence what they perceived as &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;appropriate&amp;quot; working relationships. It also considers the ways in which teachers utilize perceptions of gender to plan the curriculum and manage their classrooms. Whilst the pupils believed their teachers treated them in a fair and just manner, three quarters of the teachers interviewed believed they did or should respond differently to pupils according to gender. We argue that the emphasis given to boys' underachievement has contributed to this scenario. (Contains 4 tables and 3 notes.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Krajnc, Marina Tavcar</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article examines the introduction of the final examination as an external national system of assessment of students in the transition from secondary school to university education. Since 1991 Slovenia has followed foreign models, the British one in particular; however, it has also considered its own traditional system of education. Students take the final examination (the matura) in three compulsory and two elective subjects; of which sociology can be one. A case study considering this subject demonstrates how external assessment can be fine tuned using internally supervised and assessed project work, in which seminar essays are produced. This article conducts a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the essays and structured questions forming the written examination; the same procedure is applied in the case of seminar essays. Also included are the opinions and experiences of students regarding their preparations for the final examination and their work in the seminars; the students' feedback is decidedly positive. So far, the external and the internal results have shown little correlation, a fact that points to certain problems in the final examination assessment system. The positive results in sociology, considered in this contribution, suggest that it would be worthwhile applying similar assessment strategies in other subjects. It is, however, impossible to provide a straightforward answer to the question of a positive impact of the final examination on the desired improvement in the quality of the education process.

    <str name="description">The latent power of social work's position at the centre of welfare services and as a coordinator and definer of social realities can be argued to have led social work to become &amp;quot;the assessment profession&amp;quot;. Building upon a critique of the key distinction between &amp;quot;description and prescription&amp;quot;, we argue that the conceptualization of assessment needs to be enriched to understand its influence across the different domains of professional education and professional practice in social work. Key perspectives are drawn from the work of two contrasting theorists: the critical social theory of Habermas and the psychological constructivism of George Kelly. Arguments are developed towards a new approach of conducive assessment in social work. (Contains 6 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">This paper presents a study of dominant educational discourses through textual critique and argues that such an approach enables education studies to preserve an important distinction from teacher training. The texts deconstructed here are specific to English education, but the discourses at work have international relevance as the rhetorics of accountability, performance and measurement (which we call cells of discourse) have global reach. Ward described a national picture in England whereby the great majority, if not all, of education studies undergraduate courses appear to be taught alongside, or within (through shared modules) teacher training programmes. But from a sociological position, these are two increasingly conflicting arenas--the study of education and the training of teachers. In response, Ward called for the subject to radicalize teacher education. The implications of this are significant if education studies is to retain a status as agent of critique. In this paper we return to the theme of education studies as a discrete practice from teacher training and suggest that any acceptance of a proximal relation to teacher education is counter-productive. In so doing we offer three contemporary examples of the subject at deconstructive work, scrutinizing the published standards for teacher training in England, employer discourse and the Tomlinson report (commissioned by the English government to offer proposals for the reworking of vocational education) and the new curriculum for adult literacy in England. Particular attention is given to analysing the ways in which such texts speak the currently powerful discourse of standards. (Contains 3 figures.)</str>

    <str name="description">Drawing on the Queensland School Reform Longitudinal Study (QSRLS), this paper documents the assessment practices of about 250 Queensland primary and secondary classrooms and the extent to which they align with those pedagogical practices described as &amp;quot;productive pedagogies&amp;quot; in the research. In considering the extent of this alignment, the paper outlines in some detail the concept of &amp;quot;productive assessment&amp;quot;, which also developed out of the research. The QSRLS demonstrated the necessity of aligning pedagogies and assessment practices with curriculum purposes to enhance student learning and contribute to socially just outcomes. A lack of visible alignment in the assessment practices of teachers in the study is demonstrated and discussed. When considered in conjunction with the low intellectual demands of the pedagogies observed, there are serious social justice implications to be drawn from the research. The paper also shows the significance of systemic assessment policies in relation to teacher assessment practices. The paper conceptualizes &amp;quot;productive assessment&amp;quot; in relation to broader sociological considerations of assessment practices. Some possible explanations for the findings are proffered and some brief recommendations about a way forward in relation to teacher professional development around assessment literacy are suggested.

      <str>Phtiaka, Helen</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The paper examines parental views regarding the implementation of Educational Legislation 113(I)/99 in Cyprus regarding the integration of children with special needs in the mainstream school. It is based on parental interviews which were taken in the course of a large research project regarding the implementation of the new legislation in primary and pre-primary education. Parental views are presented in thematic categories and commented upon. Direct quotations from the interviews are used to illustrate the point made. It appears that parents on the whole feel that although the situation is much better now than it used to be before the introduction of the new legislation, a number of serious problems are still faced by the children and their families, some of which are not dissimilar to those existing before the passing of Law 113(I)/99. The paper finishes with specific suggestions about how some of these problems can be solved. (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    <str name="title">Education and the Politics of Selection: Radical Policies for Those Set to Fail in the Twenty-First Century?</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Demaine, Jack</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper is concerned with the longstanding question of policy for those referred to nearly half a century ago by the Crowther Report as the &amp;quot;bottom half&amp;quot;; those mainly working class children who, in a sense, are &amp;quot;selected for failure&amp;quot;. The issue of selection is a matter of concern in countries around the world and has been at the centre of renewed political debate in Britain during 2005-2006. Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair has been keen to advance a policy of &amp;quot;freeing-up&amp;quot; secondary schools so as to provide &amp;quot;diversity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;more choice for parents and pupils&amp;quot;. Critics regard such a policy as involving &amp;quot;selection by other means&amp;quot;. This paper discusses questions of social class and inequality that are bound-up with the issue of selection. The paper provides an account of &amp;quot;Blairite&amp;quot; New Labour policy and discusses its closeness to new right education policy. The paper concludes with a discussion of radical proposals and observations on the prospects for the future. (Contains 9 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">For several decades, the Maltese educational system was almost entirely reliant on English examination boards for certification in secondary and post-secondary education. In the 1990s, Maltese policy-makers decided to establish an affordable local examination system aimed at a wide range of students. This paper focuses on the review of the Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) examination introduced in 1994 and intended to attract 80% of the 16-year-old cohort. Although its main aim was certification of individual competence, and its underlying philosophy and approach were non-selective in nature, the SEC examination introduced a number of features that unintentionally led to selectivity. These include the system of differentiated papers, the language policy of the examination papers, the perceived need of private tuition to reach the required standard and the introduction of a September re-sit session. These issues are discussed with a view to explore how selectivity is involved in all of them and whether it can be avoided. The relevant recommendations of the review are later discussed in order to evaluate how these issues of selectivity have been addressed. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper is organized around a single interview with an academic colleague who was asked to reflect on his changing experience of Ph.D. supervision. Material from the interview is used to raise some questions about the nature of responsible supervision in the humanities and social sciences, and the ways in which the possibilities for responsible supervision in the UK are constructed by the effects of the audit culture in higher education (HE). Specifically, the interview is used to examine and illustrate concerns about the implications of the audit culture for the quality of doctoral work, for equity in students' access to and experience of doctoral study, for the autonomy of students and supervisors and for the nature of academic professionalism. In conclusion, it is argued that whatever procedures are in place to regulate student-supervisor relationships, there will inevitably be benefits and costs in terms of quality and equity: the challenges are to find forms of accountability that are less costly and for those with an interest in responsible supervision to be sensitive to the many ways in which quality and equity can be put at risk by well-intentioned procedures.

    <str name="description">An indifference to the affective domain and an allegiance to the education of the rational autonomous subject and public citizen are at the heart of formal education. The impact of Cartesian rationalism is intensifying with the glorification of performativity measured by league tables and rankings. The citizen carer and the care recipient citizen are only recognized in the educational arena when professionals are being trained to manage those in need of care. Education for informal care labor, solidarity work and love labor is generally not part of the formal educational trajectory. Because the scholarly understanding of work has been equated with economic self preservation and self-actualization through interaction with nature, education is seen as preparation for this type of work. Education is indifferent to other-centered work arising from our interdependencies and dependencies as affective, relational beings. In particular it has ignored the centrality of nurturing for the preservation and self-actualization of the human species. In this article the authors argue that sociologists need to engage with the extensive feminist scholarship on care if they are to challenge the deeply care-less view of the citizen that is implicitly accepted in new and older forms of liberal thinking. The rational economic actor model of the citizen is contrasted with the care-full view of the citizen and the implications of both for education are explored. (Contains 2 figures and 9 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">This article considers multicultural education policies in relation to recent political and social events in England, France and Canada. The authors start from the assumption that the promotion of multiculturalism is thought to be a beneficial aim in schools. In light of this, they contrast this aim with the large civil unrest witnessed in 2005 in England and France, along with a recent 2006 court decision in Canada regarding minority rights in schools. They contend that effective multicultural policies must be developed at both the state and local levels, otherwise multicultural education policies will remain superficial at best.

      <str>Koustourakis, Gerasimos</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article looks critically at Greek educational reform to the curriculum of compulsory education--reform that took place so that Greece could put into practice the decisions of the European Union of Lisbon (2000) for the contribution of education to the adaptation of the new data of the &amp;quot;knowledge society&amp;quot;. Bernstein's theory about pedagogic discourse is utilized. Also, with the use of qualitative content analysis in specific resources (parliamentary debates, new curriculum and textbooks) we tried to answer the following questions: Which are the dominant social principles that led the Greek state to change the curriculum? Through which process and with the contribution of which factors did the reform of the curriculum come about? And which are the characteristics of the new school knowledge and of the pedagogic practices that are selected for their reproduction at the level of the classroom? (Contains 1 note.)</str>

    <str name="title">Habitual Practice vs. the Struggle for Change: Can Informal Teacher Learning Promote Ongoing Change to Professional Practice?</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Attard, Karl</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In this article the relationship between teacher change and teacher learning is analysed. Data presented here were gathered through self-study research over a 30-month period, during which the author, as a teacher-researcher in Malta, systematically recorded observations and reflections into a reflective journal. This article addresses issues such as: (a) how habitual routines that are technical in nature are formed, and how these tend to distance the practitioner from consciously developing and learning, and subsequently changing and improving professional practice; (b) how uncertainty regarding an innovation in the educational field might induce the need for both change and development; (c) how continuous learning and critically questioning beliefs and assumptions is important for change to occur; (d) how important determination on the practitioner's part is in the fight against the status quo; and (e) how reflective practice can be seen as a corrective to experiential over-learning.</str>

    <str name="title">Examining Dominant Discourses of Sexuality in Sexuality Education Research</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Allen, Louisa</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article is concerned with some of the theoretical and methodological complexities of collecting young people's preferences for sexuality education content and using them to inform educational practice. Data are drawn from focus groups and questionnaires undertaken by 16-19-year-olds. Participants' suggestions often reflect dominant discourses of sexuality circulating in wider society, providing insight into social norms and cultural contexts in which they live. Suggestions do not reflect dominant discourses in any simple way, but involve a complex interplay of these and subordinate meanings of sexuality. When working within a methodological framework that values and centres young people's perspectives, these proposals can be problematic. As dominant discourses of sexuality often reinforce social inequalities, programme implementation of young people's suggestions may perpetuate these. How to reconcile a commitment to a methodological paradigm that prioritises young people's perspectives with the creation of sexuality education which promotes social justice is discussed.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Clemente, Aina Tarabini-Castellani</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article analyses the new educational mandate for Latin America, exploring its repercussions on the design and development of certain educational policies. In particular, it concentrates both on the anti-poverty educational agenda (at a global level) and on targeted educational policies (at a regional, national and local level), analyzing, on one hand, their interaction and, on the other, their limits, opportunities and omissions. Within this framework, the article is organised as follows. First, it presents the current anti-poverty educational agenda, analysing its thesis and foundations. Second, it discusses the repercussions of this agenda on Latin America, explaining the emergence, spread and logic of action of targeted educational policies. The third and fourth sections focus on a particular model of educational targeting, initially explaining the features of the programme (called Bolsa Escola) and then presenting an assessment of its impacts from an educational standpoint. Finally, to conclude, it analyses the shortcomings and omissions of both targeted educational policies and the global anti-poverty agenda. (Contains 1 table and 13 notes.)</str>

    <str name="title">The Europeanisation of German Ethnic Identities: The Case of German and Turkish Students in Two Stuttgart Secondary Schools</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Faas, Daniel</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Germany's national (or ethnic) identity has become thoroughly European and there are even signs of Eurocentrism. This is particularly problematic for the Turkish Muslims who, arguably, are not European. This article explores how fifteen-year-old German and Turkish youth in two Stuttgart secondary schools, one in a predominantly working-class area (Tannberg Hauptschule) and the other in a more middle-class environment (Goethe Gymnasium), negotiate their identities. Drawing on documentary sources, focus groups and semi-structured interviews, the research found that at Tannberg, which at times adopted a Eurocentric approach and where some teachers were getting close to being Islamophobic, young people developed ethno-national identities. In contrast, at Goethe, which promoted European values alongside rather than instead of multicultural values, young people employed national-European hybrid identities. This article raises important questions about the role of education in the development of identities, and how to address notions of cultural insensitivity and inequality.

    <str name="title">Education and State Formation Reappraised--Chinese School Identity in Postwar Singapore and Hong Kong</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Wong, Ting-Hong</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">After World War II the Singapore government, wishing to blend the island's several ethnic communities into a national whole, endeavored to replace Chinese schools, which imparted students with cultural-linguistic traits sharply different from those promoted in other schools. This policy, nevertheless, elicited tough resistance from Singapore's ethnic Chinese population. The government, finally, was forced to recognize Chinese schools as a discrete and integral section within the educational system. This approach reduced the tension between the government and the Chinese masses. However, it allowed Chinese schools continue to produce social fragmentation and slowed state formation. In contrast, although the government of Hong Kong had never aimed to replace Chinese schools, many of its policies unintentionally Sinicized non-Chinese schools and blurred the cultural distinctiveness of Chinese institutions; this, consequently, prevented Chinese schools from becoming a catalyst of social disintegration and helped consolidate state domination. This study suggests the connection between state formation and the educational system is reciprocal and interactive. It also urges scholars to pay more attention to the unintended consequences of state intervention when examining state formation and education. (Contains 10 notes.)</str>

    <str name="title">Developing an Ambivalence Perspective on Medical Labelling in Education: Case Dyslexia</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Solvang, Per</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">There are several social actors involved in the process of constructing the social meaning of dyslexia--namely, parents, teachers, educational authorities and organisations representing dyslectics. Some of these actors emphasise the constructive social powers related to the dyslexia label, while others perceive dyslexia as diagnostic reasoning counter productive to the learning processes. In the discussion of this paradox, this article uses sociological medicalisation theory as a provider of perspectives on medical labelling as contested, and on how the labelling process is socially structured. Empirically, the article is based on four studies in Scandinavia of the construction of dyslexia in different social settings, such as individual life stories, parent stories, educational politics and the legal system. The medicalisation perspective is found most useful for the understanding of undesirable effects. To understand reported experience of medical labelling as empowering, other sociological perspectives are more useful.</str>

    <str name="title">Putting Teacher Experience Back into Curriculum Theory: Case Studies from Japan</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Mitsuno, Momoyo</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Teachers have been understood in their functional role and collective agency in sociology. In this article, the author rethinks the structure and agency dimension of teaching in the context of Japanese school education in transition. The new curriculum in Japan puts emphasis on children's subjective experience of learning. This article explores the mirroring process of teaching in this curriculum transition from role-oriented to subject-focused. The author introduces two experiences as teacher reform movements: a teachers' association and blogs which write about classroom teaching experiences. The findings suggest that there is a cultural transformation occurring within teachers as a group. For analysis, the author draws on the sociological idea of generations. The transformation in teachers' self-consciousness is significant because it creates a gap between self and representation not only externally (how educational reform describes teachers) but internally. The author concludes that this internal experience is ignored in the map of curriculum as structure and teaching as agency. (Contains 20 notes.)</str>

      <str>Tse, Thomas Kwan Choi</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Following the resumption of Chinese sovereignty in 1997, the Hong Kong Government has introduced a new national education project which aims at building nationalism and patriotism. With an active involvement of the state and civil society in promoting national education in recent years, there have been certain drastic changes in the school system--reforms in the curriculum with more weight to national identity and China's topics, more nationalistic or patriotic extra-curricular activities and rituals, and more training for teachers to conduct national education. Informed by a Gramscian notion of hegemony, this paper analyses the advent of and struggles over the national education policy and illustrates the collaboration and contests among various groups in the nation-building project--with the controversies over display of the national flag and liberal studies curriculum as examples.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article explores the possibilities of shifting ethnocentric bias in curricula and pupils' constructions of national and European identities using the concept of &amp;quot;Europe&amp;quot; as a tool. The European dimension was conceptualized as a subtle approach, within the deeply divided society of Cyprus, to alleviate the ethnocentrism of history and geography curricula and to shift pupils' extreme views. The study showed that there were slight yet important shifts which point towards the potential of education in providing children with a wider range of &amp;quot;tools&amp;quot; with which to construct their identities. It is argued that in a context where &amp;quot;Europe&amp;quot; is a &amp;quot;normativity&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Other = Turk&amp;quot; is polarized, the European dimension might be useful to hybridize a European identity so as to include the &amp;quot;Others&amp;quot;.

Yet, to date there has been no single coherent national Government strategy that has successfully closed the gap in educational attainment between either Black and White pupils or between Black pupils and the national average. Academic and policy debates centring on the causes and potential ways of addressing this gap remain marred by controversy and disagreement. This paper is based on qualitative research, which explores how staff and pupils at an inner city secondary school in the south of England construct academic success. Focusing on one aspect of the findings, it reveals that staff subscribe to two forms of success: an inclusive, low D to G grade success and an exclusive, high A* to C grade success, each of which are seen as attainable only by certain types of pupils. The appearance and behaviour of Black pupils, particularly those engaged in what is termed &amp;quot;Black street culture&amp;quot;, are seen as directly at odds with the aims of the school and therefore minimize their likelihood of attaining success in exclusive terms.

    <str name="title">The Role of Special Education Teachers in Primary Schools in Greece</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Boutskou, Evangelia</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Over the last 20 years special education teachers have emerged as a distinct but heterogeneous occupational group in Greece. This paper looks at how special education teachers perceive their job and their role. I explore how teachers give meaning to their experiences and how these experiences influence their practice. The different discourses and ambiguities over inclusion, integration and special education indicate the complexity of this area and of teachers' roles. The uncertainty over their role, the tensions with other professionals and the changing policy context and policy shifts create significant inconsistencies. This paper reveals that teachers are part of a network of professionals with contested interests in the field, and that there are numerous controversies and paradoxes in special education in Greek primary schools. I argue that teachers' voices can contribute to the current debate about inclusion, and that it could possibly facilitate a change in the nature of debate in Greece. (Contains 1 table.)</str>

    <str name="description">This paper discusses the sociological issues raised by a recent study on school councils in England. This study revealed a lack of clarity among policy-makers and schools regarding the purpose of provision for pupil voice. The paper argues that this allows important questions about the functions of pupil voice to be avoided. While suggesting ways in which schools could refine their provision, the paper asks whether more effective pupil voice would make the concept less attractive to policy-makers and schools in the first place. It goes on to highlight more fundamental questions raised by critiques of notions of &amp;quot;voice&amp;quot;. Connected to this, the paper outlines the potential for pupil voice to support neo-liberal as well as progressive ends. It concludes by arguing that teachers must grasp the opportunities provided by pupil voice to ensure that it serves &amp;quot;collaborative&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;managerial&amp;quot; professionalism.

    <str name="title">Inclusive Education Policies and the Feasibility of Educational Change: The Case of Cyprus</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Liasidou, Anastasia</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Given the ecumenical pleas and legislative imperatives for more inclusive educational policy and practice, Cyprus has been steadfastly heading towards the realignment of its educational legislation towards a more inclusive discourse. This has been especially true after the implacable criticisms that the UNESCO report cast on the Cyprus educational system in 1997. After that there were, among other things, co-ordinated efforts to accelerate the voting of the 1999 Special Educational Law that proclaimed the rights of disabled children to be educated along with their peers in mainstream classrooms. It is evident, however, that by no means can the theorisation of educational change be confined to the legislative attempts and their consequences. Rather, the attempts towards educational change should encompass the structural as well as the ideological bases upon which the education system is predicated. The official legislation constitutes a single parameter of the entangled network of interconnections and interdependencies underpinning special education policy and practice. Change is based on an array of factors permeating both agents and structures in the constitution of historical periods.</str>

    <str name="description">Dominant conceptions of the world infuse educational experiences for young people in implicit rather than explicit ways--through becoming, as Stuart Hall argues, &amp;quot;the horizon of the taken-for-granted&amp;quot;. In this article we explore these horizons as experienced by New Zealand's neo-liberal generation, currently &amp;quot;in transition&amp;quot; from high school to further education, training and/or employment. As in Britain, further education has become a taken-for-granted feature of post-school horizons for young New Zealanders but it is not a meaningful destination for all of them. The 93 young New Zealanders in our study have grown up during a period of intensive neo-liberal reform, the speed and scope of which were unprecedented in Western economies. We interviewed these young people in their last year of high school and again once they were well embarked on their post-school lives. We explore how the landscapes of choice of these young people have been restructured in neo-liberal times: for some, the influences of parents, teachers, schools, universities and educational policy have come together to construct apparently wide-open horizons in which university is a taken-for-granted destination. For others, however, these influences have remained subject to assumptions about &amp;quot;race&amp;quot; and class that have a long history in New Zealand and the result has been a narrowing of future possibilities for participants. In all cases, we are concerned to explore the costs that are borne by these young people in this new environment. (Contains 9 notes.)</str>

    <str name="description">Here we examine New Labour's education policy concerning social justice and the organisation of educational provision with reference to social capital as policy vocabulary. The central focus is on policy discourses and practices in relation to networking between schools and other partners. We identify three policy phases for reducing inequalities and social exclusion, while supporting human capital formation: (1) EAZs in the late 1990s; (2) refocusing on specialisation and beaconisation, 2000-2003; and (3) transformations signalled by the diversity and choice agenda of the White Paper 2005, academies and trusts. We detect a drift in policy targets and aspirations from the early idealised &amp;quot;new and exciting&amp;quot; kinds of educational participation and democracy, returning to more traditional professionalist arrangements in specialisation/beaconisation, and currently moving in the direction of post-democratic governance in the academies programme, while doing little to challenge processes of stratification of educational institutions or outcomes. We develop the argument concerning the &amp;quot;post-democratic&amp;quot; turn in education policy by exploring the possibilities and limitations of policy-making which deploys social capital vocabulary and mechanisms, ending with the paradox of social capital as a theory of democracy articulating with &amp;quot;post-democratic&amp;quot; educational structures.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Terren, Eduardo</str>
      <str>Carrasco, Concha</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This paper is based on a preliminary exploration of the in-depth interviews and focus groups that are part of a more extensive research project on the education of children of immigrants in Spain. In the process of migration, families undergo profound transformations that are often complicated by extended periods of separation--not only from extended family members, but also from the nuclear family. Though many immigrant families are involved in transnational separation and reunion processes of this kind, there has been little research on the impact of these forms of family transformations on the vision of education held by immigrants. This impact seems to be two-fold. On one hand, family separation and living or work conditions hamper educational support and monitoring; on the other, the experience of migration poses a tremendous faith in the benefits of education and makes families highly motivated in education. The main idea underlying this paper is that an accurate knowledge of the schooling experience of the children of immigrants has to be related to the moral and psychological effects of this adaptive transformation and, in a very special way, to the weave of projects, expectations and frustrations that permeate the life of an immigrant family. The psychosocial consequences of the processes of adjustment and relearning that immigration entails, the need for a comparative perception of success and the willingness to make an effort and work hard make immigrant families strongly meritocratic and--contrary to some common beliefs--able to show a high level of commitment and expectations in relation to the education of their children.

    <str name="description">Considerable problems have arisen in New Zealand universities as a consequence of the conflict between the statutory role of the university as the &amp;quot;critic and conscience of society&amp;quot; and the dominant intellectual orthodoxy of cultural essentialism. A number of examples are used to show the extent to which culturalist ideological conformity compromises the scientific and critical analysis of social phenomena, thereby limiting the university's ability to serve as the critic and conscience of society. The New Zealand examples are located in the global context of culturalist orthodoxy. The writers claim that, as a consequence of the shift from class to identity politics that characterises multiculturalism, administrators and academics in a number of Western universities are now obliged to defer to politically powerful interest groups that derive their power to condemn from culturalist principles.</str>

    <str name="title">Understanding Time in Learning Transitions through the Lifecourse</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Colley, Helen</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Policy-makers in the UK and Europe have become concerned with the successful management of transitions in learning as a means of increasing the competitiveness of their economies. Transitions relating to informal as well as formal learning have also been an important focus for the sociology of education. In this paper, I review alternative ways in which transitions are conceptualised as a process of change over time; but argue that the dimension of &amp;quot;change&amp;quot; has been overemphasised, while the dimension of &amp;quot;time&amp;quot; has been neglected. Much of the literature on transitions takes for granted a &amp;quot;common sense&amp;quot; view of time as a &amp;quot;natural flow&amp;quot; and assumes that learning can enable us to forge our own futures agentically from lessons of the past and goals in the present. Feminist research, however, challenges such a theory as androcentric, and reveals the many ways in which women's time is used and experienced differently. Drawing on critical sociological thinking about time, these ideas are illustrated through a re-interpretation of data from Mojab's (2006) study of Kurdish women refugees in Sweden. This explores the ways in which time is engendered and enacted in social practices marked by gender, race and class, and the impact of these times upon the women's learning. The potential of such an analysis points to the need for further study of these themes. (Contains 1 figure.)</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Avis, James</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The paper addresses a number of issues concerning policy and curriculum in post-compulsory education and training (PCET). Firstly, it seeks to locate PCET within its socio-economic context as it is this that frames curricula within the learning and skills sector and serves to legitimate its particular form. Secondly, the paper addresses the manner in which state policy impacts upon the sector and is followed by a discussion of curricula issues. It is argued that the rhetoric of competitiveness is over-stated and that this serves to tie educational processes to economic needs. This is reflected in curricular divisions as well as differentiations between learners. These, rather than challenging existing social relations, serve to conserve these resulting in a &amp;quot;transformist&amp;quot; politics. The paper concludes with a section that explores the struggle for social justice, arguing that a radical educational politics needs to address inequalities endemic in wider society. Localized educational responses are limited and can only take us so far in the struggle for social justice. (Contains 4 notes.)</str>

    <str name="title">The Management and Legitimisation of Educational Inequalities in Australia: Some Implications for School Experience</str>

    <str name="description">The challenges for education systems of student disaffection in working-class schools are well known, but the implications of high levels of student optimism in the absence of the resources needed to support academic success have been less often considered. Through examination of the school experiences post-compulsory learners in Australia, this paper seeks to identify some of the ways in which disadvantaged schools are able to command confidence and optimism from students. Analysis of the perspectives of students in schools catering to large numbers of second-generation Turkish-background students suggests that gender and ethnicity organise, make legible and obscure the production of educational disadvantage in these sites. I discuss the implications of strong confidence and faith in schools amongst students in light of contribution of this investment to a wider system of management and legitimisation of inequalities in schooling.

    <str name="title">Social Class and Access to Higher Education in Greece: Supportive Preparation Lessons and Success in National Exams</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Sianou-Kyrgiou, Eleni</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Participation in the national exams is a very difficult task for Greek lyceum students as their access to higher education is highly dependent on their performance in them. This paper focuses on the students' preparation for the national exams and especially their resort to out-of-school supportive lessons in relation to their socio-economic background. The study examines whether the widening of participation reduces social inequalities or not. It also examines the possibility of their resort to different forms of out-of-school support and the cost of it in relation to their families' socio-economic background and their performance. The findings give evidence that there is a close relationship between parents' socio-economic state and the form of out-of-school support as well as the students' performance in the national exams. High social class parents increase the possibilities of their children's turn to the out-of-school support and especially to the most expensive and effective forms of it, as it can ensure high performance and access to high academic status departments. It has become a means for high social class parents to help their children face competition and ensure the reproduction of their social privileges. All this leads to the conclusion that in spite of the fact that the vast majority of the Greek students attend public lyceums, the out-of-school support has led to the commercialization of education and the public character of education tends to be dismissed.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Bhopal, Kalwant</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article examines Asian women's experiences of belonging to communities of practice within higher education in Britain. The research explores the ways in which women engage in friendship and support networks, how they negotiate their identities and their experiences of being marginalised and &amp;quot;different&amp;quot;. The research argues that Asian women within the university environment are engaged in &amp;quot;communities of practice&amp;quot;, which act as mechanisms through which they are able to find support, mutual engagement and understandings of shared belongings and shared identity. The paper draws on the work of Wenger (1998) to examine the processes of identity construction as experienced by Asian women in higher education. The research is based on 20 case study interviews conducted with Asian women in a university in the South East of England. The interviews were tape-recorded and the data transcribed. The data was analysed by using methods of grounded theory (Strauss and Corbin 1990).</str>

    <str name="description">This paper offers a reading of the Dovrat Report with the aim of assessing the convoluted and dialectical manifestations of the state--&amp;quot;the weak and the strong state&amp;quot;--in the era of global neo-liberalism. The Dovrat Report (Ministry Of Education 2005) includes a set of recommendations aiming to bring about structural and comprehensive changes in Israel's education system. We argue that this report, like many other educational reforms implemented elsewhere in the world and articulated against neo-liberal ideology, actually promotes a Janus-faced political entity in the field of education (and similarly in other fields). Thus, while the state seemingly withdraws from educational affairs through decentralisation and privatisation policies, it increases its involvement in these affairs in dictating the goals of education; in setting uniform standards of scholastic achievements; in the cultivation of children possessing the values and skills required by neo-liberal globalisation; and in imposing a national value system intended to render them loyal citizens of their patria. In promoting these contradictory goals, the state often operates indirectly; it develops a tight but elusive regulatory system operated from a distance. Thus, through a set of well-defined activities, the strong state functions at the background of the weak state, challenging claims that the state crucially loses its power under the global order.

    <str name="description">In the past 10 years, violence taking place in schools has entered both popular and academic discourse. Frequently, the term &amp;quot;school violence&amp;quot; is used as a catch-all concept to refer to disorder and disruption in schools, as well as the unruliness of contemporary youth. This is apparent not only in the North American context, but in highly politicised debates regarding standards of pupil behaviour in countries across Europe. A related and significant development is the emergence of the study of violence in schools as a specialist area of enquiry. Drawing on sociological theories of the emergence of social problems, and social constructionist approaches in particular, this paper addresses the rising concern with &amp;quot;school violence&amp;quot; as a social phenomenon. First it addresses the rise of the problem, emphasising connections with wider agendas, particularly anxieties about dangerous youth. The role of the media and academics is also considered. Moreover, this paper explores the emergence of the specialist field and related debates about meaning. It is argued that the present disquiet about &amp;quot;school violence&amp;quot; requires to be understood in the context of modernity and accompanying concerns about social cohesion.</str>

    <str name="title">Neo-Liberal &amp;quot;Governmentality&amp;quot; in the English and Japanese Higher Education Systems</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Yokoyama, Keiko</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The purpose of this paper is to identify common patterns in central authorities' steering of universities and the institutional power in neo-liberal higher education regimes. The paper examines the regulatory mechanisms of England and Japan through Foucault's idea of &amp;quot;governmentality&amp;quot; and utilises the concept of autonomy to identify the state-university nexus and institutional behaviour. The paper argues that the similar application of technologies of arts in England and Japan--such as financial incentives and output quality management--has not brought about the same effect across the two countries in institutional behaviour and culture. In the case of England, the decline of traditional university autonomy--which isolated the university sector from external pressure--and increasing external influence in the value system are the case, while in Japan, the shift is rather internal within an institution, changing from department to institutional autonomy, which is compatible with the concept of accountability.

      <str>Young, Michael F. D.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article is concerned with the development of social scientific knowledge (exemplified by the case of sociology of education) and its relationship to education policy. It draws on and contrasts the experience of the author in working at the interface between theory and policy in two very different contexts: the United Kingdom in the 1970s and 1990s and South Africa since 1990. It argues for attention to both the state of the intellectual field and the wider political context in which both sociology of education and education policy are located and makes the case for the continuing importance of the autonomy of disciplinary analysis and of the university as the major site in which disciplinary knowledge can be developed.

    <str name="description">This article discusses two projects supported by the Higher Education Active Community Fund, which involved student and staff volunteers in working with local communities and community-based organisations in two London boroughs. Oral history methods were used to investigate and represent the experiences of elderly people living in Borough A and young people who have been in foster care in Borough B and their carers. Both projects involved collecting detailed life stories on video and editing these for exhibition in the public domain. The video for Borough A was to form part of the Council's website, the older people's portal. The video for Borough B was to be used to train people providing professional services to young people in foster care and to involve the young people in filming, editing and producing a soundtrack. The article discusses the aims and context of the two projects and critically reviews the learning experiences involved. It analyses issues raised by volunteering, working with local communities, and attempting to represent marginalised experience. It reflects critically on notions of community and community development and discusses relations between oral history projects and community definition, higher education and society.</str>

    <str name="description">This article focuses on teachers' dual frustrations caused by contradictory requirements in Korean education reform policies since 1995. It summarizes recent education policy reforms in Korea and links them to the intensification of teachers' work through the extension of its range, and the possibility that teachers' work will be deskilled by requirements to develop new technical skills with limited resources. Above all, teachers, who have tried to overcome standardized classroom teaching, and have been frustrated by limited resources and the existing school system, are now being frustrated again by recent re-standardization policies.

    <arr name="author">
      <str>David, Miriam E.</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article uses feminist methodologies of critical and personal reflections to consider the contributions that feminist sociology and sociology of education have made to developments in the pedagogies and practices of higher education, particularly professional and postgraduate education. First, the article reviews the contributions of women and feminists to developing feminist theories and methodologies over the last three or four decades. It considers, in particular, the ways in which these developments around the notions of personal and political have become more complex as generations of women as academics and students have entered the academy. These complexities are linked to the wider social and economic transformations and especially changing forms of liberalism, from social democracy, through economic liberalism to neo-liberalism. These developments are spelled out briefly and linked to changing forms of higher education. The second half of the article concentrates on developments in higher education and the mystification of postgraduate and professional education under neo-liberalism. A case study of the developments in doctoral and professional education is provided, with an emphasis on how women have become engaged in these practices. Consideration is also given to changing pedagogies and the practice of more personal pedagogies in higher education and how this has developed with respect to a professional doctorate in education. In conclusion, consideration is given to the prospects for the future of these changing developments and the contribution of feminist pedagogies and practices for the renewal of sociology and the sociology of education a d forms of knowledge within the academy.</str>

    <str name="title">Making Connections for Future Directions: Taking Religion Seriously in the Sociology of Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Grace, Gerald</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article argues that a problem for the contemporary sociology of education is that it has operated within a &amp;quot;secularisation of consciousness paradigm&amp;quot;. This has limited both the depth and the scope of its intellectual enquiries. Sociological analysis which elides a religious dimension not only presents an over-simplified view of social relations in &amp;quot;the Modern West&amp;quot;, but it also fails to make an authentic engagement with many socio-cultural and educational situations internationally, where God is far from dead. The article suggests various ways forward for a reorientation of sociological writing and research. (Contains 12 notes.)</str>

    <str name="title">Performance, Culture and the Sociology of Education</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Atkinson, Paul</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The article takes as its starting point my recent ethnography of the Welsh National Opera Company, and the forthcoming monograph &amp;quot;Everyday Arias: making opera work&amp;quot;. In the course of that work I revisited the theme of performance: the ethnography of performance and the performance of ethnography. I discuss briefly the everyday work of the opera producer and director in the rehearsal studio and in the theatre. I suggest that despite the pervasive nature of &amp;quot;performance&amp;quot; in contemporary sociology and anthropology, we have remarkably few studies of performances themselves. Performances by directors and performers are complex interactions, in which cultural forms, vocabularies of motive, emotional and cognitive frames of interpretation are explored by the participants. The director displays many parallels with the pedagogue. Both are preoccupied with eliciting and evaluating the performances of others. More generally, we ought to expand the sociology of education to take greater account of a wide range of cultural settings. Sociologists of education could learn much about instruction and learning by paying more attention to masterclasses in music and the visual arts, the work of cultural entrepreneurs such as impresarios, artistic education such as choir schools and conservatoires, and similar environments. Furthermore, the sociology of education could and should benefit from a more thorough engagement with contemporary sociologies of art and culture. While the sociology of culture has become central to many aspects of current sociological research and theorising, the sociology of education seems oddly peripheral to mainstream cultural analysis. It is surely not necessary to identify the sociology of education in narrowly institutional terms and to restrict the research gaze primarily to institutions and settings that are narrowly and commonsensically &amp;quot;educational&amp;quot; in nature.</str>

    <str name="title">School-to-Work Transitions: Why the United Kingdom's Educational Ladders Always Fail to Connect</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Roberts, Ken</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article reviews trends in school-to-work transitions since the 1970s and argues that educational expansion (more young people extending their school and college careers) is a large part of the problem, rather than an actual or potential solution to young people's transition difficulties. The causes of educational expansion are identified as more ambitious parents and young people, educational institutions seeking 'bums on seats', the changing occupational structure, and government policies. The reasons why extended education inevitably fails to fulfil its promises to more and more post compulsory students are outlined; the article then concentrates on labour market outcomes for earlier leavers. Their risks of unemployment remain stubbornly high, despite new and allegedly improved training schemes, more relevant courses and qualifications, New Labour's New Deal, and Connexions. The article explains why adding more rungs to educational ladders will only exacerbate school-leavers' difficulties. (Contains 4 tables.)</str>

    <str name="title">Sociology and the Sociology of Higher Education: A Missed Call or a Disconnection?</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Deem, Rosemary</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The article explores the relationship between sociology and sociology of education in the United Kingdom (UK), with specific reference to the development of a sociology of higher education. Though the article is mainly concerned with the UK, the broader issues raised, about the status and location of the sociology of education in relation to sociology, who defines research excellence and research prestige and who collaborates with whom (and why) in social science research, are much more widely relevant. There are three main themes. The first concerns the recent history of sociology of education in the UK and its current location in education departments in higher education institutions. The second theme examines the factors that may have led to or are symptomatic of sociology of education's separation from sociology itself. The third theme is the prospect for the development of the sociology of higher education and its potential for collaborative activity with sociologists and other social scientists. In conclusion, it is argued that the sociology of higher education is well placed to collaborate with sociology and other social sciences, whether in research or in programmes for new academics and professional doctorates.

    <str name="title">Stability and Change as Reflected in Teachers' Educational Fantasies</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Tubin, Dorit</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The article aims to reveal teachers' dispositions concerning stability and change in the field of schooling and to suggest some possible connection to the social space. Forty teachers who attended a principals' training course were asked to write educational fantasies regarding their "dream school". A content analysis of the fantasies showed similarities, such as: respecting student diversity, core curriculum and subjects of choice, a variety of teaching methods and a rich physical environment, and differences regarding: time and space configuration, classroom size and the schoolyard and recreation area. Most (75%) of the desired models view the school as preparing the student for society, while 25% perceive it as a place for the fulfilment of students' potential. The conclusion is that educational reforms are likely to succeed if they follow the trend toward more diversity, choice and pluralism, but at the same time respect the areas of difference. Further research is needed to elaborate on the educational fantasy as a research tool. (Contains 4 tables.)</str>

    <str name="title">Three Bolognas and a Pizza Pie: Notes on Institutionalization of the European Higher Education System</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Tomusk, Voldemar</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Quietly, without attracting too much attention from educational sociologists in Europe, a massive process has been underway for five years that is expected to revolutionize European higher education to an unprecedented extent. Launched by a number of European governments and subsequently taken over by the European Commission, the so-called Bologna Process is expected to boost European higher education to the top of the world higher education markets by 2010. This article looks at the history of the Process and its connections to the process of constructing the federal Europe, and analyses its three agendas: cultural, political and economic. In the final section the issue of institutionalizing the European higher education system is discussed and problematized. It concludes that the contribution European intellectuals have made to the project is both sociologically naive and intellectually irresponsible.</str>

    <str name="title">Understanding Working-Class &amp;quot;Drop-Out&amp;quot; from Higher Education through a Sociocultural Lens: Cultural Narratives and Local Contexts</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Quinn, Jocey</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The &amp;quot;drop-out&amp;quot; of working-class students from universities has been identified as one of the most pressing issues for the higher education (HE) sector in the United Kingdom. This article draws on the initial findings of a major research project that explores the meanings and implications of such withdrawal from HE amongst young working-class people. The article argues that drop-out should be seen not just as an educational problem, but also as a manifestation of sociocultural change. To understand drop-out we need to look beyond student support needs or institutional barriers to cultural narratives and local contexts. This enables us to use a sociological frame to understand the educational question, and employ the educational data to contribute to sociological debates on class. The article analyses &amp;quot;drop-out&amp;quot; as a self-fulfilling cultural narrative that is increasingly connoted as working class, as well as being a consequence of the material exigencies of working-class circumstances. It illustrates how class identity mutates yet stays the same, with the working class still positioned in terms of &amp;quot;lack&amp;quot;. Although the possibility of university study has become a part of working-class identity, the expectation that this experience may be &amp;quot;flawed&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;spoilt&amp;quot; has also become engrained. The article analyses drop-out as two sides of one coin: as both significantly influenced by local culture and as having a perceived impact upon that culture, with different effects in different locales.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Liu, Ruo-Fan</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Students attain cultural knowledge to navigate college admissions, yet few studies investigate when and how students activate this knowledge in a relatively transparent system. Drawing upon 26 Taiwanese student interviews, this study unveils how students strategically use available information to illuminate each step of the admission process. I compare how middle- and working-class students activate cultural knowledge in high-, average-, and low-scoring segments. I show that the notion of cultural knowledge varies according to institutional contexts. In Taiwan, it refers to basic knowledge of explicit, yet complex rules which are taken for granted by the privileged, rather than implicit knowledge of the opaque, behind-the-scenes aspects of the system. I find Taiwanese middle-class students with average test scores take advantage of the information transparency to dramatically modify their strategies to gain admissions from prestigious universities. Students in high- and low-scoring groups, however, utilize this knowledge at much lower levels.</str>

    <str name="description">Young people's unemployment and social exclusion -- the so-called 'youth problem' -- is one of the main focuses in Finnish youth policies. We examine youth policies and youth support systems by applying a framework of policy analysis developed by Carol Bacchi. We ask (1) what kind of problematisations in youth policies and their implementations produce this 'youth problem' in Finland, (2) what are the assumptions behind these problematisations, and (3) what are the similarities and differences of these problematisations in youth policies and their implementations? We analyse youth policy documents and ethnographic and interview data from two youth support systems: One-stop Guidance Centres and outreach youth work. We suggest that both the policies and their implementations produce two discourses: the lack of young people's participation in economic activities, and the immaturity of young people. We also conclude that these discourses are attached to two contradictory ways of governing: neoliberal and paternalistic governing.</str>

    <str name="description">Arab teachers in Jewish schools (AJ) constitute a unique case of minority teachers. This mixed-methods study set out to examine the school experience of AJ (N = 101) in comparison with two groups: Arab teachers in Arab schools (AA; N = 76) and Jewish teachers in Jewish schools (JJ; N = 99). The questionnaire measured three aspects of the teachers' experience: motivational, professional and ecological. AJ teachers reported lower levels of professional difficulties than the two same-culture groups. Among AJ, novice and experienced teachers reported similar levels of motivation, while among the other groups, novice teachers reported lower levels. AJ teachers' answers to an open-ended question enriched the understanding of the positive experiences alongside the negative aspects that included some incidents of racism and microaggression. The findings support the benefit of contact to positive attitudes and tolerance. Nonetheless, questions arise regarding the processes that underlie these results.</str>

    <str name="description">In this article, we show how collaboration between Danish municipal primary and lower secondary schools (&amp;quot;folkeskoler&amp;quot;) and elite sports clubs to establish SportsClasses enables schools to set parameters that align student-athletes' attitudes and behavior towards school and academic performance. Using neo-institutional theory, we show how two separate institutional domains -- education and sport -- come to agree on common purposes and practices for an endeavor that takes place on the 'home field' of education. We apply the theoretical concepts of 'contractualisation' and 'accountability' to understand what these learning agreements or implicit social contracts involve, how they are made, and how they are enforced. These concepts capture the empirical governance mechanisms that produce the integration of athletes into school norms and practices as well as how these norms and practises are re-configured as an effect of the cooperation. The article is based on an ethnographic study of the admissions process for SportsClasses. We discuss the benefits and risks for the publicly funded school system in entering into such social learning contracts.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Chandran, Meera</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Teachers' work in India is impacted by the ongoing restructuring of school education that incorporates simultaneous attempts at reform and regulation. Child-friendly assessment policy instituted by the local bureaucracy leads to intensification of teachers' administrative roles, drawing their attention away from critical pedagogic ones. Limitations in policy interpretation are found to be in response to the official discourse of efficiency that manifests in performative measures of accountability inconsistent with the intended reforms. In this ethnographic case study in an urban middle school for poor, teachers' attempts to comply with instruments of accountability while adapting to changing pedagogic relations with their students and achieve coherence in their identities are examined. The paper draws attention to the contrasts between models of good teaching held by teachers, vis-à-vis the official discourse. It argues for a reworking of the existing model of accountability towards incorporating a cultural-political conception of pedagogy.</str>

    <str name="description">This article argues for using French pragmatic sociology to explore tensions regarding teachers' work, by studying critique formulated by teachers themselves. Based on interviews with teachers in Swedish adult education it shows how teachers labour to reconcile 'what is' with 'what should be' by voicing critique. The findings suggest that, while some critique echoes institutionalised conventions without questioning them, formulating critique is also a way of resisting, where teachers tap into alternative conventions, or disengage from established practices. Some choose to ignore institutional rules, while others change jobs. These findings establish that some critique can serve to maintain the status quo and its institutionalised truths. However, pushing at reality through acts of critique can also fracture reality, which in turn allows other conventions to take root in the cracks. Identifying the various types of critique employed to question institutionalised conventions highlights the work that teachers do to shape reality.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper emerges from a seven-year, ongoing relational poetics between two poets and their former secondary English teacher. Organized by the world's urgencies, the three authors have studied the force of poetry throughout incidences of violence against Black lives close to home and across the United States. This practice began in the classroom and continues beyond graduation through remote correspondence across three cities. Through it we develop the concept of study as &amp;quot;love,&amp;quot; engaging with Moten &amp;amp; Harney's concept of study as irreducibly social and in excess of institutional parameters. We also develop the concept of poetics as more than methodology, engaging with Glissant's poetics of relation. Through love and poetics, we call for literacy studies engaged with the ontogenesis of Black life, moving beyond institutionally white disciplinary methods and standard research outputs. We ask how the poetics of relation and the love of study produce new worlds.</str>

    <str name="title">Ethical Perplexities of Researching with Children in Uncertain Times: A Dialogic Approach</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lee, Claire</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In this article I compare two studies, one pre- and one post-COVID-19, to consider the ethics of researching with children, especially during uncertain times. I argue that ethics are entwined with assumptions about children, 'voice', relational dynamics and representation. To reflect upon those assumptions and their ethical implications, I draw upon three Bakhtinian dialogical principles: that the self is in its nature responsive and never fully knowable or complete; that meaning-making is a complex, dynamic, situated activity; and that finalisation is deeply unethical. I propose a dialogic approach to researching with children as an ethical orientation which respects our common humanity and agency and allows for trust, sensitivity, responsive meaning-making, openness and inarticulacy. I also consider the perplexities of achieving dialogic relationships and meaningful dialogue with children, especially at times when researcher and participants may be separated physically in space and time and when methodological compromises may be unavoidable.</str>

    <str name="description">This study chronicles a research project on writing development that was affected by the current contexts of uncertainty. We were set to follow 24 students from diverse admissions channels for three years, during which we held meetings and collected writing materials. In October 2019, an unprecedented wave of civil unrest led to the closure of the campus and ended face-to-face meetings. In early 2020, just as the university was resuming contact with students, the COVID-19 pandemic again forced the suspension of in-person meetings. This article addresses methodological, ethical, and epistemological dilemmas involved in researching literacy in higher education under challenging circumstances. Moreover, understanding literacy as a social practice provided a theoretical framework useful to recognise emerging results as valuable information on literacy knowledge. The unexpected findings on student writing were shaped by the context of the crisis, in which agency, student engagement, and sponsorship became intrinsically linked to national events.</str>

    <str name="description">In this article, we reflect on and examine the experiences of three doctoral students, and their thesis advisor, in discussing how we adjusted our research methods and assumptions to the new conditions of life and society that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss how our understandings of the embodied presence of the researcher, the location of research and writing, and the affordances of digital technologies are becoming more prominent and often rethought as issues of stance. We approach this discussion as co-explorers in charting new conceptions of and strategies toward research, as well as the relationships and mentoring practices between graduate students and their advisor.</str>

    <str name="description">We examine learning as movement as a utopian methodological approach that reorients how we shape and understand literacy learning ecologies with youth who are racialized as non-white. Understanding linguistic practice as integral to learning, and to common beliefs of what it means to be human, we consider how static notions of language are deployed as border-marking tools within settler coloniality, supporting a logic that justifies pernicious racial subordination. Within education, these ideologies frame certain learners as illegitimate and deviant, with particular implications for literacy learning. The learning sciences are uniquely positioned to re-signify what it means to be a literate body and to design learning ecologies in which youth move across these borders. Aligning ourselves with decolonial scholars, we argue that utopian methodology with a learning as movement frame allows us to forefront expansive learning design as we work alongside youth from otherized backgrounds toward alternate epistemic futures.</str>

    <str name="description">This study brings empathy to the centre of literacy practice by investigating children's augmented storying as it was related to empathetic encounters across the human and more-than-human worlds. The study applies sociomaterial theorising that defines empathy as relational and emergent across human-material-spatial-temporal assemblages. The empirical study was situated in a Finnish primary school in which children used an augmented story-crafting tool (&amp;quot;MyAR Julle&amp;quot;) to explore their local environment and to create and share their stories. The findings show how empathy emerged situationally across the children, other human beings, materials, technology and the natural world. The empathetic encounters of the children's narratives were more than romantic or smooth encounters, instead competing and in tension with one another, calling moral reasoning and agency. The study shows the potential of sociomaterial theorising to change the way we think about children's encounters with the world, using empathy as a framework.</str>

    <str name="description">I write as an ethnographer of childhoods and literacies to share a critical methodological lesson I have learned: simply observing children in educational settings will not yield rich understandings of the inequities arising from the interplay of societal constructs of race, class, and gender. Such understandings require ethnographic digs, analogous to those of geologists and archeologists. Surface level educational happenings must be situated in institutional, geographic, and ideological landscapes, both historical and sociopolitical. These foundational layers echo in both formal and informal school practices, including those of peers. To illustrate, I draw on data from a 4-year case study of Ta'Von, a Black child in a white-majority elementary school; I focus on his experiences in 'the achievement gap.' Those experiences, reverberating with local racialized history, suggest that inclusive schools require, not fixing children to eliminate a gap, but fixing the taken-for-granted assumptions and practices of schools.</str>

    <str name="description">Authored by a teacher-researcher design team, this manuscript explores the boundaries and processes of literacy research enacted across perilous timescales. Building from fieldnotes, reflections, and dialogue from a two and a half year social design-based experiment, this study extends scholarship focused on kinship and communities of practice. Through considering the boundaries of where and how critical research is enacted, this paper demonstrates the ethical imperatives for considering when collective research continues or ends. Considering a lineage of solidarity tied to new literacy studies, we examine the multiple activity systems occupied by our community members and explore the pedagogies of healing and reconstitution that emerged. These findings push for speculative approaches to design that center affect and analog interactions. [This article was written with the Digital Democratic Dialogue (3d) Teacher Community.]</str>

    <str name="description">Critical literacy-focused messaging is already propelling place-based meaning-making in communities and streets. Literacy researchers must be part of this public development and revelation. Authors share learning from two longitudinal, publicly-engaged ethnographic projects in different Midwestern United States communities to offer waypoints key to understanding communities' social and spatial processes in highly segregated (by social class and race) locales. Building on key understandings around precarity and responsibility, place in research, and community-based critical equity literacy, these studies reinforce relentlessly examining places people live, grow up, and attend schools bound by values-laden and material geographic touchpoints that mobilize and produce inequities. These acts of placemaking position literacy research and researchers' role as imperative in informing future policy decisions and advocacy for equity with a &amp;quot;precariat&amp;quot; public and offer the layered approaches and multiple perspectives necessary for justice-based work where findings produced will resonate and matter for the publics we serve.</str>

    <str name="description">In this paper, we utilize poetic methods that seek to surface, but not overdetermine, the unanticipated relational excess produced through literacy practices. Karen, a queer white woman, and Jordan, a cis-gendered heterosexual Black man, wrote a series of letters to one another throughout the Spring 2020 semester. We turned to critical poetic inquiry to analyze the letters, interested in poetry's capacity to highlight literacy's critical power and its emergent potential. We found ourselves implicated in each other's lives in new ways; we found our relationship both strengthened and tested. Such relational indeterminacy creates methodological challenges in literacy research. We found critical poetic inquiry to be a uniquely useful method for expressing the ambiguity and incommensurability of literacy as 'affective encounters' (Lenters, 2016), particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as our interdependency and mutual obligation is highlighted.</str>

    <str name="description">This article conceptualizes the notion of magic(al)ing in relation to post-pandemic ways of thinking about data production and analyses. Revisiting old data produced pre-COVID-19 and engaging with new data produced during COVID-19, we consider the possibilities and potential of magic(al)ing as a theoretical concept. We think with several ideas informed by feminist 'new' materialists and post-inspired philosophies to conceptualize magic(al)ing: monism, spacetimemattering, blooms spaces and the pedagogy of an affective world. Over a year, we embarked on a reading/thinking inquiry about magic and literacies and their combined strength in locating literacies as embodied, relational, and sensory. Magic(al)ing has the potential to frame literacy moments as socio-material instances filled with affective flows and intensities. The concept of magic(al)ing fosters a space to not only rethink literacy but also to explore humans in relation to literacies. Kuby returns to an orange-paper-frog-puppet, a magic(al)ing moment that she often comes back to when thinking of the be(com)ing of literacies, especially in the uncertain times we find ourselves in a pandemic. Rowsell returns to a flowery artifact by a little girl who took part in a makerspace study in April 2019, speculating on how the same research could be conducted during lockdown. We also think-with new, unexpected data produced during COVID-19. As we engage again with these magic(al)ing moments, we explore the guest editors' question: What methodological approaches are possible, and which kinds of research collaborations are appropriate?</str>

    <str name="description">Multiple literacy practices, such as writing, texting, blogging and journaling, are intertwined in a crisis. Although many studies have been conducted on literacy practices arising from crises such as a divorce, a disaster and social activism, most of them are focused on a single event. In this chapter, I propose a method for examining literacy practices in dual-layered crises. Drawing from huge data (collected from March 2016-2019), during a commemoration, which doubled up as a protest in Buenos Aires, Argentina, this paper illustrates how the works of literacy or signs in open public spaces can be documented using photographic data. While there is no one fix method, I argue for a systematic approach by asking researchers to think about the subjectivities of managing huge data sets.</str>

    <str name="title">The Role of Schooling in Times of Global Pandemic: A Sociological Approach</str>

      <str>Tarabini, Aina</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">The health emergency generated by COVID-19 and the massive closure of schools has given rise to an unprecedented situation for education systems worldwide. This situation has raised fundamental questions about the role of the school in contemporary societies and whether it still fulfils a particular function as a social institution. This article forwards a theoretical discussion on these issues from a critical sociological approach and, especially, from the perspective of social justice. It argues that the two main functions of schools, namely, socialisation and selection, cannot be fully achieved by distance schooling. Moreover, it contends that the lockdown of schools reinforced the crisis of meaning within the school system by hindering its ability to ensure learning for all students. Overall, the article presents a reflection on the meaning of the school institution in the 21st century, representing a key contribution to contemporary debates on the sociology of education.</str>

    <str name="description">Using the data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11 (ECLS-K:2011), this paper proposes to theoretically redefine and empirically capture the concept of emotional capital as it applies to students, employing five components (engagement, school belonging, grit, peer social support, and life satisfaction). The study demonstrates the associations between students' demographic characteristics and emotional capital on one hand, and the relationships between emotional capital and student behavior, on the other. We found that higher SES students and girls possessed higher levels of emotional capital. Stronger feelings of engagement and school belonging were associated with reduced internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and improved approaches to learning. Grit and peer social support were associated with reduced internalizing behavior problems and improved approaches to learning. Higher level of life satisfaction was associated with reduced externalizing behavior problems. We discuss the implications of these findings to educational policy and practice.</str>

    <str name="description">The COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying existing problems of economic asymmetry, and other injustices, between and within countries and regions around the world. It is thus imperative that sociological studies of education document its socio-cultural implications in different locations and on different scales. It is equally imperative that such studies have a historical perspective that asks what pre-existing social problems have been intensified and how such intensification is happening. This paper responds to these imperatives through the deployment of conjunctural analysis and related crisis and articulation theory. We discuss the global COVID-19 conjuncture as it emerged in the first seven months of 2020 and show how it articulated with the preceding conjuncture. Subsequently, we focus on the issues associated with closing and reopening schools and show how they were intertwined with reconfigurations of the school/home/work nexus. We consider these reconfigurations in two very different locations, Australia and South Africa.</str>

    <str name="description">This article employs Foucault's concepts of docile bodies, Panopticism, surveillance and the paradigm of resistance, subversion and containment to delineate the issues of power and control that shored up in online Higher education in Palestinian universities during the outbreak of the pandemic. We propose that the online mode of education perpetuates the traditional way of teaching literature, impeding both students' and teachers' innovation. Topics related to sexuality, politics, misogyny, and religion in literary works have been repressed in staff members' discussion due to multilayered surveillance from the students, parents and online learning centralized management offices who, based on the testimonies of the literature teachers, are often attentive to online class meetings. Surveillance shatters the illusion of liberation many literacy educators thought they have gained in online education; indeed, the instructors' testimonies highlight their internalization of panoptic surveillance that derails the liberating purpose of education.</str>

    <str name="description">Although more students have formally gained access to higher education, universities continue to present students with norms and ideals that can function as invisible barriers to them. This paper investigates how norms and expectations in Danish higher education pose certain challenges to mature students, who, due to their age and often different life situations, do not fit the characteristics of the ideal student. Based on qualitative data, the paper shows that living up to the ideal includes engaging in social and extracurricular activities, as well as dedicating oneself to being a student. Moreover, the ideal relates to dominant ideas about the normal biography of university students. The paper contributes to the understanding of mature students' experiences and provides a framework for unpacking how norms and ideals pose barriers to some students. Our findings underline higher education institutions' responsibilities in challenging existing norms and ideals.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper draws upon in-depth interviews with 89 students from two UK universities to explore how students from Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) degrees describe the ideal as well as the typical student in their respective disciplines. We provide a comparative insight into the similarities and differences between disciplinary identities based on student perceptions. More specifically, we consider how undergraduates from biology, engineering, mathematics and physics construct the ideal and the typical student in their degree, highlighting the popular discourses and desirable traits that appear to characterise students in these disciplines. In addition to a masculinised construction of students in engineering, mathematics and physics, we found a social hierarchy within STEM degrees where biology was perceived as the easier STEM subject. We conclude with a discussion of the impact of such hierarchies on student identities in STEM, and potential implications for equality, diversity and inclusion.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article focuses on students' experiences of psychosocial problems and how these problems relate to the ideas of 'good students' in higher education. The empirical basis of the article is a qualitative research project following Danish students with a range of psychosocial problems. Forty-seven students were followed for up to 2 years, in several rounds of in-depth interviewing. A key finding of the research is that students with problems often meet the attitude that they are not 'proper' students or 'suitable' for university. Psychosocial problems seem to be understood as antithetical to the prevalent, culturally normative ideas of the 'good student', producing a range of (extra) problems for the students in question. The article discusses this, unfolding two students' examples, pointing out how (academic) self-understanding, individual and independent working routines and dilemmas of getting support challenged them in higher education as they 'climbed Mount Adversity'.</str>

    <str name="title">Grade as a Student&amp;apos;s Lifeblood? Exploring Chinese Rural Students&amp;apos; Evolving Constructions of the &amp;apos;Ideal Student&amp;apos; through Higher Education</str>

    <str name="description">Since the expansion of higher education, many rural students in China managed to enter urban universities. However, migrating across layers of structural constraints, those rural students faced dramatic transitions and challenges in the urban university. Drawing upon 50 rural students' narratives about their educational trajectories, I find that participants in this research moved from the rural context, which almost exclusively emphasized academic performance, to a versatile and complex university culture, featuring implicit and ambiguous expectations of students. The rural students' perceived desirable traits, together with the &amp;quot;suzhi&amp;quot; discourse, reinforced the existing symbolic inequality of the social structure and justified the legitimacy of the dominant group's culture. Moreover, participants generally lacked an accurate grasp of the expectations of students in university, which resulted in a lasting sense of ambivalence and uneasiness. Therefore, exploring the connotation of ideal student is a crucial approach to enable the disadvantaged group to better grasp the hidden mechanisms of urban universities.</str>

    <str name="description">Care experienced and estranged students encounter profound material inequalities throughout their higher education journeys which demand our attention. However, cultural discriminations also pose problems. Both operate as social injustices which preclude them from being included, valued or seen as 'ideal' students, contributing towards inequitable outcomes. Drawing on feminist methodologies, this paper analyses 11 narratives of care experienced and estranged students at a post-1992 English university. This offers confirmatory evidence of material inequalities, including financial precarities and mismatched wellbeing provision. It also adds new insights into how such students are simultaneously subjected to processes of misrecognition. This includes being misinterpreted, disrespected or rendered invisible, excluding them from university lifeworlds and undermining a sense of belonging. Inspired by Nancy Fraser, the paper concludes that we must (continue to) tackle material exclusions alongside processes of misrecognition in order to further a social justice agenda for care experienced and estranged students in higher education.</str>

    </arr>
    <str name="description">In scholarly research, disabilities are predominantly understood as something that obscures assessment rather than enriches it. In this study, I examine how research on assessment adjustments (e.g. extra time in tests and separate testing rooms) portrays disabled students. I discuss how this area of research plays a role in constructing an image of 'the ideal student' and its shadow, the 'non-ideal student'. I conduct a critical review to analyse how 26 assessment adjustment studies portray their object, disabled students, as being ontologically different from &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; students. The 'disabled examinee' is portrayed as 'a spanner in the works' that endangers the objectivity of the assessment systems in higher education. Disabled students are framed as 'Others' who pose a danger for academic standards and integrity: assessment adjustments are thus seen as safeguarding academia from this danger. I argue that this portrayal contributes to marginalising disabled students in higher education.</str>

    <str name="description">In market-oriented higher education (HE) systems, fee-paying students are positioned as customers, and studying is juxtaposed with service use. In this study, we investigate how students position themselves in relation to the student-as-customer discourse in Finnish HE, in which only students coming from outside the EU and EEA areas are charged tuition fees. We investigate the construction of the student-as-customer discourse in the narrative environment of Finnish HE through interviews with both international fee-liable and Finnish non-fee-paying master's degree students (n = 34). In addition, we analyse social differences that are constructed between fee-liable and non-fee-paying students in relation to the student-as-customer discourse. We argue that fee liability creates unequal positions for some international students and thus challenges the equality principles embedded in Finnish HE. Paradoxically, it was also found that the fee-liable student-customers have less freedom and fewer options than the non-fee-paying students.</str>

    <str name="description">Child-rearing practices can be challenging for migrants who often require socio-cultural and emotional adjustments. This article discusses parenting in exile with a focus on the experiences of highly educated Eritrean migrants in the UK. Qualitative data are collected from eighteen highly educated Eritrean migrants selected through purposive and snowball sampling from the UK. The findings indicate that highly educated Eritrea migrants aspire to avoid harmful traditional ways of treating children and all the repercussions associated with them. Moreover, with the help of their educational qualifications, my participants support their children in social and academic activities and guide them to cultivate bi-cultural coping skills. However, the migrant parents face challenges related to lack of parenting experiences and familiar support systems. The article contributes to the advancement of migration knowledge by adding new perspectives to the nexus of migration and child-raising.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper examines the agency of international students in the context of university transformations in post-Soviet Ukraine. Conflict-driven political, social and economic changes in the country have laid the groundwork for the redesign of institutional policies related to the internationalization of Ukraine's higher education. However, it is not clear to what extent local universities have managed to engage the creative power and agency of international students in these transformations. By examining how international students' agency is constructed at 12 public universities, and triangulating comparative findings with data from the Ukrainian State Centre for International Education at the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, and from publicly available sources including social media, this study delves into the complexities of student agency development in the postcolonial discourses at Ukrainian universities. On a theoretical level, this paper enriches the knowledge base on tensions between institutional and human agencies in international higher learning.</str>

    <str name="description">Diaspora communities use school education as a central way to reproduce their identity throughout generations. However, religious institutions, clubs and specific events can also perform a role in reproducing the groups' cultural identity, working as non-formal spaces of education. We examine how diasporic Armenian families in Brazil perceive the roles that formal and non-formal education play in supporting the conservation of their Armenian identity. The paper draws from an ethnographic study conducted in Armenian ethnic institutions in Sao Paulo. Participants expressed having ambiguous feelings towards these organisations, valuing their educational features distinctly. While they do not perceive the everyday practices of the Armenian school as having a central role in reproducing cultural identities, they acknowledge that non-formal educational spaces and one-day events are pivotal to celebrate these identities.</str>

    <str name="description">This paper draws on 'diaspora at home', a concept that encapsulates the unique dynamics between Hong Kong and mainland China, as an analytical tool to explore the cross-border experiences of 23 Hong Kong students at 11 universities in mainland China. It empirically ascertains how the made and imposed claims and identifications of these Hong Kong students resulted in inclusion and exclusion as their interactions with their mainland peers and institutions deepened. Specifically, it highlights how their 'diaspora at home' status offered exclusive access to privileged higher education opportunities, preferential treatments and opportunities for upward social mobility. Meanwhile, such a status also resulted in an overwhelming sense of political liability as they unwittingly became 'political tokens' and suspected political subjects amid the increasingly tense political atmosphere between mainland China and Hong Kong. This paper pinpoints the relevance of class and politics in understanding how diasporic groups engage with higher education.</str>

    <str name="description">International student mobility (ISM) has emerged as an important field of study that various nations and organizations have been attaching great importance to. This paper studies the drivers of international student mobility, using a competing destinations model for the international student flows among 35 OECD countries in the period 2004-2018, by integrating the motivations for ISM. We find that OECD students are motivated by both career orientation and personal and cultural experience when decide to move abroad for study. Nonetheless, remarkable differences emerge when considering country subgroups (origin countries, wealthier, English-speaking top destination (namely US, the UK, Canada, and Australia), and European countries, students search for personal and cultural experience, valuing the lifestyle of the destination country. Students seeking for education quality are instead polarised in the rest of the OECD countries.</str>

    <str name="description">The Australian government has considered youth mobility to the Indo-Pacific to be crucial in building Australia's connection with the region. Despite a growing trend of Australian student mobility to the Indo-Pacific, there has been a dearth of research on mobility youth's agency in public diplomacy. This article makes an original contribution to the literature by elucidating the four main forms of youth agency in public diplomacy in which Australian students have engaged: fostering regional understandings, people-to-people connections, people-to-opportunity connections and country-to-country connections with the Indo-Pacific. It shows that these understandings and connections were created not only during the students' in-country experiences but also upon their return, and the youth-led connections are not limited within the host and home countries. The article suggests a critical need to have a systemic approach to supporting mobility youth's capacity for regional engagement, beyond the traditional student experience in learning abroad, which is concerned largely with academic outcomes, cultural enhancement and employability development.</str>

      <str>Alejo, Antonio</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">This article focuses on the diasporas' role in fostering Global Citizenship Education (GCE) and provides a basis for understanding how diaspora organizations educate themselves to defend their rights in everyday life. I argue that diaspora organizations are potential agents that foster GCE to defend rights in a hostile environment against people in motion. From the GCE-driven critical perspective, this article offers an interdisciplinary dialogue between Diaspora Studies (International Relations), Sociology of Education, and Sociology of Collective Action to identify the practice of GCE at the New American Diaspora in Mexico City. The article is oriented to discussing the non-state actors' agency in promoting GCE outside the walls of schools and classrooms. With a qualitative approach (case study), through an American/Mexican organization, I offer empirical evidence through the lens of GCE: The Others Dreams in Action (ODA) and its cultural space, namely the Poch@ House.</str>

    <arr name="author">
      <str>Cela, Toni</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">In post-disaster societies, critical events intensify diasporic engagements. This article examines the diaspora as a category of practice that mobilizes energies in furtherance of revitalizing Haiti's oft-neglected higher education sector. With rebuilding efforts dependent upon international assistance, the diaspora emerges as an important actor that engages national and international entities in shaping that agenda. Hence, the research question posed here: &amp;quot;How has diaspora engagement in higher education influenced institutional capacity for recovery and reconstruction in post-disaster Haiti?&amp;quot; Conceptualizing the 2010 earthquake as a threshold event that has reconfigured Haitian society and drawing on a post-structuralist notion of power, this article analyzes contexts of engagement where the diaspora negotiated their cultural understanding of higher education with local practices, within larger competing national and transnational power dynamics. These new opportunities for engagement created conditions for the diaspora to move higher education from the margins of national development to the post-disaster rebuilding agenda.</str>

    <str name="description">For decades, Luxembourg did without a national university. Before and after the University of Luxembourg's founding (UL) (2003), tertiary education and the status of being a Luxembourgish student have been closely linked to international student mobility (ISM). This long-standing tradition was maintained in the new university via compulsory ISM: to bolster elite European networks and internationalization. Focusing on ISM from Luxembourg, based on analysis of policy documents regarding the UL's foundation and state allowances for students, we show that policymakers strongly favored ISM. We confront this policy agenda with the perspectives and self-identifications of both credit and degree mobile Luxembourgish students. In narrative interviews, students did not always view compulsory ISM as positively as did policymakers. For students, the &amp;quot;quality&amp;quot; of a stay abroad is far more important: a perspective lacking in the state's &amp;quot;quantity&amp;quot;-driven agenda. In the country with the highest ISM rates globally, constraints continue to hinder equity in ISM.</str>

    <str name="description">This article examines the role of university students during the anti-extradition movement in Hong Kong, analyzing their strategy to mobilize schools' physical, symbolic, and interpersonal resources, and how the authorities reacted by restricting and redefining key resources. Universities have served as a safe space since police officers traditionally are not allowed to enter them. Some schools are also strategically located to allow for more disruptive protests. Since Confucianism venerates the moral value of learning, universities are perceived as a hallowed symbol of intellectual conscience, justifying students' defiance. Universities are commonly seen as warm families whose leaders are obliged to protect students. Finally, universities sustain a rich network of cross-mobilization. The regime restricts access to resources by tightening campus control and reshuffling university leadership, and redefined the symbolic meanings by discrediting higher education. We find interpersonal relationships constitute the most resilient resource because they are embedded in everyday life common identities.</str>

    <str name="title">Vulnerable Autonomy: University Governance in the Context of Student Activism in Hong Kong</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Lo, William Yat Wai</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">A managerial model of shared governance is adopted in Hong Kong's public universities to uphold university autonomy. However, with the political confrontation characterised by the rise of student activism, the sustainability of the managerial form of university autonomy requires review and re-exploration. This paper aims to examine the influence of political unrest on university governance in Hong Kong. Drawing on data from interviews with university council members and student leaders, this paper reveals how university autonomy is upheld in the current governance structure, how different stakeholders variously understand the nature and roles of university, and how these disparate understandings interact with the wider political environment and bring pressure on universities. The paper argues that though university management intended to be politically neutral for upholding institutional autonomy, the space for avoiding politics had been narrowed. This narrowing process illustrates the vulnerability of university autonomy in Hong Kong.</str>

    <str name="description">Based on statistical analysis of the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) international student data from 1998 to 2014, we provide the first detailed analysis of UK international doctoral student data (and the gaps therein). We highlight missing and ambiguous data and develop the profiles of these students, with a particular focus on gender, discipline, destination university, source of funding and country of origin. We argue that the current marketized system of international higher education coupled with a national focus on equality has largely limited the social composition of international doctoral students to those who are: academically capable; and either financially able to pay international tuition fees and subsistence in the UK (for them and their families) or capable of securing overseas funding, primarily from national governments. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of this for the internationalisation of research and knowledge production.</str>

    <str name="description">The 2019 Anti-Extradition Bill movement (Anti-ELAB) in Hong Kong peaked the tactical radicalization of the city's recent protest history. At the same time, it signified unprecedented tactical reconciliation between moderate and radical protestors that maintained strong movement momentum and a high degree of solidarity for a long period. An ethics of solidarity was successfully formulated to illuminate deliberative practices among participants. However, the change of protest spatiality and repertoire from wildcat protesting to temporary occupation at a university campus altered the dynamics of protestors and weakened deliberative communication. This paper illustrates the struggles and learning curves of students who suffered deliberative deficit in the interaction with other protestors. This paper argues that the occupation, despite its contested nature, offered informal experiential learning of civic engagement for the students to their political literacy and civic mentality towards social movement under the intense setting of real politics.</str>

    <str name="description">International students have been historically valued by universities for their contributions to their host countries. Yet, representations of international students in the general public have become increasingly mixed, an issue likely exacerbated by COVID-19, which has shown increased hostility towards international students. Given the increased reports of discrimination during this period, there is ongoing need to understand how international students have been represented in this specific time of crisis. Our study analysed public representations of international students through Twitter data and qualitative analysis of 6,501 posts made during the immediate COVID-19 crisis (January-April 2020). Our findings confirm competing public representations of international students that changed over time: initially through stereotyping and depictions as assumed disease carriers, shifting to empathy and support after university campus closures. We also outline themes of racism and discrimination, which are of importance for the global higher education sector as we move into a post-COVID world.</str>

    <str name="title">International or Refugee Students? Shifting Organisational Discourses on Refugee Students at German Higher Education Organisations</str>
    <arr name="author">
      <str>Berg, Jana</str>
    </arr>
    <str name="description">Following the refugee influx of 2015 and 2016, many German higher education organisations (HEOs) responded with support programmes for refugee students. In this context, refugees became formally and discursively differentiated from other international students. During later stages of the programmes, this differentiation became blurred, and discourse surrounding refugee students partly shifted back to framing them as international students, which is also represented in further support programme development. Based on a systems theoretical framework, this paper investigates the shifting organisational discourse on refugee students within the context of functional needs and structural changes at German HEOs. The analysis shows that structural development is strongly related to the way functional needs and ways to address them are constituted by discursive representations. It is based on 25 expert interviews with heads of international offices and first contacts for refugees at eight German HEOs.</str>

    <str name="description">Higher education spaces are where ideas about citizenships, social norms, and values are mediated between state and youth citizens. In recent years, there has been a rise of new American-style liberal arts initiatives in East Asia, and yet little attention paid to the interface between liberal arts education and youth politics in this region. This article draws upon qualitative research conducted between 2017 and 2019 at two liberal arts universities in Shanghai and Singapore to examine how students fashion political subjectivities and meanings within the spaces that they live and learn in. It argues for a capacious conceptualisation of youth politics to analyse political subjectivities and sentiments as enmeshed in a relational field tied to wider-scale understandings of social movements and progressive ideals. To do so, conventional framings of universities as sites of political mobilisations need to be recast as sites of political citizenship experiments.</str>

It is argued that the youth, as historical beings, promote humanisation by seeking to effect structural changes with the help of the social media. However, the youth-led movements in Hong Kong differ from Freire's ideas in two significant ways. First, the increasingly violent nature of the protests departs from Freire's emphasis on peaceful resistance. Secondly, Freire's call for loving dialogue is not evident in Hong Kong despite meetings between the authorities and protesters. Hong Kong highlights the usefulness of the notion of conscientisation in shedding light on the youth social movement in an Asian context. At the same time, the developments in Hong Kong extend the existing literature on Freirean thought by situating it in a Confucian cultural setting.</str>
