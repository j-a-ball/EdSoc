This study examines the relationship between athletic participation and academic performance
among athletes involved in big-time college sports. Drawing on four years of participant
observation of a major college basketball program, we trace athletes’ involvement in academics
throughout their college careers. We show that, contrary to popular belief, most athletes enter
college with optimistic and idealistic goals and attitudes about their impending academic
careers. However, their athletic, social, and classroom experiences lead them to become
progressively detached from academics. As a result, they make pragmatic adjustments, aban-
doning their earlier aspirations and expectations and gradually resigning themselves to inferior
academic performance. We conclude that the structure of universities with big-time athletic
programs and the athletes’ patterned experiences within these universities undermine their
attainment of the professed goals of the educational system. We discuss several policy implica-
tions of this research.
